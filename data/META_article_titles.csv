0,META,2022-12-21,"Mark Zuckerberg will split Meta, take the 'verse","













NEW YORK, Dec 21 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Meta Platforms (META.O) is the tale of two companies, tied together only by their potential to sell advertising and their owner Mark Zuckerberg. As big marketers tighten pocketbooks in 2023, the social media firm, which operates Facebook and Instagram, will become less of a cash machine. This will encourage its founder and chief to pluck his pet project, the metaverse, away from the rest of the business.

Meta is expected to ink some $15 billion in free cash flow in 2022, according to estimates from Refinitiv, a 60% decline from 2021, in large part because of spending on the virtual universe. But cash flow from Meta’s operations alone – mostly the business without spending on the metaverse – would represent a yield of 15%. That’s three times the free cash flow yield of consumer giant Procter & Gamble (PG.N), and more than oil major Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), which had a banner 2022.

Rather than make Meta shareholders collectively pay for Zuckerberg’s ambitions, he could fund them himself through dividends from the parent company. If all the cash flow from operations went back to shareholders, representing about $18 a share, Zuckerberg would find himself with some $6 billion to reinvest in the project based on his stake. That’s not enough given current spending plans, but a few key investors who sign on to his vision might be keen to invest alongside him.

Zuckerberg might, for now, be more comfortable spending investors’ money. And with a 57% voting stake, any shareholder will struggle to force him to do otherwise. Still, there’s a financial case for him to refocus his efforts. Facebook and Instagram are under the regulatory microscope – and that is starting to hurt the metaverse, too. In December, a high-profile trial between the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Meta kicked off over the company’s deal to buy virtual reality app developer Within. If Meta were smaller, or the metaverse were a separate company, it might not attract the same attention.

Plus, the social media business needs intense focus as spending starts to slow. Zuckerberg – who has never been an operator of a public company through an economic downturn – might not be the best person to lead during a slump. He may loathe to hand over the reins without a distraction. Splitting Meta and taking the 'verse could be a good plan.

1,META,2023-01-04,Meta faces exsanguination by small fines,"













NEW YORK, Jan 4 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Another day, another European fine for Meta Platforms (META.O). The social network was penalized nearly $800 million last year in a series of charges for data breaches and privacy violations. While 2023 is young, it isn't off to a good start. Ireland’s data privacy regulator on Wednesday fined Meta $419 million for improperly serving personalized ads without what it considered sufficient consent. European digital rules protecting customers leave room for more.

In addition to the fines levied to date, the Irish regulator has another 11 inquiries open into Meta’s services. Meta can perhaps avoid these and appeals could reduce fines. But other claims are close behind. In December, the European Commission said, preliminarily, that the company breached European antitrust rules in tying its classified ad service to its Facebook social network.

Worse, Europe’s Digital Markets Act is gradually entering into force. The new rules offer dos and don’ts for firms like Meta that dominate industries in a way that make it far more painful for firms that do things like prefer their own offerings. With the recalcitrant facing fines up to 20% of revenue, and even possible breakup, future cuts could leave far more blood on the floor. (By Robert Cyran)

March 6 (Reuters) - Brazilian digital lender Nubank said on Monday it had expanded its board to add David Marcus, former digital wallet executive at Meta Platforms Inc (META.O).

Marcus, 49, who headed payments and cryptocurrency operations at Meta, left the social media company at the end of 2021 to launch a crypto-focused startup, Lightspark.

Prior to Meta, he was the president at digital payments company PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) for more than two years.

Nubank is one of the most popular financial technology platforms in Latin America, with around 75 million customers across Brazil, Mexico and Colombia.

Summary Related documents Blockchain nonprofit Dfinity said Meta's new logo would cause confusion

Court disagrees, citing design differences, customer base















(Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc on Thursday beat back a trademark lawsuit by blockchain nonprofit Dfinity Foundation, which had accused the company formerly known as Facebook of ripping off its infinity-symbol logo.

A San Francisco federal court dismissed Dfinity's case, finding Meta's logo was not likely to cause consumer confusion with Dfinity's logo given differences in their designs and target audiences.

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer gave Dfinity permission to amend its lawsuit. Representatives for Meta and Dfinity did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the ruling.

Switzerland-based Dfinity's Internet Computer is an ""infinite"" public blockchain network designed to host smart contracts. It owns federal trademarks for two infinity-symbol logos: one for a ""rainbow"" logo with several colors and another for a logo with its name underneath in no particular color.

Facebook Inc rebranded as Meta last October to reflect its new focus on the virtual-reality metaverse. Meta has described its new logo as a ""continuous loop"" that resembles both the letter 'M' and an infinity sign to symbolize ""infinite horizons in the metaverse.""

Dfinity sued Meta for trademark infringement in May, arguing the tech giant's logo was confusingly similar to its own. It also said that a Meta executive in an internal memo outlined plans for the company to integrate blockchain technologies into its business, which would add to the likelihood of consumer confusion.

Breyer said Thursday that Dfinity had not shown it had actually used its uncolored logo in commerce and said its rainbow logo was not similar enough to Meta's to sustain the lawsuit.

The shape of Meta's logo is different from Dfinity's traditional infinity sign, and Meta's logo is most often blue, unlike Dfinity's multicolored trademark, Breyer said.

Breyer also noted that Dfinity's users are ""tech-savvy developers.""

""That these sophisticated people, immersed in the intricacies of the tech world, would be duped by a logo, particularly one that is not similar in key respects, borders on implausible,"" Breyer said.

Meta is still facing other trademark lawsuits from virtual-reality company MetaX and investment firm Metacapital over its name change.

The case is Dfinity Foundation v. Meta Platforms Inc, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 3:22-cv-02632.

Law firms Related documents Meta loses early bid to dismiss artist's copyright claims

Judge said Facebook may not have removed content quickly enough















(Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc lost a bid to dismiss a lawsuit in Northern California federal court brought by an artist who said Facebook violates her and other creators' copyrights by allowing counterfeit ads on the platform.

Meta did not show that it was entitled to safe harbor from sculptor JL Cook's claims under federal copyright law and could be liable for copyright infringement, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said in a Wednesday ruling.

Cook's attorney Brian Gudmundson of Zimmerman Reed said Thursday that they were looking forward to entering the discovery phase of the case to learn more about ""what is going on at Facebook that is causing this to happen to artists and creators across the country.""

Representatives for Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.

Cook specializes in art depicting snakes and other reptiles. She told the court that counterfeiters have copied and reposted photos of her work in Facebook ads, leading to customers buying knockoffs.

Cook filed a proposed class-action lawsuit against Meta last April for enabling the ads and allegedly failing to respond to her copyright-infringement notices.

Meta told the court in June that the platform was shielded by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act because it responded promptly to the notices, and that it was not responsible for the alleged infringement.

Rogers said Wednesday that Meta had not shown it was immune from the claims under the DMCA. She said Meta may not have acted quickly enough for protection under the law, noting Cook's allegations that the company did not respond to her DMCA notices and did not remove the content until she reached out directly to Facebook's intellectual property counsel.

Rogers also said Meta could be liable for direct copyright infringement for allegedly targeting the ads to Facebook users, and contributory or vicarious infringement for failing to remove them.

The court dismissed some of Cook's other claims, including an allegation that Meta's ads violate federal trademark law. Rogers allowed Cook to amend the claim but said she was ""skeptical"" that it could succeed.

The case is Cook v. Meta Platforms Inc, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 4:22-cv-02485.

(Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and blockchain nonprofit Dfinity Foundation have resolved Dfinity's trademark lawsuit against Meta over its infinity-symbol logo, according to a joint filing in San Francisco federal court.

Meta and Dfinity asked the court Monday to dismiss the case with prejudice, which means it cannot be revived.

A Meta spokesperson said Tuesday that the company was ""pleased with the outcome of the case."" It said Dfinity had dropped the lawsuit after Meta ""pointed out the defects"" in its revised complaint.

Representatives for Dfinity did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Switzerland-based Dfinity's Internet Computer is an ""infinite"" public blockchain network designed to host smart contracts. Dfinity sued Meta last year, alleging the logo Meta adopted after changing its name from Facebook would cause confusion with Dfinity's infinity-symbol trademarks.

6,META,2022-12-19,EU warns Meta over Facebook Marketplace antitrust breach,"













BRUSSELS, Dec 19 (Reuters) - The European Commission on Monday said it has warned Facebook parent company Meta (META.O) that it is breaching EU antitrust laws by distorting competition in markets for online classified advertising and abusing its dominant position.

The Commission said in a preliminary view that it would further investigate and that it could impose a fine of up to 10% of the company's annual global turnover, if there is sufficient evidence of an infringement of European Union rules.

European Union's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement that she is concerned that Meta ties its dominant social network Facebook to its online classified ad services, which is called Facebook Marketplace.

""This means Facebook users have no choice but to have access to Facebook Marketplace,"" she said.

Meta denied its business practices were anti-competitive.

""The claims made by the European Commission are without foundation,"" Meta spokesperson Tim Lamb said in a statement.

""We will continue to work with regulatory authorities to demonstrate that our product innovation is pro-consumer and pro-competitive,"" Lamb added.

The Commission said that besides tying its online classified ads service to its social network, Meta was also abusing its dominant position by unilaterally imposing unfair trading conditions on competing online classified ads services which advertise on Facebook or Instagram.

It said it was concerned the terms and conditions - which authorise Meta to use ads-related data derived from competitors for the benefit of Facebook Marketplace - are unjustified, disproportionate and not necessary for the provision of online display advertising services on Meta's platforms.

Facebook Marketplace was launched in 2016 and is used in 70 countries to buy and sell items.

Sources familiar with the matter last month told Reuters the EU antitrust regulators were drawing up charges against Meta over its use of customer data and the tying of its classified advertisements service to its social network.

The Commission said on Monday that it was concerned that Meta is imposing ""unfair trading conditions"" on competitors of its own classified ads service, Facebook Marketplace, that want to advertise on its social networks Facebook or Instagram.

The EU competition enforcer launched an investigation into Facebook in June last year, focusing on whether the social network unfairly uses advertisers' data to compete with them in the online classified ads sector.

In a separate statement on Monday, the Commission also said it had closed its antitrust investigation into Google and Meta for online display advertising services, adding that ""a careful assessment of evidence did not confirm its initial concerns"".

On March 11, the Commission had opened an investigation to assess whether Google and Meta agreed to weaken and exclude a competing technology to Google's Open Bidding from the market for displaying ads on publisher websites and apps, in breach of EU antitrust rules.

7,META,2022-07-07,Facebook owner Meta announces new virtual reality login system,"













July 7 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) is modifying how users log onto its virtual reality headsets, backtracking on an earlier change to require accounts from the company's flagship Facebook app on the devices while preserving links to social connections there.

The company will roll out its new ""Meta accounts"" starting in August, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post on Thursday.

The social media giant announced plans to remove the Facebook login requirement last year, after a backlash from users who had previously accessed the headsets using separate accounts from Oculus, the virtual reality company that Meta, then known as Facebook, acquired in 2014.

With the new login structure, Meta accounts will control device-level access and manage app purchases, while Meta Horizon profiles will represent the users' social presence in virtual reality, with associated user names and avatars, the company said in a blog post.

People will also have the option to connect their profiles in a unified Meta Accounts Center, which will integrate existing social connections from Facebook, Instagram or Messenger into their virtual reality experiences, it said.

For accounts not added to the Accounts Center, the company will only combine user data across apps for counting users and enforcing safety rules, a spokesperson told Reuters.

In a memo last week, product chief Chris Cox alluded to the change, which he referred to as Project Simile and said would ""power continuity across the metaverse,"" according to a copy of the post viewed by Reuters.

Meta has been pushing to integrate accounts and other products across its ""family of apps,"" which gives users cross-app functionality while enabling the company to consolidate data about their behavior in different environments.

The company announced plans to unify its messaging structure across apps in 2019 and later that year rolled out a payment service, now called Meta Pay, through which users can process transactions across Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp.

BERLIN, May 4 (Reuters) - Germany's cartel office said that Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O), the owner of Facebook, has ""paramount significance for competition across markets"", a classification which gives the regulator more leeway to curb digital companies' market power.

Under legislation introduced by German lawmakers in early 2021, the cartel office can ban what it deems to be anti-competitive activities.

Meta, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, operates a strong, ad-supported social media ecosystem that continues to expand and is used by a large portion of the population in Germany, the cartel office said in a statement on Wednesday.

It said the new classification would form the basis for a more rapid conclusion of ongoing antitrust proceedings against Meta.

In 2019, the cartel office ordered the company to curb its data collection, saying the world's largest social network had abused its market dominance to harvest the information of its users without their consent. Meta, then called Facebook, appealed the decision, and the matter is still pending in court.

The cartel office also initiated abuse proceedings against Meta in 2020 related to the links between its Oculus virtual reality products and the social media network.

A spokesperson for Meta said on Wednesday that the U.S.-based company would comply with the cartel office's decision on the classification.

""Even if we do not share the reasoning that has led to the Federal Cartel Office's decision, we will continue to concentrate on providing our users in Germany with the best possible experience in keeping with all the laws and regulations,"" a spokesperson for Meta told Reuters.

9,META,2022-04-27,Meta shares surge after Facebook ekes out user growth,"













April 27 (Reuters) - Facebook rebounded from a drop in users early this year and its parent Meta (FB.O) posted a profit ahead of Wall Street targets, defying low investor expectations with a quarterly report that sent shares up 20%.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also said that the company would scale back costs and was investing in artificial intelligence tools to improve recommendations and ads, a sign Meta is buckling down to make money while working on its long-term ambitions to build the metaverse.

Its stock rose 19% in after-hours trade on Wednesday.

Meta's profit soundly beat Wall Street targets at $2.72 per share, compared with an average analyst estimate of $2.56, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The earning beats were tempered by Meta recording its slowest revenue growth in a decade.

Facebook daily active users (DAU), a key metric for advertisers, were 1.96 billion, slightly higher than the estimate of 1.95 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Monthly active users came in at 2.94 billion, missing Wall Street estimates by 30 million.

Meta has lost about half of its value since the start of the year, after a dismal February earnings report when Facebook's daily active users declined for the first time and it forecast a gloomy quarter, blaming ongoing factors including Apple's (AAPL.O) privacy changes and increased competition from platforms like ByteDance's TikTok. read more

""It's good news that Meta somehow managed to eke out growth in DAU. It needed to show some sort of turnaround from last quarter's performance,"" Insider Intelligence analyst Debra Williamson said.

""However, growth in monthly active users is slowing quickly. A few quarters ago it could count on developing markets to keep the growth engine going but it's likely that even these high-growth opportunities are starting to dry up,"" she said.

Total revenue, the bulk of which comes from ad sales, rose 7% to $27.91 billion in the first quarter, but missed analysts' estimates of $28.20 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

In a conference call with analysts on Wednesday, Chief Financial Officer Dave Wehner cited factors including a slowdown in ecommerce after rapid growth during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a loss of revenue in Russia and reduced ad demand amid global economic uncertainty. On the call, Zuckerberg also echoed previous warnings about the challenges of engagement shifting toward features like its short video offering Reels, which generates less revenue than other ad formats.

Russia banned Facebook and Instagram in March, finding Meta guilty of ""extremist activity"" amid Moscow's crackdown on social media during its invasion of Ukraine. Meta's messaging service WhatsApp is not affected by the ban. Meta has also barred advertisers in Russia from creating and running ads anywhere in the world. read more

Meta forecast second-quarter revenue between $28 billion and $30 billion. Analysts on average were expecting current-quarter revenue of $30.63 billion. The company said its outlook reflected factors including the war in Ukraine and said it was monitoring the potential impact of regulatory moves in Europe.

Recent earnings reports from Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Snap Inc (SNAP.N) have signaled the impact of the global economic turmoil on digital ads spending, amid rising inflation and geopolitical uncertainty. read more

""I think following Google, expectations were just for the absolute worst,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. ""When they came in with EPS above estimates, I think people who had shorted the stock and those that had...given up on it decided to come back in.""

Meta lowered its expected 2022 total expenses to between $87 billion and $92 billion, down from its prior outlook of $90 billion to $95 billion.

Company executives said on the call that Meta was making significant investments in AI and machine learning to improve ad capabilities, as it grapples with the impact of Apple's changes to its operating system, which have made it harder for brands to target and measure their ads on Facebook and Instagram.

But Zuckerberg also said that due to current business growth levels, Meta was slowing the pace of some longer-term investments in its AI infrastructure and Reality Labs hardware division, which is home to its augmented and virtual reality efforts

Meta saw quarterly revenue of $695 million for Reality Labs hardware division. It reported $3 billion in losses from operations from these metaverse ambitions.

Zuckerberg has warned it will take Meta billions of dollars and multiple years to realize its aims around building the metaverse, a futuristic idea of virtual environments where users can work, socialize and play.

Jan 25 (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Donald Trump's potential return to Meta Platform's (META.O) Facebook and Instagram is unlikely to change how advertisers spend money with the world's second-largest digital ad company, ad agency executives said.

This is good news for Meta whose stock has halved over the past year amid a slowdown in ad spending as brands cut their marketing budgets in response to historic inflation.

In a blog post on Wednesday announcing Trump's reinstatement, Meta said he will face ""heightened penalties for repeat offenses."" The company, then called Facebook, banned Trump two years ago after he praised rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

While Meta's closely watched deliberation on whether to reinstate Trump was polarizing, ad buyers said the platform's broad reach of 3.7 billion users is too important for many businesses.

""Polarizing characters are on all platforms. It's a moot point when brands need to drive sales and sign-ups,"" said Darren D'Altorio, head of social at ad agency Wpromote that works with brands such as Whirlpool and TransUnion.

Trump's reinstatement, however, reinforces long-standing concerns about how social media platforms can ensure that ads don't appear next to content that marketers consider unsuitable, D'Altorio said.

Civil rights groups including the NAACP and GLAAD blasted Meta's decision on Wednesday.

In July 2020, thousands of advertisers boycotted Facebook as part of a rights campaign to pressure the platform to do more to prevent hate speech but the boycott had little effect on the company's revenue.

Trump's influence has waned since leaving office, and may be one reason why clients have not inquired about the impact of his return on their ads, said Erica Patrick, senior vice president of paid social media at IPG's (IPG.N) Mediahub, which has worked with Netflix (NFLX.O) and Western Union (WU.N).

In November, new Twitter owner Elon Musk lifted the platform's permanent ban on Trump.

Many of Twitter's top advertisers paused their spending after Musk took over Twitter and swiftly fired thousands of employees and oversaw a botched verification feature that allowed scammers to impersonate publicly listed companies.

Ad spending on Twitter slumped in the last two months of 2022, according to Standard Media Index, which measures ad spending based on data from ad agencies.

Yvonne Williams, vice president of media at Code3, which counts Tiffany & Co among its clients, said brands would be watching closely to see how Meta will ""monitor (Trump) and keep to the rules they have in place.""

11,META,2023-03-10,Meta exploring plans for Twitter rival,"













March 10 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) is exploring plans to launch a new social media app in its bid to displace Twitter as the world's ""digital town square"".

""We're exploring a standalone decentralized social network for sharing text updates. We believe there's an opportunity for a separate space where creators and public figures can share timely updates about their interests,"" a Meta spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement.

Meta's app will be based on a similar framework that powers Mastodon, a Twitter-like service that was launched in 2016.

A Twitter-like app would allow Meta to take advantage of the current chaos at the Elon Musk-led company, where cost-cutting has been rampant.

Twitter has been struggling to hold on to its advertising base since Musk's takeover of the platform late last year. Companies have pulled back spending following Twitter's move to restore suspended accounts and release a paid account verification that resulted in scammers impersonating firms.

Meta's plans come at a time when its biggest platform, Facebook, is struggling to attract the attention of a younger audience, while its huge investments in the metaverse, a virtual world where users interact and work, show little signs of paying off, at least in the near term.

Its video-sharing app, Instagram, is also facing stiff competition as content makers or hit influencers abandon the platform for TikTok.

It was not immediately clear when Meta would roll out the new app.

""The history of Meta is that they are much better acquirers than they are innovators or developers ... as far as copying Twitter, this is just a defensive move,"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member of New York-based Great Hill Capital.

""They're just trying everything... at least with a mini blogging site like Twitter, there's some expectation that it could start to make money out of much quicker timeline than the metaverse investment.""

Meta's investments in the metaverse will not drive revenue growth until 2030, analysts have said.

Meta shares were marginally higher at $181.7 in early trade on Friday. They have gained about 51% so far this year.

12,META,2022-12-15,Meta halts construction of two data centres in Denmark,"













COPENHAGEN, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) has halted construction of two data centres in Odense, Denmark, and will instead focus on a new type of data centre used for artificial intelligence (AI), a spokesperson said on Thursday.

Facebook-owner Meta already has two large data centres in Odense, but only one of the three other centres currently under development there will be completed.

""Over the past month, we have announced a number of measures to make us a more streamlined organisation,"" Meta spokesperson Peter Münster told Reuters.

""A significant part of these measures is to shift a larger part of our resources to high-priority growth areas, including a strategic investment in artificial intelligence,"" he said.

Last month, Meta said it would cut 11,000 jobs, the first in the company's 18-year history, after disappointing results in several quarters.

The company's traditional data centres house servers for apps such as Facebook and Instagram. But the calculations needed for AI require a new generation of data centres, Münster said.

Construction on the two halted data centres in Odense began in August. However, on Tuesday Meta terminated the deal with contracting company Per Aarsleff (PAALb.CO) worth 2.4 billion Danish crowns ($344 million).

March 17 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) on Friday launched its subscription service in the U.S., which would allow Facebook and Instagram users pay for verification in the same vein as Elon Musk-owned Twitter.

The Meta Verified service will give users a blue badge after they verify their accounts using a government ID and will cost $11.99 per month on the web or $14.99 a month on Apple's iOS system and Google-owned Android, Meta said in a statement.

The service, which Meta said it was testing in February, follows in the footsteps of Snap Inc-owned (SNAP.N) Snapchat as well as messaging app Telegram and marks the latest effort by a social media company to diversify its revenue away from advertising.

After a $44 billion buyout by Musk last year, Twitter had rolled out its Blue subscription service which lets people pay for the blue check mark previously limited to verified accounts of politicians, journalists and other public figures.

The initial launch of Twitter Blue in November had led to a surge in users impersonating celebrities and brands on the platform, which prompted the company to halt the service and reintroduce it with different colored checks for individuals, companies and governments.

14,META,2023-03-03,Meta lowers Quest VR headsets prices to lure customers,"













March 3 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) cut the prices of its virtual reality headsets in hopes of stirring demand for its VR hardware, as its bold bets on the metaverse have struggled to make a big splash.

Its flagship Meta Quest Pro will retail for $999, down from its launch price of $1,499, and Quest 2 256 GB version for $429 from $499, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a broadcast on its social media platform Instagram on Friday.

The company called out lower Quest 2 sales as the reason behind a 17% drop in fourth-quarter revenue at its Reality Labs unit, which includes VR-related offerings.

The division lost $13.7 billion last year and over $10 billion in 2021.

Meta is facing heat from investors for pouring money into metaverse that has not reaped benefits as expected.

Late last year, the company launched Quest Pro, positioning it as its most-advanced VR headset with capabilities to push the use-cases further.

Quest Pro, with its outward-facing cameras that capture 3D livestream of the physical environment and allow novelties like the ability to hang virtual paintings on a real-world wall, was aimed at designers, architects and other creative professionals.

Meta has of late sobered its stand on the metaverse and is focusing on saving costs. The company called 2023 as the ""Year of Efficiency"" and projected billions in cuts to its spends this year.

While VR headsets have added more advanced capabilities of late, their adoption outside of the gaming community has been slow.

Last month, Tencent, the world's largest video game publisher, shelved plans to venture into VR hardware, while it has been in talks to distribute Meta Quest line of products in China.

NEW DELHI, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms (META.O) appointed Sandhya Devanathan as its India head on Thursday, days after Ajit Mohan quit to join rival Snap Inc (SNAP.N).

WhatsApp's India head Abhijit Bose and Meta Platforms's public policy director in India Rajiv Aggarwal also resigned earlier this week.

Devanathan's appointment comes at a time when Facebook is facing regulatory challenges in India with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration tightening laws governing Big Tech companies.

The company has for years faced criticism for doing little to curb the spread of fake news and hate speech in India.

Devanathan has been with Meta since 2016 and will move into her new role in January.

Feb 9 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) has restored former U.S. President Donald Trump's access to Facebook and Instagram, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone confirmed on Thursday, following a two-year suspension after the deadly Capitol Hill riot on Jan. 6, 2021.

Meta in January said it would lift Trump's suspension ""in the coming weeks"" and would institute heightened penalties of a suspension between one month and two years if the former president violated its content policies again.

Trump now regains access to key platforms for voter outreach and political fundraising ahead of another run for the White House in 2024. He had 23 million followers on Instagram and 34 million on Facebook as of January.

Feb 13 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms (META.O) said on Monday Chief Business Officer Marne Levine was leaving the owner of Facebook after a 13-year stint.

Fifty-two-year-old Levine, appointed as the company's first chief business officer in 2021, has served in various other executive positions at the social media company, including chief operating officer of Instagram.

The company said it expanded Nicola Mendelsohn's role as head of global business group and named Justin Osofsky as head of online sales, operations and partnerships, in the wake of Levine's imminent departure.

Mendelsohn will handle the company’s relationships with top marketers and agencies for all of its apps, while Osofsky will be leading sales and operations focused on growing small- and medium-sized businesses on Meta's platforms.

The changes come at a time when Meta has promised to cut costs by $5 billion in the year to a range of $89 billion to $95 billion, calling 2023 the ""Year of Efficiency"".

20,META,2022-07-27,"Meta Platforms, like wine, gets better with age","













NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Maturity isn’t such a bad thing for Meta Platforms . Sure, advertising at the $430 billion social media platform is under threat, and user growth is slowing, while the Facebook parent’s new virtual world looks a little like a corporate mid-life crisis. But the business is showing the benefits of age, like decent profitability. Through a new set of bifocals, it might even look undervalued.

That’s probably hard for investors to accept given Facebook was growing like a weed, and now isn’t. Revenue jumped more than 60% between 2019 and 2021, but on Wednesday Meta said that total revenue in the second quarter actually fell 1% compared to the same quarter last year, and that third-quarter revenue is likely to be flat at best. Meta depends on selling advertising for its revenue, and the average ad price fell 14%.

How users engage is a concern too. Facebook only had 1% more active users in the quarter ending June than it did a year earlier, and lost a few from the preceding quarter. Still, some signs suggest Meta is standing the test of time. Though the average minutes spent on its apps are declining, Facebook and Meta-owned sibling Instagram are second and third in engagement behind newer TikTok, according to research from Cowen.

Having been around the block, Meta at least knows how to turn a profit. Its EBITDA margin is expected to be 40% this year, according to Refinitiv, far better than Twitter (TWTR.N), which is about half that, and even higher than Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O).

That profitability deserves more credit. Even if Facebook’s top line were to fall 20% but margins stayed the same, investors would only have to honor Meta with an enterprise value of 8.5 times EBITDA to justify its current enterprise value of $387 billion. That’s far less than the 10 times the market awards Google read more , and a quarter of where Twitter is valued.

Of course, that depends in large part on Zuckerberg controlling his spending on new ventures. Research and development costs jumped in the second quarter, taking down the company’s margins. A firmer grip on exercises like the metaverse might mean less growth for a while. But maybe Meta is like a fine wine in two ways: It gets better with age, and appreciating it requires a discerning palate.

Meta Platforms on July 27 reported second-quarter revenue of $29 billion, a 1% decline from the same quarter the previous year. The company had 2.9 million monthly active users, an increase of 1% year-over-year, but a slight decrease from the previous quarter.

NEW YORK, Feb 15 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Video-game and social-media hub Roblox (RBLX.N) isn’t playing around when it comes to expanding its audience. The company behind MeepCity and Royale High has been racing alongside Meta Platforms (META.O) to turn the metaverse into more than just a vague buzzword. Despite being unprofitable and considerably smaller than Facebook’s owner, it is putting up a solid fight.

Roblox shares surged another 25% on Wednesday, adding $5 billion of market value – roughly the same amount Meta lost in a broadly flat market – after it reported that quarterly in-game purchases using its virtual Robux currency grew 17%, to $899 million. The company ended January with 65 million daily active users. Chief Financial Officer Michael Guthrie noted that growth was particularly strong among those older than 17, after telling investors a couple years ago it was targeting anyone from 6 to 60.

Despite spending more than five times as much as Roblox did last year developing a virtual universe, Meta’s Horizon Worlds has fewer than 1 million monthly active users, according to the Wall Street Journal. Meta is mulling ways to attract younger users, including maybe opening the game up to minors older than 13. It’s becoming clearer, however, that the battle will be on more than one generational front. (By Anita Ramaswamy)

Companies Law firms EBay's Quinn Emanuel lawyers ask court to quash Meta bid for deposition

Latest pretrial flashpoint as Meta seeks info to fight FTC















March 14 (Reuters) - E-commerce platform eBay Inc (EBAY.O) on Monday asked a U.S. judge to block a bid by Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) for testimony from an eBay corporate official as the social media giant seeks rivals' information to counter a Federal Trade Commission antitrust lawsuit.

EBay's lawyers from Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan said in a filing in San Francisco federal court that Meta is demanding confidential business information about eBay's privacy policies, data retention and other topics that are not relevant to the FTC's monopoly claims.

The subpoena fight is the latest flashpoint in Meta's campaign to squeeze information from other technology and social media companies in advance of a possible trial next year against the FTC.

Meta has faced some resistance from other companies that said its demands for information were too broad or invasive. In November, a judge ruled Sequoia Capital could not quash subpoenas from Meta seeking information about how the venture capital firm analyzed the photo-sharing site Instagram and the messaging service WhatsApp before Meta bought them.

""Meta's discovery gluttony confirms its request of eBay is not worthy of the burden Meta seeks to impose,"" eBay's lawyers told the California court. ""The breadth of the subpoena,"" they said, ""is alarming.""

A Meta spokesperson said in a statement that the company is ""seeking information from companies with which we compete or which we believe have information relating to the FTC's claims.""

The FTC sued Meta in D.C. federal court in 2020, accusing the company of abusing its power in the ""personal social networking services"" market. The lawsuit seeks to force Meta to sell the photo-sharing app Instagram and messaging platform WhatsApp.

Meta has denied the FTC's antitrust allegations. Among other defenses, it disputes the FTC's asserted ""personal social networking services"" market.

EBay's Quinn Emanuel attorneys derided Meta as a ""litigant that has completely disregarded the bounds of reason and proportionality"" in seeking information from third parties.

A representative from eBay and its attorneys at Quinn Emanuel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The FTC declined to comment.

Lawyers for eBay contend the company doesn't compete with Meta on social networking but does face off over the Facebook Marketplace e-commerce service.

EBay said it has already disclosed nearly 2,500 pages of internal records to Meta.

But the company said it ""should not be forced to divulge further confidential information to a competitor absent a clear showing the information will be relevant and necessary, which is not the case here.""

The case is Federal Trade Commission v. Meta Platforms Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 3:23-mc-80074.

Law firms Related documents Court rejects allegations that content-posting function violates copyrights

Judge gives photographer permission to file new complaint















(Reuters) - A Meta Platforms Inc feature that allows users to embed Facebook content on other websites does not violate photographers' copyrights, a San Francisco federal judge said Tuesday.

Photographer Don Logan's proposed class action lawsuit failed because he did not allege that any websites saved his photos onto their servers without permission, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said.

Breyer dismissed a similar class action copyright case against Meta's Instagram last year based on the 9th Circuit's divisive ""server test,"" under which a website can only violate a copyright owner's exclusive right to display their works if it also stores copies of the works on its servers.

Breyer gave Logan permission to amend his complaint. His attorney Lee Squitieri of Squitieri & Fearon said in an email that he plans to refile the lawsuit and believes he can ""cure all of the flaws noted by the court.""

Representatives for Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Logan filed the lawsuit in February on behalf of a group of photographers whose pictures were allegedly embedded from Facebook onto third-party websites, or from other websites onto Facebook, without their permission.

But Breyer said Monday that Logan did not allege that the websites stored copies of the pictures, and therefore failed to argue the copies were fixed in a ""tangible medium of expression"" as required by copyright law.

Breyer also rejected Logan's claims that Facebook misused pictures from other websites because he had not shown that those pictures were registered with the U.S. Copyright Office. However, the judge also said that Logan may be able to show that Meta saved some of the photos to its servers.

Breyer also dismissed Logan's related false advertising allegations that Meta misrepresented the ""creation and ownership"" of his photos.

The case is Logan v. Meta Platforms Inc, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 3:22-cv-01847.

$60 million lawsuit follows others filed since Facebook adopted new Meta name, logo















(Reuters) - Investment firm Metacapital Management LP sued Meta Platforms Inc in Manhattan federal court on Wednesday, alleging the Facebook parent company's use of the Meta name to provide financial services would cause customer confusion and violate its trademarks.

Metacapital asked the court for damages of at least $60 million, the same amount Meta Platforms paid last year to acquire the trademark assets of Meta Financial Group, a regional bank.

""Given that Facebook was aware of Meta Financial Group and its purported rights (which post-date Metacapital's priority by at least two years), it is not credible that Facebook was also not aware of Metacapital,"" the lawsuit said.

Metacapital's lead attorney Anthony Dreyer of Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom said Wednesday that Meta Platforms ""has caused and will continue to cause irreparable harm to Metacapital.""

Meta Platforms did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

New York-based Metacapital said in the lawsuit that it has been using its name since it was founded in 2001, and received related federal trademarks starting in 2002. The firm said its clients have included major financial institutions like CitiBank, Barclays and J.P. Morgan.

Meta Platforms rebranded from Facebook in October 2021 to reflect its focus on the metaverse, a shared virtual realm. It applied to register Meta-related trademarks in January related to a range of financial services, including ""investment management services.""

Meta Platforms also announced earlier this year that it would change the name of its financial-services unit from Novi to Meta Financial Technologies, which Metacapital said was likely to further confuse its potential customers.

The lawsuit said Metacapital sent Meta Platforms a cease-and-desist letter in May, and that the companies have been unable to resolve the dispute outside of court.

Virtual-reality company MetaX LLC separately sued Meta Platforms over its name in July. Blockchain developer Dfinity sued in May, alleging Meta Platforms' new infinity-symbol logo would cause confusion with its own.

PARIS, June 16 (Reuters) - France's anti-trust watchdog body said on Thursday that it had approved commitments made by Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O) regarding the French online advertising sector.

Meta has committed to giving access over a five-year period to advertising inventories and campaign data to so-called advertising technology companies on transparent, objective and predictable conditions, the French regulator said.

""It's the first time Meta makes commitments to a competition authority (over the ad sector),"" said the French competition authority's vice-chairman Henri Piffaut.

Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The antitrust decision follows a complaint by French online advertising group Criteo (CRTO.O).

Meta provides access to the advertising data through Meta Business Partner and it has committed that ad tech companies can access it when a level of spending is met on its interface.

The commitments made by Meta are applicable for ad inventories on all Meta's platforms, including Facebook and Instagram, the watchdog said.

The commitments also apply to ad tech companies that participated in at least one ad campaign seen by Meta's users in France, the authority said.

Ad tech companies exploit data collected online to participate in online ad campaigns, aiming to target Internet users with messages that fit their tastes.

The antitrust authority's general aim is to offer non-discriminatory market conditions to the growing number of companies that have emerged in the online sector.

""You can develop an ecosystem but it shouldn't exclude a competitor,"" Piffaut said.

In May, Germany's cartel office had said Meta Platforms Inc had ""paramount significance for competition across markets"", marking a classification which gave Germany more leeway to curb digital companies' market power. read more

BRUSSELS, Nov 9 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are drawing up charges against Facebook parent Meta (META.O) over its use of customer data and the tying of its classified advertisements service to its social network, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named.

The European Commission, which can impose fines up to 10% of a company's global turnover for antitrust violations and Meta declined to comment.

The Commission began an investigation into the social network company in June last year. Britain's competition agency also began an enquiry on the same day.

In recent months, the Commission has asked Meta rivals to remove confidential information from their submissions to the regulator. Typically, that is the precursor to the Commission sending companies under investigation a statement of objections detailing what it sees as anti-competitive practices.

Meta's classified ads business called Facebook Marketplace was launched in 2016 and is used in 70 countries to buy and sell items.

Politico was the first to report a statement of objections is imminent.

July 14 (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta (META.O) released its first annual human rights report on Thursday, following years of accusations that it turned a blind eye to online abuses that fueled real-world violence in places like India and Myanmar.

The report, which covers due diligence performed in 2020 and 2021, includes a summary of a controversial human rights impact assessment of India that Meta commissioned law firm Foley Hoag to conduct.

Human rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have demanded the release of the India assessment in full, accusing Meta of stalling in a joint letter sent in January. read more

In its summary, Meta said the law firm had noted the potential for ""salient human rights risks"" involving Meta's platforms, including ""advocacy of hatred that incites hostility, discrimination, or violence.""

The assessment, it added, did not probe ""accusations of bias in content moderation.""

Ratik Asokan, a representative from India Civil Watch International who participated in the assessment and later organized the joint letter, told Reuters the summary struck him as an attempt by Meta to ""whitewash"" the firm's findings.

""It's as clear evidence as you can get that they're very uncomfortable with the information that's in that report,"" he said. ""At least show the courage to release the executive summary so we can see what the independent law firm has said.""

Human Rights Watch researcher Deborah Brown likewise called the summary ""selective"" and said it ""brings us no closer"" to understanding the company's role in the spread of hate speech in India or commitments it will make to address the issue.

Rights groups for years have raised alarms about anti-Muslim hate speech stoking tensions in India, Meta's largest market globally by number of users.

Meta's top public policy executive in India stepped down in 2020 following a Wall Street Journal report that she opposed applying the company's rules to Hindu nationalist figures flagged internally for promoting violence.

In its report, Meta said it was studying the India recommendations, but did not commit to implementing them as it did with other rights assessments.

Asked about the difference, Meta Human Rights Director Miranda Sissons pointed to United Nations guidelines cautioning against risks to ""affected stakeholders, personnel or to legitimate requirements of commercial confidentiality.""

""The format of the reporting can be influenced by a variety of factors, including security reasons,"" Sissons told Reuters.

Sissons, who joined Meta in 2019, said her team is now comprised of eight people, while about 100 others work on human rights with related teams.

In addition to country-level assessments, the report outlined her team's work on Meta's COVID-19 response and Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses, which involved flagging possible privacy risks and effects on vulnerable groups.

Sissons said analysis of augmented and virtual reality technologies, which Meta has prioritized with its bet on the ""metaverse,"" is largely taking place this year and would be discussed in subsequent reports.

28,META,2022-11-23,German regulator stays vigilant as Meta changes VR headset rules,"













BERLIN, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Facebook's parent company Meta Platforms (META.O) has responded to the German cartel office's concerns by allowing the use of its virtual reality headset without a Facebook account, the office said on Wednesday.

The cartel office has been closely watching Meta since May when it declared it was of ""paramount significance for competition across markets"", a classification that gives the regulator more scope to curb digital companies' market power.

In a statement on Wednesday, Germany's cartel office said Meta will allow the device to be used with a separate Meta account, clearing the path for it to begin selling the Quest 2 headset in Germany. This also applies to the new Quest Pro model, it added.

Meta did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment.

Cartel office chief Andreas Mundt pointed to Meta's strong position in social media as well as the growing VR market.

""If the use of VR headsets were only possible for Facebook or Instagram members, this could severely affect competition in both areas,"" he said.

Despite the headset being made available to others via the Meta account, the German regulator said it would continue to monitor the design of user choices and issues relating to the aggregation and processing of user data from Meta services.

Summary

Summary Companies Meta to appeal ruling, says personalised ads unaffected

Meta fines under new EU data regime rise to 1.3 bln eur

Irish privacy watchdog is Meta's lead regulator in EU















DUBLIN, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Meta (META.O) must reassess the legal basis on how Facebook and Instagram use personal data to target advertising in the European Union, its lead privacy regulator in the bloc said on Wednesday when it fined the social media giant 390 million euros ($414 million) for the breaches.

Meta said it intended to appeal both the substance of the rulings and the fines imposed, and that the decisions do not prevent personalised advertising on its platforms.

The order on personalised advertising was made in December by the EU's privacy watchdog, according to a decision seen by Reuters, in which it overruled a draft ruling by Ireland's Data Privacy Commissioner (DPC), Meta's lead EU privacy regulator.

It related to a 2018 change in the terms of service at Facebook and Instagram following the introduction of new EU privacy laws where Meta sought to rely on the so-called ""contract"" legal basis for most of its processing operations.

Having previously relied on the consent of users to the processing of their personal data for targeted advertising, the DPC said Meta instead considered that a contract was entered into upon acceptance of the updated 2018 terms and that this made such advertising lawful.

The DPC, which is the lead privacy regulator for many of the world's largest technology companies within the EU, directed Meta to bring its data processing operations into compliance within three months.

Meta said it strongly believes that its approach respects EU privacy laws that allow for a range of legal bases under which data can be processed and that the decisions also do not mandate the use of consent for the processing of data.

""We want to reassure users and businesses that they can continue to benefit from personalised advertising across the EU through Meta's platforms,"" Meta said in a statement.

The penalties brought the total fines levied against Meta to date by the Irish regulator to 1.3 billion euros. It currently has 11 other inquiries open into Meta services.

The DPC said that as part of its decision, the EU's privacy watchdog had purported to direct the Irish regulator to conduct a fresh investigation that would span all of Facebook and Instagram's data processing operations.

The DPC said it was not open to the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) to direct an authority to engage in such investigations and that it intended to ask the EU Court of Justice to set aside the EDPB's direction as it may involve an ""overreach"".

30,META,2022-10-20,"Meta, Alphabet, Pinterest shares shudder on Snap warning","













Oct 20 (Reuters) - Shares of Meta Platforms, Google-owner Alphabet and other companies that sell digital ads dropped late on Thursday after Snapchat owner Snap Inc (SNAP.N) blamed inflation for its slowest revenue growth since going public five years ago.

Snap was the first major social media company to release its September-quarter earnings, and its stock tumbled 25% following the disappointing results after the bell. Snap warned that it would see no revenue growth in the normally busy holiday quarter.

Shares of other companies that sell internet advertising also fell, with Facebook-owner Meta (META.O) down about 4%, Alphabet (GOOGL.O) down 2% and Pinterest (PINS.N) losing nearly 8%. All together the sell-off in late trading erased over $40 billion in stock market value from those and other internet ad companies, including Spotify (SPOT.N) and Roku (ROKU.O).

Snap's warning comes after already steep losses in shares of social media companies, with Meta down about 60% year to date, and Pinterest down almost 40%.

Investors worry that the economy could become seriously damaged by the U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes aimed at cooling decades-high inflation.

Social media stocks collapse

Last trading at about $8 a share, Snap's stock has now fallen 90% from its record high close in September 2021. Snap debuted on the stock market in a hotly anticipated initial public offer in 2017 that priced its stock at $17.

In a letter to investors, Snap said inflation caused some advertisers to reduce their marketing budgets.

Revenue for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 was $1.13 billion, an increase of 6% from the prior-year quarter. The figure narrowly missed analyst expectations of $1.14 billion, according to Refinitiv.

The company announced in August it would lay off 20% of all employees and discontinue projects such as gaming and a flying camera drone, in order to cut costs and steel itself against a deteriorating economy.

Alphabet reports its quarterly results on Tuesday, followed by Meta on Wednesday.

31,META,2023-03-06,Meta will keep releasing AI tools despite leak claims,"













March 6 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) on Monday said it will continue to release its artificial intelligence tools to approved researchers despite claims on online message boards that its latest large language model had leaked to unauthorized users.

""While the model is not accessible to all, and some have tried to circumvent the approval process, we believe the current release strategy allows us to balance responsibility and openness,"" Meta said in a statement.

Facebook owner Meta maintains a major AI research arm and last month released LLaMA, short for Large Language Model Meta AI. Meta claimed that the model can achieve the kind of human-like conversational abilities of AI systems designed by ChatGPT creator OpenAI and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) while using far less computing power.

Unlike some rivals such as OpenAI, which keeps tight wraps on its technology and charges software developers to access it, Meta's AI research arm shares most of its work openly. But AI tools also contain the potential for abuse, such as creating and spreading false information.

To avoid those kinds of misuse, Meta makes its tools available to researchers and other entities affiliated with government, civil society and academia under a non-commercial license after a vetting process.

Last week, users on the online forum 4Chan claimed to have made the model available for download. Reuters could not independently verify those claims.

In its statement, Meta said its LLaMA release was handled in the same way as previous models and that it does not plan to change its strategy.

""It’s Meta's goal to share state-of-the-art AI models with members of the research community to help us evaluate and improve those models,"" Meta said.

March 10 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) said on Friday it is exploring strategic alternatives for customer service company Kustomer that it acquired in a process ending last year.

""We are currently exploring strategic alternatives for Kustomer and will continue to support Kustomer's product and customer base throughout this process,"" the Facebook owner said in an emailed statement to Reuters, without providing additional details on the alternatives.

The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news on Friday, said Meta is planning to divest Kustomer as it looks to looks to refocus on its core business, citing the company and people familiar with the planned deal.

Kustomer sells CRM software for businesses to communicate with consumers by phone, email, text messages, WhatsApp, Instagram and other channels. It had seen a usage soar during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Meta has made the decision to focus on its fastest growing business messaging offerings, including the monetization opportunity for WhatsApp in light of the company's ""efficiency efforts,"" the company said.

Sept 29 (Reuters) - Facebook-parent Meta Platforms (META.O) will freeze hiring and further restructure amid an uncertain macroeconomic situation, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, quoting Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's communication with employees.

Several tech companies have been forced to slash headcount in recent months as advertisers trim spending to prepare for a looming recession. read more

""I had hoped the economy would have more clearly stabilized by now, but from what we're seeing it doesn't yet seem like it has, so we want to plan somewhat conservatively,"" Zuckerberg told employees during a weekly Q&A session, Bloomberg News reported.

The social media company had cut plans to hire engineers by at least 30% this year, Reuters reported in June. read more

Zuckerberg also said on Thursday that Meta would reduce budgets across most teams and that individual teams will have to resolve how to handle headcount changes, the report added.

Meta declined to comment on Bloomberg report. The company referred to Zuckerberg's warning of reduction in headcount over the next year in the second-quarter earnings call.

The company had confirmed hiring freezes in broad terms in May, but exact figures have not previously been reported.

34,META,2022-09-02,"Meta, Qualcomm sign pact on custom virtual reality chips","













Sept 2 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) signed an agreement to have chip-maker Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) produce custom chipsets for its Quest virtual reality (VR) devices, the companies announced at a consumer electronics conference in Berlin on Friday.

Engineering and product teams of both companies will work together to produce the chips, powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon platforms, they said in a statement.

The agreement shows the dependency of Meta, known as Facebook until last year, on Qualcomm's technology even as it tries to develop custom silicon of its own for its virtual, augmented and mixed reality devices.

""Unlike mobile phones, building VR brings novel multidimensional challenges in spatial computing, cost and form factor,"" Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a video message.

""We are still in the early stages of the metaverse and this sort of deep technical integration will help VR move towards being a multifunctional computing platform,"" he said.

Meta has been investing heavily in technologies like pass-through goggles and augmented reality glasses as it tries to bring to life Zuckerberg's vision for the metaverse, a concept involving an immersive set of digital worlds.

It has relied on Qualcomm's chips for its VR devices for years, including for its latest Quest2 headset.

The chipsets produced through the collaboration will not be exclusive to Meta, but will be optimized specifically for Quest's system specifications, Meta spokesperson Tyler Yee told Reuters.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

The agreement covers only VR devices, Yee said, and Meta will continue working to develop some of its own silicon solutions.

""There could be situations where we use off-the-shelf silicon or work with industry partners on customizations, while also exploring our own novel silicon solutions. There could also be scenarios where we use both partner and custom solutions in the same product,"" said Yee.

Aug 9 (Reuters) - Facebook-parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) said on Tuesday it had raised $10 billion in its first-ever bond offering, as it looks to fund share buybacks and investments to revamp its business.

The offering would help Meta, the only one among big technology companies without debt on its books, to build a more traditional balance sheet and fund some expensive initiatives, such as its metaverse virtual reality. read more

37,META,2022-10-27,Tech rout widens as Meta sinks after results,"













Oct 27 (Reuters) - A carnage in U.S. technology stocks widened on Thursday as shares of Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) sank 20% after the Facebook parent's costly metaverse bets and the impact of soaring inflation on ad spending spooked investors.

Meta was set to lose about $78 billion in market value, if losses hold to the end of the session, adding to the trillions of dollars that some of the biggest tech names have shed this year amid rising interest rates and a stronger dollar.

Meta has lost more than half a trillion dollars in market value so far this year. Its shares were trading at $100.55, their lowest since February 2016.

The company's results come a day after Google and Microsoft posted dismal numbers, sparking a widespread selloff in technology stocks.

Analysts said investors are worried because Meta is spending on capital-intensive projects at a time when the ad market, a major source of revenue for the company, is drying up.

The company expects to spend about $10 billion a year for metaverse hardware and software, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg saying on Wednesday that he expects those investments to take about a decade to bear fruit. read more

""Meta Horizon Worlds (at present) is a relative ghost town when compared to other 3D immersive worlds like Roblox and Fortnite,"" said Mike Proulx, research director at Forrester.

CHIP BOON

Meta's aggressive spending on the metaverse, however, is likely to be a boon for one segment of the broader technology sector - chipmakers.

Its plans require capital expenditure for new data centers and infrastructure, said Ben Barringer, analyst at Quilter Cheviot.

Data center-focused companies such as Broadcom Inc (AVGO.O), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) could get a boost from Meta's plans. Their stocks rose between 1.4% and 4.3%.

But for Meta, things look bleak a year after it changed its name to focus on the metaverse, a shared virtual reality where people can interact with each other through avatars.

So far this year, Reality Labs, the company's metaverse unit, has already lost $9.44 billion in revenue, while last year the unit recorded more than $10 billion in losses.

Meta has predicted that the unit's losses would grow further in 2023 and pledged to ""pace"" investments after that.

At least 13 brokerages cut their price target on the stock, with J.P. Morgan slashing to a Wall Street low of $115.

38,META,2022-10-26,Turkish competition board fines Meta Platforms $18.6 million,"













ISTANBUL, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Turkey's competition authority has fined Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) 346.72 million lira ($18.63 million) for breaking competition law, it said on Wednesday.

The Turkish regulator said the company held a dominant position in personal social networking services and online video advertising and had obstructed competitors by merging data collected through its core services Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.

In 2021, the competition authority launched an investigation into WhatsApp, and then Facebook Inc., after the messaging app updated its terms of service saying it was reserving the right of its owner Facebook Inc and its subsidiaries to collect user data such as phone numbers and locations, a change that was rolled out globally.

A spokesperson for Meta Platforms said the company disagrees with the probe's findings and will consider all options.

""The 2021 update did not ask users to agree to let Facebook collect user data. It provided clearer, more detailed information to our users on how and why we use data,"" the spokesperson said, adding that there were no changes to WhatsApp's data sharing practices with that update.

Turkey's competition authority said Meta must act to reinstate competition in these markets and prepare annual reports about the steps it will take for the next five years.

It said the fine was based on the company's 2021 income and the company could object to the decision within 60 days.

Social media companies have been a focus of attention in Turkey, which adopted a law last week that would jail journalists and social media users for up to three years for spreading material deemed ""disinformation"".

Analysts have said social media companies are unlikely to abide in full by the law, that requires them to remove such material and to share user data with authorities.

Summary Companies Meta's main content moderation partner exits in E. Africa

Company faces labour abuse, content lawsuits in Kenya

Meta says it invests heavily in content moderation

Campaigners urge it to end outsourcing, tame algorithms















NAIROBI, Jan 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Rights groups are calling on Meta Platforms to seize the opportunity to improve its content moderation in Africa after its main third-party contractor in the region said it would no longer screen harmful posts for the social media giant.

Kenya-based outsourcing firm Sama said on Jan. 10 it would no longer provide content moderation services for the owner of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram in March as it moves to concentrate on data labelling work.

Sama said it would be laying off 3% of its staff - about 200 employees - to streamline its operations and boost efficiency. It will continue to provide data labelling services to Meta.

The announcement comes as both Sama and Meta face a lawsuit over alleged labour abuses and preventing workers from unionising in Kenya. Another lawsuit accuses Meta of allowing violent posts to flourish on Facebook, inflaming civil conflict in neighbouring Ethiopia. Both companies have defended their record.

Digital rights campaigners said efforts made by Meta to curb harmful content in African countries were woefully inadequate compared to richer nations, and called on the company to drastically improve its moderation processes.

""With the exit of Sama, now would be a good chance for Meta to put things right and ensure better labour conditions for African moderators in the region,"" said Bridget Andere, Africa policy analyst at Access Now.

""Meta should increase the number of moderators for the region to adequately cover local languages and dialects, and also be more transparent about their algorithms which are promoting harmful content,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Meta did not provide any details on whether it had found a new third-party contractor for East Africa, but said Sama's withdrawal would not adversely impact users on its social media platforms.

""We respect Sama's decision to exit the content review services it provides to social media platforms,"" a Meta spokesperson said.

""We'll work with our partners during this transition to ensure there's no impact on our ability to review content.""

LEGAL CHALLENGES

Meta's legal challenges in East Africa began in May last year after former moderator Daniel Motaung filed a lawsuit over poor working conditions in Kenya.

The petition, also filed against Sama, alleges that workers moderating Facebook posts faced irregular pay, inadequate mental health support, anti-union activity, and violations of their privacy and dignity.

Sama denies the allegations, while Meta said it requires ""its partners to provide industry-leading pay, benefits and support to workers"".

A judge is expected to rule on Feb. 6 on whether a Kenyan court can hear the complaint.

Last month, Meta was landed with another lawsuit that accuses the company of allowing violent posts to flourish on Facebook, inflaming Ethiopia's civil war.

The lawsuit, filed by two Ethiopian researchers and Kenya's Katiba Institute rights group, argues that Facebook's recommendations systems amplified hateful and violent posts in Ethiopia, including several that preceded the murder of the father of one of the researchers.

The plaintiffs are demanding that Meta take emergency steps to demote violent content, increase moderation staffing in Nairobi, and create restitution funds of about $2 billion for global victims of violence incited on Facebook.

Meta said it has strict rules outlining what is and is not allowed on Facebook and Instagram.

""Hate speech and incitement to violence are against these rules and we invest heavily in teams and technology to help us find and remove this content,"" the Meta spokesperson said.

""Our safety and integrity work in Ethiopia is guided by feedback from local civil society organizations and international institutions.""

END OUTSOURCING, REVIEW ALGORITHMS

Globally, thousands of moderators review social media posts that could contain violence, nudity, racism or other offensive content. Many work for third-party contractors rather than directly for tech companies.

Meta has faced previous scrutiny over content moderators' working conditions, and criticism of its action to stop hate speech and violent content.

In July 2021, a California judge approved an $85 million settlement between Facebook and more than 10,000 moderators who accused the firm of failing to protect them from psychological injuries due to their exposure to graphic and violent imagery.

The same year, Rohingya refugees from Myanmar filed a lawsuit, suing Meta for $150 billion over allegations the company did not take action against anti-Rohingya hate speech which contributed to violence against the minority group.

Rights groups say moderation processes fail to understand specific cultural and societal contexts, and lack knowledge of local languages and dialects, allowing problematic content to spread quickly and be amplified with serious consequences.

Cori Crider, director of Foxglove - a London-based tech-justice advocacy group which is supporting both lawsuits in Kenya - called on Meta to end its outsourcing practices and increase the ""pitiful"" resources it puts into safety in Africa.

""Facebook should take moderation in-house, hire every one of the 260 content moderators in Nairobi who do vital safety work, and value these people with decent wages, full clinical mental health support and dignity and prestige,"" Crider said.

""Outsourcing is broken and both workers and ordinary people have paid the price.""

Alia Al Ghussain, AI and human rights researcher at Amnesty International, said Facebook's algorithms - which power its news feed, ranking, recommendations and groups features, shaping what users see on the platform - also needed scrutiny.

""Meta's engagement-based business model means algorithms are programmed to cause content which is harmful and inflammatory to go viral,"" said Al Ghussain, whose organisation is supporting the lawsuit over Ethiopia.

""The litigation that we are seeing both in the Ethiopia case and the Myanmar case clearly demonstrate that the problem is systemic and urgently needs to be addressed through regulation.""

May 31 (Reuters) - Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) will use Broadcom Inc's (AVGO.O) custom chips to build its metaverse hardware, becoming the chipmaker's next billion-dollar ASIC customer, analysts at J.P. Morgan said on Tuesday.

ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) chips will drive $2 billion to $2.5 billion in revenue for Broadcom this year, helped by its deals with Meta and partnerships with Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), the analysts said.

""We believe these wins are primarily at 5 nanometre and 3 nanometre and will be used to power Meta's metaverse hardware architecture that it will deploy over the next few years,"" analyst Harlan Sur said.

Meta is investing heavily in the metaverse - a virtual space where people interact, work and play - by adding new features to hardware devices that serve as access points to the virtual world.

Sur added that Meta will emerge as Broadcom's next $1 billion-a-year ASIC customer over the next three to four years after Google.

ASICs are designed to perform hyper-specific tasks, including in AI and machine learning, efficiently.

Broadcom and Google have co-developed Google's custom chip used for machine learnings tasks since 2016 and the brokerage estimates this to be worth over $1.3 billion in 2022.

Meta is developing a range of hardware products for the metaverse that include smart glasses and virtual reality headsets, and has even opened its first physical store where shoppers can try out these devices and other gadgets. read more

""Near-term ASIC program pipeline is strong as we believe Broadcom will be ramping Meta/Facebook and Microsoft ASICs this year,"" Sur added.

Broadcom's semiconductor solutions business, which makes custom chips, contributed more than 70% to the company's nearly $27.5 billion revenue in 2021.

Companies Law firms EBay's Quinn Emanuel lawyers ask court to quash Meta bid for deposition

Latest pretrial flashpoint as Meta seeks info to fight FTC















March 14 (Reuters) - E-commerce platform eBay Inc (EBAY.O) on Monday asked a U.S. judge to block a bid by Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) for testimony from an eBay corporate official as the social media giant seeks rivals' information to counter a Federal Trade Commission antitrust lawsuit.

EBay's lawyers from Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan said in a filing in San Francisco federal court that Meta is demanding confidential business information about eBay's privacy policies, data retention and other topics that are not relevant to the FTC's monopoly claims.

The subpoena fight is the latest flashpoint in Meta's campaign to squeeze information from other technology and social media companies in advance of a possible trial next year against the FTC.

Meta has faced some resistance from other companies that said its demands for information were too broad or invasive. In November, a judge ruled Sequoia Capital could not quash subpoenas from Meta seeking information about how the venture capital firm analyzed the photo-sharing site Instagram and the messaging service WhatsApp before Meta bought them.

""Meta's discovery gluttony confirms its request of eBay is not worthy of the burden Meta seeks to impose,"" eBay's lawyers told the California court. ""The breadth of the subpoena,"" they said, ""is alarming.""

A Meta spokesperson said in a statement that the company is ""seeking information from companies with which we compete or which we believe have information relating to the FTC's claims.""

The FTC sued Meta in D.C. federal court in 2020, accusing the company of abusing its power in the ""personal social networking services"" market. The lawsuit seeks to force Meta to sell the photo-sharing app Instagram and messaging platform WhatsApp.

Meta has denied the FTC's antitrust allegations. Among other defenses, it disputes the FTC's asserted ""personal social networking services"" market.

EBay's Quinn Emanuel attorneys derided Meta as a ""litigant that has completely disregarded the bounds of reason and proportionality"" in seeking information from third parties.

A representative from eBay and its attorneys at Quinn Emanuel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The FTC declined to comment.

Lawyers for eBay contend the company doesn't compete with Meta on social networking but does face off over the Facebook Marketplace e-commerce service.

EBay said it has already disclosed nearly 2,500 pages of internal records to Meta.

But the company said it ""should not be forced to divulge further confidential information to a competitor absent a clear showing the information will be relevant and necessary, which is not the case here.""

The case is Federal Trade Commission v. Meta Platforms Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 3:23-mc-80074.

Lawsuit says Facebook, Instagram distributing hundreds of its tracks















(Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc's Facebook and Instagram platforms violated thousands of copyrights belonging to Epidemic Sound AB, the Swedish music label said in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in San Francisco federal court.

Epidemic said Meta stored hundreds of its tracks in Facebook's and Instagram's music libraries and let users download them, stream them and incorporate them into videos without permission.

The lawsuit also said Meta tools that allow users to incorporate music from another user's video in their own has caused ""exponential"" additional infringement.

Meta distributed Epidemic's music across ""millions of videos"" that have been seen ""billions of times"" and tens of thousands more infringing videos are uploaded to Facebook and Instagram daily, the lawsuit said.

Epidemic declined to comment. Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.

Epidemic's law firm Pryor Cashman also represents immersive virtual-reality company MetaX in a lawsuit filed against Meta in New York earlier this week. A firm spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday about the cases.

Wednesday's lawsuit said Epidemic owns and distributes a library of more than 38,000 pieces of music for creators to use royalty-free to accompany videos, podcasts and other content.

According to Epidemic, Meta reproduced at least 950 of the tracks in its music library, which Facebook and Instagram users can synchronize with their videos in the platforms' Stories and Reels.

Meta has allegedly known of the infringement since 2017 and has refused to let Epidemic access the tools that it lets others use to protect their copyrights.

The label asked for an unspecified amount of money damages and an order stopping Meta from using its tracks.

Summary Related documents Blockchain nonprofit Dfinity Foundation said Meta's infinity-sign logo will be confused with its own

Lawsuit said association with Meta could hurt privacy-focused business















(Reuters) - A nonprofit blockchain developer sued Meta Platforms Inc in California federal court Friday, alleging a new logo adopted by the company formerly known as Facebook will cause consumer confusion with its own infinity-symbol logo.

Switzerland-based Dfinity said being associated with Meta's ""sordid"" history with user privacy could hurt the non-profit's efforts to attract people to its blockchain platform, which it wants to use to ""take on Big Tech and its growing control over user data.""

Dfinity was founded in 2016. Its Internet Computer is an ""infinite"" public blockchain network designed to host authenticated smart contracts. It registered a federal trademark for its infinity-symbol logo in 2018.

Meta, Dfinity, and Dfinity's attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Facebook Inc rebranded as Meta last October to reflect its plans to focus on the virtual-reality ""metaverse."" Meta has described its new logo as a ""continuous loop"" that resembles both the letter 'M' and an infinity sign, ""symbolizing infinite horizons in the metaverse.""

Dfinity's lawsuit said Meta's logo is confusingly similar to its logo. It also said that a Meta executive outlined plans to adopt blockchain technologies in an internal memo, which would add to the likelihood of confusion between the companies.

44,META,2023-03-07,"Meta must face trial over AI trade secrets, judge says","













March 6 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) lost a bid on Monday to end a lawsuit in Boston federal court claiming it stole confidential information from artificial-intelligence startup Neural Magic Inc.

Meta will have to face a trial over accusations that it took Neural Magic's ""breakthrough"" algorithms that enable AI systems to process information more quickly, U.S. District Judge Denise Casper said.

The court also allowed testimony from an expert who said Meta owes Neural Magic as much as $766 million in royalties.

Representatives for Meta and Neural Magic did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the decision. The trial is currently set to begin in September.

Somerville, Massachusetts-based Neural Magic was founded by two former Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers. Its investors include venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, VMware, Comcast and Verizon, according to its website.

Neural Magic sued Meta, then known as Facebook, in 2020 for allegedly stealing algorithms that enable simpler computers to run complex mathematical calculations more efficiently and allow research scientists to use larger data sets.

The lawsuit said Meta hired away a Neural Magic computer scientist, Aleksandar Zlateski, who gave the social-media giant the algorithms that make up the ""heart"" of Neural Magic's technology.

Neural Magic said Meta published the algorithms on open-source website GitHub and thanked Zlateski for solving a ""key problem for Facebook's continued advancement in the world of artificial intelligence.""

Meta asked the court to throw out the case last year, arguing Neural Magic had failed to identify any protectable trade secrets and that Zlateski had not acquired the information improperly. But the court on Monday allowed Neural Magic's case to continue for all but one of the 41 secrets it accused Meta of misappropriating.

Casper granted parts of Meta and Zlateski's request, rejecting Neural Magic's claims that they violated a non-competition clause or engaged in unfair business practices under Massachusetts law.

The case is Neural Magic Inc v. Meta Platforms Inc, U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, No. 1:20-cv-10444.

45,META,2022-12-20,Meta to delay closing Within Unlimited deal by one month,"













Dec 20 (Reuters) - Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META.O) does not expect to seal its acquisition deal with Within Unlimited, maker of the popular fitness app ""Supernatural"", before Jan. 31, according to a court filing from Tuesday.

Meta has agreed to push back the closing by one month or until the first day after the court rules on U.S. Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) preliminary injunction trial, according to the filing with the United States District Court for the Northern District Of California.

In August, Meta had agreed not to close the deal until 11:59 p.m. on Dec. 31.

The FTC had filed a lawsuit seeking to stop the deal in July, calling Facebook a ""global technology behemoth,"" noting its ownership of popular apps including Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, and said its ""campaign to conquer VR (virtual reality)"" began in 2014 when it acquired Oculus, a VR headset manufacturer.

The FTC filed a slimmed-down complaint in October against the merger, focusing on the VR-dedicated exercise app market and dropped allegations related to the broader VR fitness app market.

Meta already has the best-selling VR headset, the Quest 2, and controls a Meta Quest Store with hundreds of apps. Within Unlimited, founded in 2014, creates original content for virtual reality. It describes itself as ""the premier destination for cinematic virtual reality.""

46,META,2022-05-10,Content moderator in Kenya sues Meta over working conditions,"













NAIROBI, May 10 (Reuters) - A former moderator working for Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) on Tuesday filed a lawsuit alleging that poor working conditions for contracted content moderators violate the Kenyan constitution.

The petition, also filed against Meta's local outsourcing company Sama, alleges that workers moderating Facebook posts in Kenya have been subjected to unreasonable working conditions including irregular pay, inadequate mental health support, union-busting, and violations of their privacy and dignity.

The lawsuit, filed by one person on behalf of a group, seeks financial compensation, an order that outsourced moderators have the same health care and pay scale as Meta employees, that unionization rights be protected, and an independent human rights audit of the office.

A Meta spokesperson told Reuters: ""We take our responsibility to the people who review content for Meta seriously and require our partners to provide industry-leading pay, benefits and support. We also encourage content reviewers to raise issues when they become aware of them and regularly conduct independent audits to ensure our partners are meeting the high standards we expect.”

Sama declined to comment before seeing the lawsuit but has previously rejected claims that its employees were paid unfairly, that the recruitment process was opaque, or that its mental health benefits were inadequate.

The lawsuit’s specific requests for action are more granular and wide-ranging than those sought in previous cases and could reverberate beyond Kenya.

“This could have ripple effects. Facebook is going to have to reveal a lot about how they run their moderation operation,” said Odanga Madung, a fellow at the Mozilla Foundation, a U.S.-based global nonprofit dedicated to internet rights.

Globally, thousands of moderators review social media posts that could depict violence, nudity, racism or other offensive content. Many work for third party contractors rather than tech companies.

Meta has already faced scrutiny over content moderators' working conditions.

Last year, a California judge approved an $85 million settlement between Facebook and more than 10,000 content moderators who had accused the company of failing to protect them from psychological injuries resulting from their exposure to graphic and violent imagery.

REUTERS/Baz Ratner 1 2 3 4 5

Facebook did not admit wrongdoing in the California case but agreed to take measures to provide its content moderators, who are employed by third-party vendors, with safer work environments.

VIOLENT VIDEOS

The Kenyan lawsuit was filed on behalf of Daniel Motaung, recruited in 2019 from South Africa to work for Sama in Nairobi. Motaung says he was not given details about the nature of the work reviewing Facebook posts before his arrival.

The first video Motaung remembers moderating was a beheading. The disturbing content piled up, but Motaung says his pay and mental health support were inadequate.

“I have been diagnosed with severe PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder),” Motaung told Reuters. ""I am living ...a horror movie.""

Motaung’s lawyers said that Meta and Sama created a dangerous and degrading environment where workers were not given the same protections as employees in other countries.

""If in Dublin, people can't look at harmful content for two hours, that should be the rule everywhere,"" Motaung's lawyer Mercy Mutemi said. ""If they need to have a psychologist on call that should apply everywhere.”

Shortly after joining Sama, Motaung tried to form a union to advocate for the company's roughly 200 workers in Nairobi.

He was fired soon after, which he and his lawyers say was because of the unionization attempt. Union rights are enshrined in the Kenyan constitution.

Sama has not commented on this allegation.

Motaung’s experience was first revealed in an investigation published by Time magazine in February.

47,META,2023-02-15,Facebook owner Meta increases Zuckerberg's security allowance by $4 million,"













Feb 15 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) said on Wednesday it had increased the security allowance given to Chief Executive and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and his family by $4 million to $14 million.

""This increased allowance, together with the costs of Zuckerberg's existing overall security program, are appropriate and necessary under the circumstances,"" Meta said in a filing.

The move comes at a time when the owner of social media platforms Facebook and Instagram has cut thousands of jobs and slashed spending plans for a period that Zuckerberg has called the ""Year of Efficiency.""

The 38-year-old, who ranks as the 16th richest person in the Forbes billionaire list, earned a compensation of about $27 million in 2021. Meta is yet to disclose his pay package for last year.

The Financial Times reported last week that Meta had delayed finalizing the budgets of multiple teams as it was preparing for a fresh round of job cuts. read more

May 3 (Reuters) - Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) is opening up access to a large language model for artificial intelligence research, the social media company said on Tuesday.

Meta said its model was the first 175-billion-parameter language model to be made available to the broader AI research community.

""Large language models"" are natural language processing systems which are trained on massive volumes of text, and are capable of answering reading comprehension questions or generating new text.

In a blog post, Meta said the release of its ""Open Pretrained Transformer (OPT-175B)"" model would improve researchers' abilities to understand how large language models work.

Meta said restrictions on access to such models had been ""hindering progress on efforts to improve their robustness and mitigate known issues such as bias and toxicity"".

Artificial intelligence technology, which is a key area of research and development for several major online platforms, can perpetuate humans' societal biases around issues like race and gender. Some researchers have concerns about the harms that can be spread through large language models.

Meta said it ""hoped to increase the diversity of voices defining the ethical considerations of such technologies.""

The tech giant said to prevent misuse and ""maintain integrity,"" it was releasing the model under a noncommercial license to focus on research use cases.

Meta said access to the model would be granted to academic researchers and people affiliated with government, civil society and academic organizations, as well as industry research laboratories. The release will include the pretrained models and the code to train and use them.

50,META,2022-07-26,Meta bumps prices of Quest 2 headsets ahead of successor release,"













July 26 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) said on Tuesday it would raise the prices of its Meta Quest 2 virtual reality (VR) headset by about $100 from August, even as the company prepares to launch a successor headset later this year.

With its rebrand in November last year, Meta has doubled down on metaverse and VR. It recently announced upgrades to its VR platform, Horizon Worlds, and opened a physical store for users to demo the headsets.

Meta said the 128-gigabyte and 256-gigabyte versions of Quest 2 will retail for $399.99 and $499.99, respectively. It also bumped prices for some accessories and refurbished units.

""We're making a change that will help us continue to invest for the long term and keep driving the VR industry forward,"" Meta said in a statement, adding that users have spent over $1 billion on Meta Quest apps.

Meta said it will launch a new high-end VR headset, code-named Project Cambria, later this year, without mentioning a date or device specifications.

Meanwhile, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is said to be working on its own VR headset, according to reports. (https://reut.rs/3baXvJJ)

51,META,2023-03-06,Meta will keep releasing AI tools despite leak claims,"













March 6 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) on Monday said it will continue to release its artificial intelligence tools to approved researchers despite claims on online message boards that its latest large language model had leaked to unauthorized users.

""While the model is not accessible to all, and some have tried to circumvent the approval process, we believe the current release strategy allows us to balance responsibility and openness,"" Meta said in a statement.

Facebook owner Meta maintains a major AI research arm and last month released LLaMA, short for Large Language Model Meta AI. Meta claimed that the model can achieve the kind of human-like conversational abilities of AI systems designed by ChatGPT creator OpenAI and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) while using far less computing power.

Unlike some rivals such as OpenAI, which keeps tight wraps on its technology and charges software developers to access it, Meta's AI research arm shares most of its work openly. But AI tools also contain the potential for abuse, such as creating and spreading false information.

To avoid those kinds of misuse, Meta makes its tools available to researchers and other entities affiliated with government, civil society and academia under a non-commercial license after a vetting process.

Last week, users on the online forum 4Chan claimed to have made the model available for download. Reuters could not independently verify those claims.

In its statement, Meta said its LLaMA release was handled in the same way as previous models and that it does not plan to change its strategy.

""It’s Meta's goal to share state-of-the-art AI models with members of the research community to help us evaluate and improve those models,"" Meta said.

52,META,2022-05-10,Meta criticises German antitrust watchdog's 'flawed' data curb order,"[1/2] A sign is seen outside of the inaugural physical store of Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc in Burlingame, California, U.S. May 4, 2022. REUTERS/Brittany Hosea-Small















LUXEMBOURG, May 10 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms (FB.O), owner of Facebook, on Tuesday criticised a landmark German antitrust order to curb its data collection as 'clearly flawed' and which undermines EU data protection rules.

Meta's criticism of the German antitrust watchdog came after the latter in 2019 said the world's largest social network had abused its market power by collecting users' data without their consent and ordered it to stop.

The competition enforcer said the data harvest included users' browsing habits when they visited a website with a Facebook 'like' button on it - even if an internet surfer didn't click on that button.

The case underscores the mounting regulatory scrutiny worldwide of U.S. tech giants and measures to rein in their power.

In the German case, however, the issue is also whether the watchdog exceeded its authority by using its antitrust power to address data protection concerns.

Meta challenged the decision at a German court which subsequently sought guidance from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).

The German antitrust order was ""clearly flawed"" with its ""far reaching restriction on Facebook's data processing"", Meta lawyer Hans-Georg Kamann told the panel of 15 judges.

He criticised the German watchdog for not cooperating with the Irish data protection regulator which supervises Facebook because its European headquarters is in Ireland.

""The Bundeskartellamt has openly undermined the substantive and procedural requirements of GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) law,"" Kamann said.

Joerg Nothdurft, lawyer for the German watchdog, dismissed the criticism, saying there had been contact with data protection regulators.

The German government defended the antitrust decision, saying that it was imperative for the competition enforcer to make data protection assessment as part of its investigation as online marketplaces use users' data to gain market power.

The German order ""serves the objective of protecting free competition"" and was not about data protection, its lawyer Philipp Krueger said.

The CJEU court adviser will give her non-binding opinion on Sept. 20, with judges expected to follow with a ruling in the coming months.

The case is C-252/21 Meta Platforms and others.

Feb 27 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) is creating a new top-level product group focused on generative artificial intelligence (AI), Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Monday, as the AI race among Big Tech firms heats up.

AI has emerged as a bright spot for investments in the tech industry, which has been struggling with slowing growth, and has cut thousands of jobs, as well as dialed down on experimental bets to beat the downturn.

""We're starting by pulling together a lot of the teams working on generative AI across the company into one group focused on building delightful experiences around this technology,"" Zuckerberg said in an Instagram post.

""Over the longer term, we'll focus on developing AI personas that can help people in a variety of ways,"" Zuckerberg said, but for now ""we're exploring experiences with text (chat in WhatsApp and Messenger), with images (creative Instagram filters and ad formats), and with video and multi-modal experiences.""

Ahmad Al-Dahle will lead the new product team, which will report to Chris Cox, Meta's chief product officer, a company spokesperson confirmed. This will enable Meta to more rapidly implement the AI research team's findings in Meta's products, the spokesperson said.

The public battle to dominate the AI technology space kicked off late last year with the launch of Microsoft-backed (MSFT.O) OpenAI's ChatGPT, which has since prompted tech heavyweights from Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) to China's Baidu Inc (9888.HK), to announce their own offerings.

Last week, Facebook-parent Meta said it was releasing a new large language model LLaMA, the core software of a new AI system, which would be available under non-commercial license to researchers and entities affiliated with government, civil society and academia.

Shares of Meta Platforms closed down 0.5% on Monday.

WASHINGTON, June 6 (Reuters) - Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) has named a company vice president as chief information security officer (CISO), the first person to fill that role at the social media company.

Guy Rosen, who has been at Facebook since 2013 and most recently led the company's product safety and integrity efforts, said on Twitter in his new role he ""will continue to oversee and look across the breadth of safety & security risks the people who use our services, our company and industry face.""

This is the first CISO Facebook has had. Facebook was renamed Meta Platforms in October 2021 but it kept the name ""Facebook"" for its social media app.

Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a memo seen by Reuters that he had asked Rosen to assume the job and said the move was ""another step to elevate this security work in our DNA - and strengthen our leadership and governance on security issues.""

In his expanded role, Rosen ""will have overall accountability for safety and security around on-platform abuse as well as the security of our products, infrastructure and company information - focused on both internal and external risks,"" Zuckerberg wrote.

Facebook's previous chief security officer, Alex Stamos, left in 2018.

55,META,2022-04-06,"Meta plans virtual currency, creator coins for its apps - FT","













April 6 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) is readying plans to introduce virtual tokens and cryptocurrencies to its family of apps with an aim to use such virtual tokens for rewarding creators and lending and other financial services, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday.

The move, which is reported to be in its early stages, comes as Meta grows its focus on services centered around the metaverse, a virtual environment where people interact, work and play.

If implemented, it could also give Meta a new revenue channel and control over transactions in its suite of apps and services, which include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and the Meta Quest virtual reality platform.

Meta's cryptocurrencies, internally dubbed ""Zuck Bucks"", are intended for the metaverse and may not be based on blockchain, the FT report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

Meta could introduce in-app tokens that would be centrally controlled by the company, the report said, and such tokens could be used to pay favorite creators on Instagram or reward people who make meaningful contributions in Facebook groups.

""We have no updates to share today,"" a Meta spokesperson told Reuters on Wednesday, adding that the company is focused on building for the metaverse ""and that includes what payments and financial services might look like.""

Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Meta, said last month that Instagram will introduce non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the ""near-term"".

Earlier this year, Meta joined the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), a group of companies led by Jack Dorsey's Block Inc (SQ.N) that has pledged to promote open access to cryptocurrency technologies.

56,META,2022-10-04,Meta pushes Reels monetization with new ad formats,"













Oct 4 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) announced a series of new ad formats on Tuesday, aimed at creating new revenue streams for the short video and business messaging products that it has identified as key to growth this year.

In a blog post, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram said it was starting tests for a new skippable ""post-loop"" video ad format to play after its TikTok-like short video product Reels, which it has been promoting heavily.

Another new Reels format features horizontally scrollable carousel ads, which can display between two and 10 images at the bottom of a Reel, the post said.

Describing the company's business strategy at a press event, Meta executives said the new formats could lure Reels creators with ways to earn money from ad placements next to their videos.

""Our goal is to be able to provide the tools and the monetization opportunities, as you are continually growing your creator following across our platforms,"" said Nada Stirratt, vice president of Meta's global business group for the Americas.

The executives also touted ads that open direct chats between businesses and prospective customers saying Meta can now use artificial intelligence to optimize whether the ads target new customers or those most likely to make a purchase.

Artificial intelligence would, likewise, power the selection of ads shown in users' Instagram feeds, the company said, citing internal research involving 400,000 advertisers that showed the approach produced more user purchases than other feed ads.

Meta is also opening up new spaces for advertising on Instagram, including the 'Explore' tab that users see when they run a search in the app, the blog post said.

57,META,2023-01-25,Meta to reinstate Donald Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts,"













Jan 25 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) said Wednesday it will reinstate former U.S. President Donald Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts in the coming weeks, following a two-year suspension after the deadly Capitol Hill riot on January 6, 2021.

The restoration of his accounts could provide a boost to Trump, who announced in November he will make another run for the White House in 2024. He has 34 million followers on Facebook and 23 million on Instagram, platforms that are key vehicles for political outreach and fundraising.

His Twitter account was restored in November by new owner Elon Musk, though Trump has yet to post there.

Free speech advocates say it is appropriate for the public to have access to messaging from political candidates, but critics of Meta have accused the company of lax moderating policies.

Meta said in a blog post Wednesday it has ""put new guardrails in place to deter repeat offenses.""

""In the event that Mr. Trump posts further violating content, the content will be removed and he will be suspended for between one month and two years, depending on the severity of the violation,"" wrote Nick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs, in the blog post.

The decision, while widely expected, drew sharp rebukes from civil rights advocates. ""Facebook has policies but they under-enforce them,"" said Laura Murphy, an attorney who led a two-year long audit of Facebook concluding in 2020. ""I worry about Facebook's capacity to understand the real world harm that Trump poses: Facebook has been too slow to act.""

The Anti-Defamation League, the NAACP, Free Press and other groups also expressed concern Wednesday over Facebook's ability to prevent any future attacks on the democratic process, with Trump still repeating his false claim that he won the 2020 presidential election.

Others said it was the right decision.

Jameel Jaffer, executive director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and a former ACLU official, defended the reinstatement. He had previously endorsed the company's decision to suspend Trump's account.

""The public has an interest in hearing directly from candidates for political office,"" said Jaffer. ""It's better if the major social media platforms err on the side of leaving speech up, even if the speech is offensive or false, so that it can be addressed by other users and other institutions.""

OTHER REACTIVATIONS?

The decision to ban Trump was a polarizing one for Meta, the world's biggest social media company, which prior to the Trump suspension had never blocked the account of a sitting head of state for violating its content rules.

The company indefinitely revoked Trump's access to his Facebook and Instagram accounts after removing two of his posts during the Capitol Hill violence, including a video in which he reiterated his false claim of widespread voter fraud during the 2020 presidential election.

It then referred the case to its independent oversight board, which ruled that the suspension was justified but its indeterminate nature was not. In response, Meta said it would revisit the suspension two years after it began.

Meta's blog post Wednesday suggested it may reactivate other suspended accounts, including those penalized for their involvement in civil unrest. The company said those reinstated accounts would be subject to more stringent review and penalties for violations.

Whether, and how, Trump will seize upon the opportunity to return to Facebook and Instagram is unclear.

Trump has not sent any new tweets since regaining his account on Twitter, saying he would prefer to stick with his own app Truth Social. But his campaign spokesman told Fox News Digital last week that being back on Facebook ""will be an important tool for the 2024 campaign to reach voters.""

In a post on Truth Social, Trump responded to his reinstatement on Meta apps, saying: ""Such a thing should never again happen to a sitting President, or anybody else who is not deserving of retribution!"" He did not indicate if or when he would begin posting on Meta platforms again.

Representative Adam Schiff, a Democrat who previously chaired the House Intelligence Committee, criticized the decision to reinstate him.

""Trump incited an insurrection,"" Schiff wrote on Twitter. ""Giving him back access to a social media platform to spread his lies and demagoguery is dangerous.""

Feb 1 (Reuters) - A rise in a key advertising metric for Snap Inc (SNAP.N) that reported an otherwise insipid quarter could bode well for Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O), analysts said on Wednesday.

Shares of the Snapchat owner fell 13% on a dour revenue forecast, which the company blamed on a weak economy and stiff competition. But Snap's direct response advertising business, which is key for market leaders Meta and Google, was a bright spot.

Sales from the business rose 4% in the fourth quarter, Snap said.

""Snap is impacted by the reality that it has significant brand advertising exposure (which is getting hit harder than direct response),"" said Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney.

Headwinds for Meta and Google could be notably less severe, he said.

Alphabet's Google, the world's largest digital advertising platform, has long fared better than other ad-dependent companies because brands deem ads on Google searches crucial to driving website visits or other consumer actions.

Meta has said the bulk of its revenue also comes from direct response advertising. Facebook and Instagram reach billions of users, turning them into a key part of the marketing strategies of many brands.

Snap's direct response performance was a more positive takeaway for Meta than Alphabet, said CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino, pointing to Meta's progress with measurement, optimization and artificial intelligence enhancements on its platform.

Snap performed worse than Meta, Alphabet and Pinterest in the past year

Snap's shares were trading at $10 on Wednesday. The company's weak outlook pulled down shares of Meta and Pinterest (PINS.N), which also earns revenue by selling digital advertising.

Analysts expect Meta to post a 6.5% fall in December-quarter revenue when it reports results later on Wednesday, its third consecutive quarter of decline, according to Refinitiv.

Alphabet will report results on Thursday, and analysts expect revenue to be unchanged from a year earlier.

Snap's challenges, including privacy changes on Apple Inc (AAPL.O) devices that have made it harder for marketers to collect data, are not unique to the company. But it has the ""added challenge of being a small player,"" said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence.

""Advertisers are turning to tried and true platforms.""

July 19 (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) was hit with a trademark lawsuit in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday by MetaX LLC, a company that creates immersive virtual-reality experiences, for allegedly stealing its name for its pivot to the metaverse.

New York-based MetaX told the court it had been ""crushed"" by Facebook's rebrand and said its ""ability to operate as Meta has been eviscerated.""

It accused Meta Platforms of infringing its federal ""Meta"" trademarks, and requested a court order that blocks the social media company from using ""Meta"" for goods and services that overlap with MetaX's as well as an unspecified amount of money damages.

Meta Platforms rebranded from its eponymous social networking platform in October 2021, betting that the metaverse, a shared virtual realm, will succeed mobile internet.

MetaX's founder, Justin ""JB"" Bolognino, said in a statement that Meta Platforms had ""not only put our business in jeopardy, but that of the entire industry and the intellectual property rights of the innovators that have helped build it.""

Meta Platforms did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

MetaX specializes in ""experiential and immersive technologies"" using technologies like VR and augmented reality.

The company said in the lawsuit it had discussed a potential partnership with Facebook in 2017, and that a Facebook executive had praised one of MetaX's experiences that year as ""amazing"" and ""spectacular.""

MetaX said Meta Platforms' new focus on the metaverse and related VR and augmented-reality technology overlaps with its business and that it has started providing similar ""immersive experiences"" at some of the same places where it hosted its exhibits, including Coachella and South by Southwest.

MetaX said Meta Platforms' rebrand will drive it out of the marketplace, and that it has already caused people to mistakenly believe the companies are affiliated.

61,META,2023-02-10,"Meta, law firm Gibson Dunn sanctioned in Facebook privacy case","













Feb 9 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday sanctioned Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and its law firm, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher for “delay, misdirection and frivolous arguments” in a data privacy lawsuit over the company’s sharing of user information with third-parties.

U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco ordered Meta, Facebook’s parent company, and Gibson Dunn to pay about $925,000 over what he said was an effort to make the litigation unnecessarily difficult and expensive for the plaintiffs.

Chhabria, who has long been critical of Gibson Dunn’s handling of the case, said the firm and Facebook mounted a “sustained, concerted, bad-faith effort to throw obstacle after obstacle in front of the plaintiffs—all in an attempt to push the plaintiffs into settling the case for less than they would have gotten otherwise.""

Representatives for Gibson Dunn and Facebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The firm has argued in court filings that it followed court orders and has blamed the plaintiffs for issuing “unreasonable and incessant” demands for company documents. Los Angeles-founded Gibson Dunn has represented the company in numerous matters.

Meta, Facebook’s parent company, agreed last year to pay $725 million to settle the lawsuit, which was sparked by revelations in 2018 that Facebook had allowed British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to access data of as many as 87 million users. The company did not admit wrongdoing.

In Thursday’s decision, the judge faulted Meta and its lawyers for claiming they were only required to produce internal documents in the case about user data the company admitted it shared with third-parties. The court had ordered Facebook to turn over data it had collected on the plaintiffs in the case, regardless of whether it had been shared.

The judge also accused Meta's legal team of needlessly delaying turning over documents related to an internal investigation Facebook had commissioned into third-party apps that accessed user data.

The case is IN RE: Facebook, INC. Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 18-md-02843-VC.

Law firms Related documents Meta seeks internal docs from rival social network company

Snap's lawyers contend subpoena is too broad, burdensome

Dispute tied to FTC's antitrust case in D.C. federal court















(Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc on Wednesday asked a California federal judge to force Snap Inc to turn over internal corporate documents that the Facebook parent company said it needs to defend against U.S. Federal Trade Commission's antitrust claims.

In a filing in Los Angeles federal court, Meta's lawyers called Snap ""centrally important"" to the FTC's case as a rival of Meta's Facebook platform and said the company has ""refused to provide the vast majority"" of information sought through subpoenas in February.

Meta said it was seeking records that include information about how Snap viewed Meta's acquisitions of photo-sharing site Instagram in 2012 and the messaging platform WhatsApp in 2014. The FTC's lawsuit in Washington, D.C., federal court accused Meta of abusing its market power and seeks to unwind those deals. Meta has denied any market abuses.

Federal judges routinely are called on to referee disputes where one company demands business information from another, and the California court can be expected to address whether, as Snap claimed in Wednesday's jointly submitted filing, Meta's demand is too broad and overly burdensome.

Meta said in a statement on Wednesday that the ""subpoena we served on Snap is standard procedure in civil antitrust litigation"" and ""is important to the preparation of Meta's defense against the FTC's meritless case.""

Snap has asked the court to quash or narrow Meta's subpoenas. In a statement, a Snap representative said the company should not be compelled to ""share untold mountains of documents and data, including the most competitively sensitive information in Snap's possession.""

In the D.C. litigation, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in January declined Meta's bid to dismiss the agency's antitrust lawsuit.

Meta's push for records would require Snap to ""reconstruct virtually every decision Snap has made,"" an attorney for Snap, Justina Sessions of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich Rosati, said in Wednesday's court filing.

Sessions did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment, and Meta's lawyers at O'Melveny & Myers and Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick did not immediately respond to a similar request.

The FTC has proposed a December 2023 trial date, and Meta has asked the court for more time.

The case is Meta Platforms Inc v. Snap Inc, U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, No. 2:22-mc-00146.

For Meta: Catalina Joos Vergara of O'Melveny & Myers, and Kevin Huff of Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick

NEW YORK, June 21 (Reuters) - The United States and Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc have settled a lawsuit over a housing advertising system that illegally discriminated against users based on race and other characteristics, the Department of Justice said on Tuesday.

In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan, the Department of Justice (DOJ) said Meta encouraged advertisers to target users based on features like race, religion, and sex, in violation of the Federal Housing Act. That law prohibits discrimination in housing based on such characteristics.

Meta denied wrongdoing, but agreed to pay a $115,054 civil penalty, the highest allowed under the law. Complaints over ads-based discrimination have dogged the company since 2016, and the company has reached settlements with Washington state and rights groups over similar allegations.

As part of the deal, the company agreed to stop using an algorithmic tool known as ""Special Ad Audience"" and design a new housing advertising tool by the end of the year.

""Because of this ground-breaking lawsuit, Meta will — for the first time — change its ad delivery system to address algorithmic discrimination,"" Damian Williams, the U.S. Attorney for Manhattan, said in a statement.

Meta said it would also use the new system for advertisements related to jobs and credit.

""Discrimination in housing, employment and credit is a deep-rooted problem with a long history in the U.S., and we are committed to broadening opportunities for marginalized communities in these spaces and others,"" the company said in a statement.

The case stems from a 2019 civil charge filed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The DOJ said Facebook made some changes as part of its 2019 settlement with rights groups, but said that deal did not address the delivery of ads through machine-learning algorithms.

The settlement reached on Tuesday is subject to review by a judge.

64,META,2022-04-05,Facebook owner Meta briefly blocks hashtags tied to Bucha killings,"













April 4 (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta Platforms (FB.O) briefly restricted hashtags related to civilian deaths in northern Ukraine, where bodies of people shot at close range were found in a town seized back from Russian forces, a company spokesman confirmed on Monday.

The killings in Bucha, outside Kyiv, have drawn pledges of further sanctions against Moscow from the West. read more

Meta spokesman Andy Stone said automated systems that scan for violent imagery on Facebook and Instagram, which the company also owns, were responsible for blocking hashtags including #bucha and #buchamassacre.

""This happened automatically because of the graphic content people posted using these hashtags. When we were made aware of the issue yesterday, we acted quickly to unblock the hashtags,"" he wrote on Twitter.

Facebook and Instagram permit the posting of graphic and violent content when it is shared to raise awareness of possible human rights abuses, but deletes the content if it is extremely explicit or celebrates suffering.

The social media company also adds warning labels to some graphic posts that users must click through before they can see the images.

Human rights groups have critized Meta's approach to removing violent content during conflicts, saying its practice of purging the data from its servers after 90 days results in the deletion of critical evidence of war crimes.

Stone said Meta was ""exploring ways to preserve this type and other types of content when we remove it,"" specifically in relation to the war in Ukraine.

Russia has denied any accusations related to the murder of civilians.

65,META,2022-04-25,Facebook-owner Meta to open first physical store in metaverse bet,"













April 25 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) is set to open its first physical store where shoppers can try out and buy virtual reality headsets and other gadgets as the company plots a course to take its highly touted metaverse mainstream.

The 1,550-square feet Meta Store at the company's Burlingame campus in California opens on May 9, and will feature demos for its Quest 2 VR headset and video calling device Portal, as well as smart glasses it produces with Ray-Ban, Meta said on Monday.

The devices, except for the Ray-Ban glasses, will be available for purchase at the store. The products can also be bought online through a new shopping tab on meta.com, the company said.

Meta is investing heavily in the metaverse - a virtual space where people interact, work and play - by adding new features to hardware devices that serve as access points to the virtual world.

Earlier this month, the Facebook owner said it would start testing tools for selling digital assets and experiences within its virtual reality platform Horizon Worlds, a VR platform Meta launched late last year.

Meta also said it would charge a 47.5% fee from creators of digital experiences and assets, a move that has attracted criticism from some app developers. read more

Shoppers tracking the space are awaiting the next version of the Quest 2 VR headset, likely to be released in the second quarter and widely seen by analysts as critical to the company's metaverse plans.

66,META,2022-07-27,Meta posts first-ever revenue drop as inflation throttles ad sales,"













July 27 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) issued a gloomy forecast after recording its first ever quarterly drop in revenue on Wednesday, with recession fears and competitive pressures weighing on its digital ads sales.

Shares of the Menlo Park, California-based company were down about 4.6% in extended trading.

The company said it expects third-quarter revenue to fall to $26 billion and $28.5 billion, which would make it a second year-over-year drop in a row. Analysts were expecting $30.52 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Total revenue, which consists almost entirely of ad sales, fell 1% to $28.8 billion in the second quarter ended June 30, from $29.1 billion last year. The figure slightly missed Wall Street's projections of $28.9 billion, according to Refinitiv.

The company, which operates the world's largest social media platform, reported mixed results for user growth.

Monthly active users on flagship social network Facebook came in slightly under analyst expectations at 2.93 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 1% year over year, while daily active users handily beat estimates at 1.97 billion.

Like many global companies, Meta is facing some revenue pressure from the strong dollar, as sales in foreign currencies amount to less in dollar terms. Meta said it expected a 6% revenue growth headwind in the third quarter, based on current exchange rates.

Still, the Meta results also suggest that fortunes in online ads sales may be diverging between search and social media players, with the latter impacted more severely as ad buyers reel in spending.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), the world's largest digital ad platform, reported a rise in quarterly revenue on Tuesday, with sales from its biggest moneymaker - Google search - topping investor expectations. read more

Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and Twitter (TWTR.N) both missed sales expectations last week and warned of an ad market slowdown in coming quarters, sparking a broad sell-off across the sector. read more

On top of economic pressures, Meta's core business is also experiencing unique strain as it competes with short video app TikTok for users' time and adjusts its ads business to privacy controls rolled out by Apple Inc (AAPL.O) last year.

The company is simultaneously carrying out several expensive overhauls as a result, revamping its core apps and boosting its ad targeting with AI, while also investing heavily in a longer-term bet on ""metaverse"" hardware and software. read more

Meta executives told investors they were making progress in replacing ad dollars lost as a result of the Apple changes but said it was being offset by the economic slowdown.

They added that Reels, a short video product Meta is increasingly inserting into users' feeds to compete with TikTok, was now generating over $1 billion annually in revenue.

However, Reels cannibalizes more profitable content that users could otherwise see and will continue to be a headwind on profits through 2022 before eventually boosting income, executives told analysts on Wednesday.

""They are being greatly affected by everything,"" Bokeh Capital Partners' Kim Forrest said, referring to the economic slowdown as well as competition from TikTok and Apple.

""Meta has a problem because they're chasing TikTok and if the Kardashians are talking about how they don't like Instagram ... Meta should really pay attention to that.""

On Monday, two of Instagram's biggest users, Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner, both shared a meme imploring the company to abandon its shift to TikTok-style content suggestions and ""make Instagram Instagram again."" read more

CEO Mark Zuckerberg did not appear to be swayed, however.

About 15% of content on Facebook and Instagram is currently recommended by AI from accounts users do not actively follow, and that percentage will double by the end of 2023, he told investors on the call.

For now, at least, the metaverse part of Meta's business remains largely theoretical. In the second quarter, Meta reported $218 million in non-ad revenue, which includes payments fees and sales of devices like its Quest virtual reality headsets, down from $497 million last year.

Its Reality Labs unit, which is responsible for developing metaverse-oriented technology like the VR headsets, reported sales of $452 million, down from $695 million in the first quarter.

Although Meta has recently slowed investments as cost pressures increased, executives reassured investors it was still on track to release a mixed-reality headset called Project Cambria later this year, focused on professionals.

Meta broke out the Reality Labs segment in its results for the first time earlier this year, when it revealed the unit had lost $10.2 billion in 2021.

Its second-quarter operating profit margin fell to 29% from 43% as costs rose sharply and revenue dipped.

In November, Chief Financial Officer David Wehner will become Meta's first chief strategy officer. Susan Li, Meta's current vice president of finance, will become CFO.

67,META,2022-05-11,Facebook parent Meta partners with AMD for mobile infrastructure program,"













May 11 (Reuters) - Facebook parent, Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O), and chip maker AMD (AMD.O) on Wednesday said they were partnering for a mobile internet infrastructure program that would bring base station costs down to make broadband more accessible around the world.

The program, called Evenstar, was launched by Meta in early 2020 and promotes a platform called OpenRan that makes it possible for cellular network operators to mix and match hardware and software for building base stations instead of buying all of it from one equipment maker.

That gives operators more flexibility and makes equipment pricing more competitive, said Gilles Garcia, an executive with AMD's data center and communications group.

""They have a very aggressive target for the cost, because Meta is also trying to cover the uncovered regions and the underdeveloped countries. So they want to make sure there are more and more people connected,"" said Garcia.

AMD said its radio chip, Xilinx Zynq UltraScale RFSoC, will be used in the Evenstar radio units.

68,META,2022-12-08,Meta battles U.S. antitrust agency over future of virtual reality,"













SAN JOSE, Calif./ WASHINGTON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - The Biden administration on Thursday accused Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) of trying to buy its way to dominance in the metaverse, kicking off a high-profile trial to try to prevent the Facebook parent from buying virtual reality app developer Within Inc.

The FTC sued in July to stop the deal, saying Meta's acquisition of Within would ""tend to create a monopoly"" in the market for virtual reality (VR) fitness apps. It has asked the judge to order a preliminary injunction that would halt the proposed transaction.

In an opening statement, FTC lawyer Abby Dennis said the Within acquisition was part of Meta's bid to acquire new and more diverse virtual reality users, including customers of Within's popular subscription-based virtual reality workout app Supernatural.

That would complement Meta's existing virtual reality users, who tend to skew young and male, and be more focused on gaming, Dennis added.

""Meta could have chosen to use all its vast resources and capabilities to build its own dedicated VR fitness app, and it was planning on doing that before it acquired Within,"" Dennis said, pointing to a plan from early 2021.

The plan, Operation Twinkie, involved expanding a rhythm game app called Beat Saber that the company acquired in 2019 into the fitness space via a proposed partnership with digital fitness company Peloton (PTON.O), Dennis said.

She cited an email from Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg saying he was ""bullish"" on fitness and calling the proposed partnership with Peloton ""awesome.""

Lawyers for Meta and Within argued that the FTC did a poor job of defining the relevant market and said the companies compete with a range of fitness content, not just VR-dedicated fitness apps.

Meta's lawyers also disputed that plans for a Meta-owned VR fitness app had proceeded beyond low-level ""brainstorming"" and argued that the FTC underestimated the competition in the market it had defined, citing the potential for fellow tech giants Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Bytedance to join the fray.

Rade Stojsavljevic, who manages Meta's in-house VR app developer studios, testified that he had proposed the tie-up between Beat Saber and Peloton but did not develop a formal plan and never discussed the idea with either party.

Internal documents from early 2021 that were displayed in court showed Stojsavljevic proposing acquisitions of VR developers before they could be ""cannibalized"" by competitors and discussing pressure from Zuckerberg to ""get aggressive"" in response to reports of a prospective Apple headset.

The trial, scheduled through Dec. 20, will serve as a test of the FTC's bid to head off what it sees as a repeat of the company acquiring small upcoming would-be rivals and effectively buying its way to dominance, this time in the nascent virtual and augmented reality markets.

The FTC is separately trying to force Meta to unwind two previous acquisitions, Instagram and WhatsApp, in a lawsuit filed in 2020. Both were in relatively new markets at the time the companies were purchased.

PRESSURE TO PRODUCE HIT APPS

A government victory could crimp Meta's ability to maneuver in an area of emerging technology - virtual and augmented reality - that Zuckerberg has identified as the ""next generation of computing.""

If blocked from making acquisitions in the space, Meta would face greater pressure to produce its own hit apps and would give up the gains - in terms of revenue, talent, data and control - associated with bringing innovative developers in-house.

Within developed Supernatural, which it advertises as a ""complete fitness service"" with ""expert coaches,"" ""beautiful destinations"" and ""workouts choreographed to the best music available.""

It is available only on Meta's Quest devices, which are headsets offering immersive digital visuals and audio that market research firm IDC estimates capture 90% of global shipments in the virtual reality hardware market.

The majority of the more than 400 apps available in the Quest app store are produced by external developers. Meta owns the most popular virtual reality app in the Quest app store, Beat Saber, the app it was considering expanding with the Peloton partnership.

The social media company agreed to buy Within in October 2021, a day after changing its name from Facebook to Meta, signalling its ambition to build an immersive virtual environment known as the metaverse.

Zuckerberg will be a witness in the trial. Other potential witnesses are Within CEO Chris Milk and Meta Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth, who runs the company's metaverse-oriented Reality Labs unit.

The trial is at the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

69,META,2022-04-25,Meta fights to overturn UK order to sell Giphy,"[1/2] A woman holds a smartphone with Meta logo in front of Facebook's newly rebranded logo in this illustration picture taken October 28, 2021. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo















LONDON, April 25 (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta (FB.O) started its appeal on Monday against Britain's ruling that it must sell Giphy, arguing the fact that rival Snap offered far less to buy the animated-images provider undermined the rationale used to block the deal.

Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) last year ordered Meta to sell Giphy, which it had acquired in 2020.

It said the deal removed a potential competitor in display advertising, based on the possibility that Giphy's fledgling ads, or ""paid alignment"", business could become substantial.

The deal could also enable the Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp owner to restrict competitors' access to GIFs, it said.

The ruling - the first block of a major digital acquisition by the British regulator - signalled a step change in the scrutiny of ""big tech"". read more

On day one of a four-day hearing at the Competition Appeal Tribunal, Meta's lawyer Daniel Jowell said the CMA had withheld for 14 months the fact that Meta's rival Snap (SNAP.N) had made an informal offer to buy Giphy, valuing it internally at $142 million.

That was less than half the $315 million offered by Meta.

Snap's low valuation indicated that, like Meta, it believed Giphy's ads business did not have real potential, he said.

Jowell said the CMA did not ask Snap if it had attributed any value to Giphy's ad business - a procedural failure in itself - but it was clear it was ""not the motivation for Snap in having an interest in purchasing Giphy"".

Snap later acquired Gfycat, a competitor to Giphy.

Jowell said Giphy's revenue in the United States was less than 0.05% of Meta's ad revenue - ""literally minuscule"" - while Giphy sold no ads in Britain or elsewhere.

A Meta spokesperson said the information made public on Monday backed its argument that the deal promoted competition and improved choice.

""The decision to block the deal is wrong on the law and the facts, and the evidence does not support the CMA's conclusions or remedy,"" the spokesperson said.

The CMA said it would defend its decision ""vigorously"".

""This merger combined Meta's significant market power in display advertising and social media with Giphy's position as a leading provider of free GIFs and GIF stickers in the UK,"" a spokesperson said.

""By requiring Meta to sell Giphy, we are promoting competition and innovation in digital advertising and ensuring rival social media providers can get competitive access to Giphy's services – for the benefit of UK consumers.""

70,META,2022-08-26,Meta head of virtual reality platform Horizon leaving company,"













Aug 26 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc's chief of its virtual reality social platform Horizon, the main gateway for accessing the metaverse that the company is pouring billions of dollars into building, is leaving for a new opportunity, he told Reuters on Friday.

A spokesman for Facebook-owner Meta confirmed the departure of Vice President Vivek Sharma and said his team would report directly to Vishal Shah, vice president of Metaverse.

Sharma declined to elaborate.

Sharma was responsible for developing the persistent, immersive virtual environment that users experience when inside Meta's metaverse, primarily accessible via the company's virtual reality devices such as its Oculus headsets.

Although the business associated with the company's virtual worlds is still nascent, the aim is to make those worlds the main place where brands and third-party developers can reach Meta's user base if the metaverse takes off.

Platforms created by Sharma's team include Horizon Worlds, an expansive VR world-building platform, and Horizon Venues, which is focused on virtual events.

Horizon Workrooms, a virtual conferencing technology aimed at business customers, is run by Meta's enterprise-focused ""home and work"" division.

Sharma's departure comes on the heels of an embarrassing episode for Meta involving Horizon Worlds, in which critics mocked the graphics quality of Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's avatar after he posted a screenshot of it on Facebook.

Zuckerberg posted a second image days later showing a more sophisticated avatar. He acknowledged that the earlier image was ""pretty basic"" and promised ""major updates to Horizon and avatar graphics coming soon.""

Sharma, who has been with Meta for more than five years, was previously vice president of product for Facebook Gaming and Facebook Marketplace.

Summary

Summary Companies This content was produced in Russia where the law restricts coverage of Russian military operations in Ukraine















MOSCOW, June 20 (Reuters) - A Moscow court on Monday rejected an appeal brought by Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) after it was found guilty of ""extremist activity"" in Russia in March, the TASS news agency reported.

Russia restricted access to Meta's flagship platforms Facebook and Instagram, as well as fellow social network Twitter (TWTR.N), in the wake of Moscow sending tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, a move critics have cast as an effort by Russia to exert greater control over information flows.

Back in March, Russia said its extremism ruling would not affect Meta's WhatsApp messenger service, focusing instead on Facebook and Instagram. read more

Meta did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Lawyer Victoria Shakina in March told a court that Meta was not carrying out extremist activity and was against Russophobia.

Russia initially banned Facebook for restricting access to Russian media while Instagram was then targeted after Meta said it would allow social media users in Ukraine to post messages urging violence against Russian President Vladimir Putin and troops Moscow sent there.

Meta subsequently narrowed its guidance to prohibit calls for the death of a head of state and said its guidance should never be interpreted as condoning violence against Russians in general.

Russia has also objected to foreign platforms' treatment of its own media, some of which carry labels of being 'state-controlled'. State communications regulator Roskomnadzor has also regularly fined social media companies that fail to delete content Russia deems illegal.

A lawyer representing Meta on Monday told the court that refusing to block access to content and labelling state-controlled media were not activities that qualified as extremist, according to a Kommersant reporter in the courtroom.

Reuters could not independently verify that account and the lawyer could not immediately be reached.

The ruling caused some confusion in March because Meta's WhatsApp service remained available. Furthermore, prosecutors said that individuals would not be charged simply for using Meta's services, which are still accessible through virtual private networks (VPNs).

According to the ruling, when referring to Meta in the public sphere, organisations and individuals are required to include the disclaimer that Meta's activities are banned on Russian territory.

72,META,2023-02-22,Meta loses bid to toss $175 mln verdict in streaming patent case,"Companies Meta Platforms Inc Follow















Feb 22 (Reuters) - A federal judge in Austin, Texas on Tuesday rejected a request by Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) to throw out a $175 million jury patent verdict for walkie-talkie app maker Voxer Inc.

U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel's decision leaves intact the jury's finding that Meta's Facebook Live and Instagram Live live-streaming technology infringed two Voxer patents related to video streaming and messaging. Meta can still appeal the verdict to a higher court.

Representatives for Meta and Voxer did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday.

San Francisco-based Voxer's 2020 lawsuit said its representatives disclosed its patented technology to Meta, which was then Facebook, when the companies met in 2012 about a potential collaboration.

Voxer said Facebook cut it off from key features of the social media platform in 2013 and misused its technology in Facebook Live and Instagram Live, which launched in 2015 and 2016.

A jury found last September that Meta infringed the two patents, which relate to a method for streaming video and infrastructure for a video-messaging service, and awarded Voxer $174.5 million in royalty damages.

Meta asked the court to overturn the verdict or hold a new trial. It raised several arguments, including that a reasonable jury could not have found infringement, the patents were invalid, the damages were unjustified, and Voxer's lawyer had made ""inappropriate comments"" that biased the jury against Meta.

Yeakel denied Meta's requests Tuesday and said there was enough evidence to support the jury's verdict.

The case is Voxer Inc v. Meta Platforms Inc, U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, No. 1:20-cv-00655.

73,META,2022-08-05,Meta Platforms agrees to delay closing Within deal given U.S. challenge,"













WASHINGTON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms (META.O), the parent of Facebook which is making a big play for virtual reality, has agreed to delay closing its deal for Within Unlimited, maker of the popular fitness app ""Supernatural,"" according to a court filing.

The Federal Trade Commission had filed a lawsuit seeking to stop the deal in July, and had asked a judge in federal court in San Francisco for a temporary restraining order stopping the companies from closing the deal. read more

In a joint court filing on Thursday, Meta agreed not to close until 11:59 p.m. on Dec. 31 or until the first business day after the judge decides whether the case may go forward.

The FTC, which voted 3-2 on whether to file the lawsuit, called Facebook a ""global technology behemoth,"" noting its ownership of popular apps including Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, and said its ""campaign to conquer VR"" began in 2014 when it acquired Oculus, a VR headset manufacture

Facebook, which agreed to buy Within in October 2021 for an undisclosed sum, said when the lawsuit was filed that the FTC case was ""based on ideology and speculation, not evidence.""

The FTC argued in its complaint that the planned acquisition was a way for Meta to dominate virtual reality.

Meta already has the best-selling VR headset, the Quest 2, and controls a Meta Quest Store with hundreds of apps. Within, founded in 2014, creates original content for virtual reality. It describes itself as ""the premier destination for cinematic virtual reality.""

74,META,2022-10-26,Meta stock craters over bleak forecast and expensive metaverse bets,"













Oct 26 (Reuters) - Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) on Wednesday forecast a weak holiday quarter and significantly more costs next year, sending shares down nearly 20% as investors voiced skepticism about the company's pricey metaverse bets.

The forecast knocked about $67 billion off Meta's stock market value in extended trade, adding to the more than half a trillion dollars in value already lost this year.

If Meta's after-hours stock rout is matched in Thursday's trading session, it will have been its deepest one-day loss since Feb. 2, when the company last issued a dismal forecast.

The disappointing outlook comes as Meta is contending with slowing global economic growth, competition from TikTok, privacy changes from Apple (AAPL.O), concerns about massive spending on the metaverse and the ever-present threat of regulation.

Executives announced plans to consolidate offices and said Meta would keep headcount flat through the end of 2023.

Revenue fell 4% in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. That deepened a revenue decline begun the previous quarter, when the company posted a first-ever revenue drop of 0.9%, although it was less steep than the 5.6% decline Wall Street had expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

More troubling was the company's estimate that fourth-quarter revenue would be in the range of $30 billion to $32.5 billion, mostly under analysts' estimates of $32.2 billion, according to the Refinitiv data.

Meta also forecast that its full-year 2023 total expenses would be $96 billion to $101 billion, significantly higher than a revised estimate for 2022 total expenses of $85 billion to $87 billion.

That includes an estimated $2.9 billion in charges over the course of both 2022 and 2023 from the office downsizing.

It also forecast that operating losses associated with the Reality Labs unit responsible for its metaverse investments would grow in 2023 and pledged to ""pace"" investments after that.

Total costs for the third quarter came in above estimates at $22.1 billion, compared with $18.6 billion the year prior.

'EXPERIMENTAL BETS'

Meta is carrying out several overhauls of its apps and ads products to keep its core business pumping out profits, while also investing $10 billion a year in a bet on metaverse hardware and software.

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has said he expects the metaverse investments to take about a decade to bear fruit. In the meantime, he has had to freeze hiring, shutter projects and reorganize teams to trim costs.

An analyst on the investor call told Zuckerberg investors were worried that the company had taken on ""just too many experimental bets"" and asked the chief executive why he believed his gambles would pay off.

Meta executives defended the spending, saying most of the company's expenses were still going toward the core business, including investments in more expensive AI-related servers, infrastructure and data centers.

Zuckerberg added that he expected the metaverse work to provide returns over time.

""I appreciate the patience,"" he said. ""And I think that those who are patient and invest with us will end up being rewarded.""

Zuckerberg said plays of Meta's TikTok-like short-video product Reels now number more than 140 billion across Facebook and Instagram each day, up 50% from six months ago, and its revenue run rates are now $3 billion annually.

He believes Reels is gaining against rival TikTok, he added, with Reels being reshared more than 1 billion times a day.

Meta also posted user growth figures roughly in line with expectations, including a year-over-year increase of monthly active users on flagship app Facebook.

""The worry for Meta is that this pain is likely to continue into 2023 as cost headwinds remain a real challenge and the strong dollar impacts on overseas earnings,"" said Ben Barringer, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot.

""Given revenues were down at a time when costs have grown significantly, modest user growth and impressions simply isn't going to bail you out.""

Net income in the third quarter fell to $4.40 billion, or $1.64 per share, from $9.19 billion, or $3.22 per share, a year earlier, its worst showing since 2019 and the fourth straight quarter of profit decline.

Analysts had expected a profit of $1.86 per share.

75,META,2023-03-13,Meta to wind down NFTs on platforms amid crypto bust,"













March 13 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) is cutting off support for digital collectibles or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on its platforms less than a year after rolling it out, as the crypto market continues to spiral.

""We're winding down digital collectibles (NFTs) for now to focus on other ways to support creators, people, and businesses,"" the social media firm's fintech head, Stephane Kasriel, tweeted on Monday.

The company rolled out support for creators to share NFTs on Instagram and Facebook last year, when the speculative crypto asset had exploded in popularity, with sales of cartoon apes to video clips touching billions of dollars.

But bitcoin and other tokens took a beating in late 2022 after major exchange FTX crashed into sudden bankruptcy.

The downfall was worsened by last week's collapse of three U.S. banks, two of which were crypto-focused.

""We'll continue investing in fintech tools that people and businesses will need for the future. We're streamlining payments w/ Meta Pay, making checkout and payouts easier, and investing in messaging payments across Meta,"" Kasriel said.

76,META,2022-05-11,Meta withdraws Ukraine war content policy guidance request,"













May 11 (Reuters) - Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) said on Wednesday it has withdrawn a request for policy guidance from its Oversight Board about the content moderation of posts related to Russia's ongoing war with Ukraine.

""This decision was not made lightly — the PAO (policy advisory opinion) was withdrawn due to ongoing safety and security concerns,"" the company said in a blog post.

The board, which can make binding decisions on specific thorny content moderation appeals and give policy recommendations, said it was ""disappointed"" by the decision.

A Meta spokesman declined to give more information about the policies on which it was seeking guidance or about the specific concerns.

Russia banned Facebook and Instagram in March, finding Meta guilty of ""extremist activity"" amid Moscow's crackdown on social media during its invasion of Ukraine. Meta's messaging service WhatsApp is not affected by the ban. Russia has also throttled Twitter (TWTR.N) by slowing its service.

Meta's Oversight Board, which includes academics, rights experts and lawyers, was created by the company as an independent body to rule on a small portion of content moderation cases, but it can also advise on site policies.

""While the Board understands these concerns, we believe the request raises important issues and are disappointed by the company's decision to withdraw it,"" the Oversight Board said in tweets on Wednesday.

""The importance for the company to defend freedom of expression and human rights has only increased.""

Summary Companies This content was produced in Russia where the law restricts coverage of Russian military operations in Ukraine















MOSCOW, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Russia's financial monitoring agency, Rosfinmonitoring, has added U.S. tech giant Meta Platforms Inc. (META.O) to its list of ""terrorists and extremists"", Russian news agencies reported on Tuesday.

A Moscow court in June rejected an appeal by Meta - owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp - after it was found guilty of ""extremist activity"" in Russia in March. In court, Meta's lawyer at the time said Meta was not carrying out extremist activity and was against Russophobia.

Meta did not reply to an emailed request for comment on Tuesday.

Rosfinmonitoring's list concerns ""organisations and individuals with regard to which there is information about their involvement in extremist activities or terrorism"".

Moscow has restricted access to Facebook and Instagram, although many Russian users still access them using virtual private networks (VPNs), demand for which skyrocketed as some Western internet services were blocked in March.

State communications regulator Roskomnadzor has updated its list of banned VPNs, TASS news agency reported on Tuesday. It began trying to block VPNs in 2021, though many continue to work.

Officials have regularly said Meta's ""extremist"" tag does not extend to its WhatsApp messenger service.

""Rosfinmonitoring's decision to put Meta on the list of extremist organisations in no way changes the situation for users of Meta's social networks, users of Meta products are not breaking the law,"" senior lawmaker Andrey Klishas wrote on Telegram on Tuesday.

""There are no restrictions in relation to WhatsApp messenger,"" he added.

Lawyers and digital rights groups have, however, reported that Facebook and Instagram users are being warned over some posts.

Human rights lawyer Pavel Chikov has warned that simply displaying the Instagram and Facebook logos, or advertising on those networks, could be deemed illegal under Russia's criminal code.

Law firms Related documents Epidemic Sound said Meta unlawfully distributed hundreds of tracks

Court rejects Meta argument that Epidemic failed to detail ""basic facts""















(Reuters) - A San Francisco federal judge on Monday denied a request by Meta Platforms Inc to throw out a lawsuit filed by a Swedish music label that claims Meta infringed thousands of its copyrights through Facebook and Instagram.

Meta did not show that Epidemic Sound AB's allegations were too speculative to support its complaint, a San Francisco federal court said Monday.

Representatives for the companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Epidemic said it owns and distributes more than 38,000 pieces of royalty-free music for creators to use in videos, podcasts and other content. Epidemic sued Meta in July for allegedly reproducing at least 950 tracks in its music library for Facebook and Instagram users to download, stream and incorporate into videos without the label's permission.

Epidemic requested at least $142 million in damages from Meta for allegedly distributing its music through ""millions"" of user videos that have been seen ""billions"" of times.

Meta told the court in September that the lawsuit should be dismissed because Epidemic had not identified ""even a single allegedly infringing copy"" of its music ""on a Meta property,"" and had not included other ""basic facts"" about the supposed violations.

But U.S. District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley denied Meta's motion on Monday, finding Epidemic's complaint was detailed enough to justify continuing the case.

The case is Epidemic Sound AB v. Meta Platforms Inc, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 3:22-cv-04223.

81,META,2022-10-18,Meta accepts UK order to sell Giphy after antitrust battle,"













LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Britain's competition regulator has ordered Facebook-owner Meta (META.O) to sell animated-images platform Giphy on Tuesday after a tribunal upheld its view that the acquisition could damage its rivals and remove a potential competitor in advertising.

Meta said it would accept the Competition and Markets Authority's (CMA) order to unwind the 2020 deal.

""We are disappointed by the CMA's decision but accept today's ruling as the final word on the matter,"" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement. ""We will work closely with the CMA on divesting Giphy.""

The ruling was the first time a regulator had forced a U.S. tech giant to sell an already acquired company, and signalled a new determination to scrutinise digital deals.

Regulators around the world have been increasingly being proactive in reining in big companies.

U.S. antitrust regulators had, earlier in October, filed a lawsuit against Meta's acquisition of virtual reality content maker Within Unlimited Inc, saying it would ""tend to create a monopoly"" in the market for VR-dedicated fitness apps. read more

The European Union has been at the forefront of this battle against tech giants, setting up landmark antitrust and privacy rules and doling out billions of dollars in fines to force changes in their business models.

The British regulator had blocked the Giphy deal, valued at a reported $400 million, in November 2021 on concerns that Meta could deny or limit competitors such as Snapchat and Twitter access to Giphy's GIFs.

It was also worried about the loss of a potential competitor in display advertising, even though Giphy had no presence in the sector in Britain.

The CMA had noted that UK users look for 1 billion GIFs a month on Giphy, and 73% of the time they spend on social media was on Meta's Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. read more

Meta appealed the ruling, but a tribunal upheld the CMA's decision on five out of six grounds in June.

The CMA said it had considered new submissions from Meta and Giphy and additional evidence since the appeal, but had not changed its view.

""This deal would significantly reduce competition in two markets,"" said Stuart McIntosh, chair of an independent inquiry group.

""It has already resulted in the removal of a potential challenger in the UK display ad market, while also giving Meta the ability to further increase its substantial market power in social media.""

""The only way this can be addressed is by the sale of Giphy,"" he added.

BRUSSELS, April 28 (Reuters) - The European Union's top court ruled on Thursday that Germany's consumer protection association could bring a legal challenge against Facebook parent Meta (FB.O) over data privacy.

The Court of Justice of the European Union's (CJEU) verdict means that the Federation of German Consumer Organisations (and Associations (Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband) can seek an injunction against Meta Platforms Ireland in a German court.

The federation alleges that Meta infringed rules on data privacy, unfair competition and consumer protection related to free games by third parties available to Facebook users.

The gaming companies obtained certain personal data in the process.

""The underlying legal proceedings showed that there were some open questions, which the CJEU has now addressed. We will review the decision and assess its implications,” a Meta spokesperson said.

The German court referred the case to the CJEU, asking if, under EU law on data protection that came into force in 2018, a consumer body could still take legal action over data privacy infringements or whether this was now a matter only for national supervisory authorities.

The CJEU noted that the German court had found the legal action well-founded, although questioning its admissibility.

The EU court ruled that the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) did not preclude national legislation allowing consumer protection associations to bring legal proceedings.

It also said a consumer association, such as the German federation, counted as a body that could bring proceedings related to GDPR because it was acting in the public's interest.

It could also bring such action without having to identify the person or people whose rights had been infringed.

84,META,2022-12-06,EU set to bar Meta from ads based on personal data,"













BRUSSELS/BANGALORE, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Meta (META.O) will only be able to run advertising based on personal data with users' consent, according to a confidential EU privacy watchdog decision, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, in a blow to the U.S. social network.

The Irish data protection agency, which oversees Meta because its European headquarters is located in Dublin, has been given a month to issue a ruling based on the European Data Protection Board's (EDPB) binding decision.

The EDPB will likely require the Irish body to hand out fines, the person said, asking not to be named because of the senstivity of the issue.

Big Tech's targeted ad model and how data is collected and used has drawn regulatory scrutiny around the world.

Shares of the company were down 6.2% in mid-session trade. Google (GOOGL.O), Snap (SNAP.N) and Pinterest (PINS.N) which are reliant on digital advertising, fell 2.2%, 8% and 4% respectively.

The Irish case against Meta was triggered by a complaint by Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems in 2018.

""Instead of having a yes/no option for personalised ads, they just moved the consent clause in the terms and conditions. This is not just unfair but clearly illegal. We are not aware of any other company that has tried to ignore the GDPR in such an arrogant way,"" Schrems said in a statement.

He said the EDPB's ruling means that Meta must allow users to have a version of all apps that do not use personal data for ads while the company would still be allowed to use non-personal data to personalise ads or simply ask users for consent.

The 27-country bloc's landmark privacy rules known as the General Data Protection Regulation went into effect in 2018.

Meta is engaging with the Irish body, a Meta spokesperson said.

""GDPR allows for a range of legal bases under which data can be processed, beyond consent or performance of a contract. Under the GDPR there is no hierarchy between these legal bases, and none should be considered better than any other,"" the spokesperson said.

Apple's (AAPL.O) new privacy rules, which limit digital advertisers from tracking iPhone users, have also been a blow to the Facebook parent.

An EDPB spokeswoman declined to provide details of the decisions made. The agency said it stepped in after other national watchdogs disagreed with the Irish agency's draft decision.

Its draft decisions on Meta's parent Facebook and Instagram focus on the lawfulness and transparency of processing for behavioural advertising, while its decision on WhatsApp concerns the lawfulness of processing for the purpose of the improvement of services.

""The DPC cannot comment on the contents of the decisions at this point. We have one month to adopt the EDPB's binding decisions and will publish details then,"" the Irish Data Protection Commission said.

Meta may have to change its business model, said Helena Brown, head of data & privacy at London-based law firm Addleshaw Goddard.

""The direction of travel seems to be that the European regulators will not allow Meta to hide behind ""provision of services"" as its basis for using personal data for behavioural advertising,"" she said.

""Instead, Meta may need to change its approach to seeking clear, explicit consent instead. It will be a challenge for Meta to be able to explain its practices in a way that such consent can be lawful and well-informed,"" Brown said.

The WSJ first reported on the EDPB ruling.

85,META,2022-05-11,Exclusive: Facebook-owner Meta tells hardware staffers to prepare for cutbacks,"













May 11 (Reuters) - Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) is preparing cutbacks in its Reality Labs division, a unit at the center of the company's strategy to refocus on hardware products and the ""metaverse,"" a spokesperson confirmed to Reuters on Wednesday.

Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth told Reality Labs staffers during a weekly Q&A session on Tuesday to expect the changes to be announced within a week, according to a summary of his comments viewed by Reuters.

The Meta spokesperson confirmed that Bosworth told staffers the division could not afford to do some projects anymore and would have to postpone others, without specifying which projects would be affected.

She said Meta was not planning layoffs as part of the changes.

The world's biggest social media company last month told investors that it would scale back costs in 2022, following a drop in Facebook users early this year that caused the stock to plunge. read more

In an earnings call in late April, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said Meta planned to ""slow the pace"" of some longer-term investments in areas like its business platform, artificial intelligence infrastructure and Reality Labs.

Meta lowered its expected 2022 total expenses to between $87 billion and $92 billion, down from its prior outlook of between $90 billion and $95 billion. Last week, it told employees it was reducing hiring for most mid-to-senior-level positions, as initially reported by Insider.

The 18-year-old tech giant has invested heavily in Reality Labs, which grew out of its Oculus virtual reality business and now encompasses work on augmented reality, smart glasses, Portal video-calling devices and enterprise tech solutions.

The unit is also building a mixed reality headset with face and eye tracking called Project Cambria, which Zuckerberg previewed in a post on his Facebook page on Wednesday.

Those investments are aimed at positioning Meta as a gateway to the metaverse, a universe of immersive, shared, interconnected digital worlds which Zuckerberg has said he believes will be the successor to the mobile internet.

The company changed its name in October to reflect its metaverse aims and has hired extensively to staff Reality Labs, adding more than 13,000 employees last year and nearly 6,000 in the first quarter this year.

At the same time, Zuckerberg has warned that it may take about a decade for the metaverse bets to pay off, and Reality Labs has bled cash. The unit lost $10.2 billion in 2021 and another $3 billion in the first quarter this year.

Zuckerberg told investors last month that he still aims over the next several years to generate enough income growth from legacy apps Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp to fund investments in Reality Labs, while continuing to grow profits overall.

""Unfortunately, that's not going to happen in 2022,"" he said.

86,META,2022-06-30,"Exclusive: Meta slashes hiring plans, girds for 'fierce' headwinds","













June 30 (Reuters) - Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) has cut plans to hire engineers by at least 30% this year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees on Thursday, as he warned them to brace for a deep economic downturn.

""If I had to bet, I'd say that this might be one of the worst downturns that we've seen in recent history,"" Zuckerberg told workers in a weekly employee Q&A session, audio of which was heard by Reuters.

Meta has reduced its target for hiring engineers in 2022 to around 6,000-7,000, down from an initial plan to hire about 10,000 new engineers, Zuckerberg said.

Meta confirmed hiring pauses in broad terms last month, but exact figures have not previously been reported.

In addition to reducing hiring, he said, the company was leaving certain positions unfilled in response to attrition and ""turning up the heat"" on performance management to weed out staffers unable to meet more aggressive goals.

""Realistically, there are probably a bunch of people at the company who shouldn't be here,"" Zuckerberg said.

""Part of my hope by raising expectations and having more aggressive goals, and just kind of turning up the heat a little bit, is that I think some of you might decide that this place isn't for you, and that self-selection is OK with me,"" he said.

The social media and technology company is bracing for a leaner second half of the year, as it copes with macroeconomic pressures and data privacy hits to its ads business, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Thursday.

The company must ""prioritize more ruthlessly"" and ""operate leaner, meaner, better executing teams,"" Chief Product Officer Chris Cox wrote in the memo, which appeared on the company's internal discussion forum Workplace before the Q&A.

""I have to underscore that we are in serious times here and the headwinds are fierce. We need to execute flawlessly in an environment of slower growth, where teams should not expect vast influxes of new engineers and budgets,"" Cox wrote.

The memo was ""intended to build on what we've already said publicly in earnings about the challenges we face and the opportunities we have, where we're putting more of our energy toward addressing,"" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement.

The guidance is the latest rough forecast to come from Meta executives, who already moved to trim costs across much of the company this year in the face of slowing ad sales and user growth. read more

Tech companies across the board have scaled back their ambitions in anticipation of a possible U.S. recession, although the slide in stock price at Meta has been more severe than at competitors Apple (AAPL.O) and Google (GOOGL.O).

The world's biggest social media company lost about half its market value this year, after Meta reported that daily active users on its flagship Facebook app had experienced a quarterly decline for the first time. read more

Its austerity drive comes at a tricky time, coinciding with two major strategic pivots: one aimed at re-fashioning its social media products around ""discovery"" to beat back competition from short-video app TikTok, the other an expensive long-term bet on augmented and virtual reality technology.

In his memo, Cox said Meta would need to increase fivefold the number of graphic processing units (GPUs) in its data centers by the end of the year to support the ""discovery"" push, which requires extra computing power for artificial intelligence to surface popular posts from across Facebook and Instagram in users' feeds.

Interest in Meta's TikTok-style short video product Reels was growing quickly, said Cox, with users doubling the amount of time they were spending on Reels year over year, both in the United States and globally.

Some 80% of the growth since March came from Facebook, he added.

That user engagement with Reels could provide a key route to bolster the bottom line, making it important to boost ads in Reels ""as quickly as possible,"" he added.

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told investors in April that executives viewed Reels as ""a major part of the discovery engine vision,"" but at the time described the short video shift as a ""short-term headwind"" that would increase revenue gradually as advertisers became more comfortable with the format.

Cox said Meta also saw possibilities for revenue growth in business messaging and in-app shopping tools, the latter of which, he added, could ""mitigate signal loss"" created by Apple-led privacy changes.

He said the company's hardware division was ""laser-focused"" on successfully launching its mixed-reality headset, code-named ""Cambria,"" in the second half of the year.

87,META,2022-04-27,Facebook-owner Meta heads for dismal quarter as advertisers unfriend,"













April 27 (Reuters) - Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) is expected to report its slowest quarterly ad revenue growth in a decade on Wednesday, as businesses pull back on ad spending against the backdrop of soaring inflation worldwide and the war in Ukraine.

Global advertising and marketing budgets will be strained further if the Ukraine crisis drags on in the coming months, with some analysts predicting that Meta will also issue a tepid forecast for the current quarter.

Meta's ad revenue is expected to have grown 8.7% in the first quarter, according to Refinitiv data, the slowest since 2012, when the company went public.

Wall Street analysts also said Facebook could be losing its grip on the global ad market even as digital advertising surpasses traditional methods.

""The predictions by Meta for a slowdown could be read as a reduction in the Facebook's brand potency as well,"" Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Sophie Lund-Yates said.

Meta has lost nearly half its market value since Feb. 2, when it reported a decline in Facebook's daily active users for the first time and forecast a gloomy quarter. read more

THE CONTEXT

Google-parent Alphabet provided a cue on Tuesday, when it cited the war in Ukraine for slowing YouTube ad sales. Smaller rival Snap Inc (SNAP.N) warned that inflation, labor shortages and other economic challenges could pressure ad revenue.

The timing could not have been worse for tech firms reliant on ad revenues as they are also grappling with policy changes in Apple's App Store and growing competition for ad dollars from companies like TikTok.

""The cost to acquire customers on digital channels like Facebook has increased while the ability to target customers has decreased,"" said Mitchell Olsen, assistant professor of marketing at the University of Notre Dame.

As a result, many brand managers are reducing their exposure to Facebook and reallocating their ad dollars across various platforms, Olsen added.

88,META,2022-05-05,"Facebook-owner Meta gives preview of its first store, enterprise tools","













BURLINGAME, CALIFORNIA May 4 (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) on Wednesday gave an early glimpse of its first physical store, which features a floor-to-ceiling screen for showing off games on its virtual reality headsets and rooms for testing video calling devices.

The store, set to open on May 9, is located at the main campus for Meta's Reality Labs unit, in the Silicon Valley town of Burlingame, California. The unit is developing the hardware products the company aims to sell there, including Ray-Ban smart glasses, Portal video-calling devices and Oculus VR headsets.

With blonde wood and minimalist decor, the store design echoes the aesthetic pioneered by Apple Inc (AAPL.O) when it set up retail stores more than two decades ago.

The opening of the Meta store makes tangible what is largely a theoretical future business for the world's largest social media company, which has invested heavily in virtual and augmented reality in a push to build the ""metaverse,"" a term used to describe immersive, shared virtual spaces.

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg says the metaverse could be the world's next big computing platform, but he has warned that it may take about a decade for the company's bets to pay off.

In the meantime, with growth slowing and the company still almost entirely reliant on digital ads for revenue, Meta is cutting back on some of its long-term investments. read more

In addition to promoting its hardware devices to consumers, Meta is increasingly pitching them to businesses. It gave a demonstration at the store of conference calls that can feature a mix of virtual reality avatars and traditional video calling.

The company is experimenting with augmented reality technology that would enable users to join conferences as avatars via Portal, without donning headsets, said Micah Collins, a director of product management working on the enterprise tools.

Collins acknowledged the enterprise metaverse business is nascent, and a spokesperson said most usage of Horizon Workrooms, the VR conferencing technology, comes from inside Meta.

Still, Collins said, the company senses opportunity.

Although many products are still very early stage and known in their consumer context, ""there's enough there that's giving us a lot of confidence to attack the space,"" he said.

89,META,2022-04-11,How Meta fumbled propaganda moderation during Russia's invasion of Ukraine,"[1/2] Meta logo is placed on a Russian flag in this illustration taken February 26, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo















April 11(Reuters) - Days after the March 9 bombing of a maternity and children's hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, comments claiming the attack never happened began flooding the queues of workers moderating Facebook and Instagram content on behalf of the apps' owner, Meta Platforms (FB.O).

The bombardment killed at least three people, including a child, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said publicly. Images of bloodied, heavily pregnant women fleeing through the rubble, their hands cradling their bellies, sparked immediate outrage worldwide. read more

Among the most-recognized women was Mariana Vishegirskaya, a Ukrainian fashion and beauty influencer. Photos of her navigating down a hospital stairwell in polka-dot pajamas circulated widely after the attack, captured by an Associated Press photographer.

Online expressions of support for the mother-to-be quickly turned to attacks on her Instagram account, according to two contractors directly moderating content from the conflict on Facebook and Instagram. They spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, citing non-disclosure agreements that barred them from discussing their work publicly.

The case involving the beauty influencer is just one example of how Meta's content policies and enforcement mechanisms have enabled pro-Russian propaganda during the Ukraine invasion, the moderators told Reuters.

Russian officialdom seized on the images, setting them side-by-side against her glossy Instagram photos in an effort to persuade viewers that the attack had been faked. On state television and social media, and in the chamber of the U.N. Security Council, Moscow alleged - falsely - that Vishegirskaya had donned make-up and multiple outfits in an elaborately staged hoax orchestrated by Ukrainian forces.

Swarms of comments accusing the influencer of duplicity and being an actress appeared underneath old Instagram posts of her posed with tubes of makeup, the moderators said.

At the height of the onslaught, comments containing false allegations about the woman accounted for most of the material in one moderator's content queue, which normally would have contained a mix of posts suspected of violating Meta's myriad policies, the person recalled.

""The posts were vile,"" and appeared to be orchestrated, the moderator told Reuters. But many were within the company's rules, the person said, because they did not directly mention the attack. ""I couldn't do anything about them,"" the moderator said.

Reuters was unable to contact Vishegirskaya.

Meta declined to comment on its handling of the activity involving Vishegirskaya, but said in a statement to Reuters that multiple teams are addressing the issue.

""We have separate, expert teams and outside partners that review misinformation and inauthentic behavior and we have been applying our policies to counter that activity forcefully throughout the war,"" the statement said.

Meta policy chief Nick Clegg separately told reporters on Wednesday that the company was considering new steps to address misinformation and hoaxes from Russian government pages, without elaborating. read more

Russia's Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media and the Kremlin did not respond to requests for comment.

Representatives of Ukraine did not respond to a request for comment.

'SPIRIT OF THE POLICY'

Based at a moderation hub of several hundred people reviewing content from Eastern Europe, the two contractors are foot soldiers in Meta's battle to police content from the conflict. They are among tens of thousands of low-paid workers at outsourcing firms around the world that Meta contracts to enforce its rules.

The tech giant has sought to position itself as a responsible steward of online speech during the invasion, which Russia calls a ""special operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its neighbor.

Just a few days into the war, Meta imposed restrictions on Russian state media and took down a small network of coordinated fake accounts that it said were trying to undermine trust in the Ukrainian government. read more

It later said it had pulled down another Russia-based network that was falsely reporting people for violations like hate speech or bullying, while beating back attempts by previously disabled networks to return to the platform.

Meanwhile, the company attempted to carve out space for users in the region to express their anger over Russia’s invasion and to issue calls to arms in ways Meta normally would not permit.

In Ukraine and 11 other countries across Eastern Europe and the Caucasus, it created a series of temporary ""spirit of the policy"" exemptions to its rules barring hate speech, violent threats and more; the changes were intended to honor the general principles of those policies rather than their literal wording, according to Meta instructions to moderators seen by Reuters.

For example, it permitted ""dehumanizing speech against Russian soldiers"" and calls for death to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his ally Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, unless those calls were considered credible or contained additional targets, according to the instructions viewed by Reuters.

The changes became a flashpoint for Meta as it navigated pressures both inside the company and from Moscow, which opened a criminal case into the firm after a March 10 Reuters report made the carve-outs public. Russia also banned Facebook and Instagram inside its borders, with a court accusing Meta of ""extremist activity."" read more

Meta walked back elements of the exceptions after the Reuters report. It first limited them to Ukraine alone and then canceled one altogether, according to documents reviewed by Reuters, Meta's public statements, and interviews with two Meta staffers, the two moderators in Europe and a third moderator who handles English-language content in another region who had seen the advisories.

The documents offer a rare lens into how Meta interprets its policies, called community standards. The company says its system is neutral and rule-based.

Critics say it is often reactive, driven as much by business considerations and news cycles as by principle. It’s a complaint that has dogged Meta in other global conflicts including Myanmar, Syria and Ethiopia. Social media researchers say the approach allows the company to escape accountability for how its policies affect the 3.6 billion users of its services.

The shifting guidance over Ukraine has generated confusion and frustration for moderators, who say they have 90 seconds on average to decide whether a given post violates policy, as first reported by the New York Times. Reuters independently confirmed such frustrations with three moderators.

After Reuters reported the exemptions on March 10, Meta policy chief Nick Clegg said in a statement the next day that Meta would allow such speech only in Ukraine.

Two days later, Clegg told employees the company was reversing altogether the exemption that had allowed users to call for the deaths of Putin and Lukashenko, according to a March 13 internal company post seen by Reuters.

At the end of March, the company extended the remaining Ukraine-only exemptions through April 30, the documents show. Reuters is the first to report this extension, which allows Ukrainians to continue engaging in certain types of violent and dehumanizing speech that normally would be off-limits.

Inside the company, writing on an internal social platform, some Meta employees expressed frustration that Facebook was allowing Ukrainians to make statements that would have been deemed out of bounds for users posting about previous conflicts in the Middle East and other parts of the world, according to copies of the messages viewed by Reuters.

""Seems this policy is saying hate speech and violence is ok if it is targeting the 'right' people,"" one employee wrote, one of 900 comments on a post about the changes.

Meanwhile, Meta gave moderators no guidance to enhance their ability to disable posts promoting false narratives about Russia's invasion, like denials that civilian deaths have occurred, the people told Reuters.

The company declined to comment on its guidance to moderators.

DENYING VIOLENT TRAGEDIES

In theory, Meta did have a rule that should have enabled moderators to address the mobs of commenters directing baseless vitriol at Vishegirskaya, the pregnant beauty influencer. She survived the Mariupol hospital bombing and delivered her baby, the Associated Press reported.

Meta's harassment policy prohibits users from ""posting content about a violent tragedy, or victims of violent tragedies that include claims that a violent tragedy did not occur,"" according to the Community Standards published on its website. It cited that rule when it removed posts by the Russian Embassy in London that had pushed false claims about the Mariupol bombing following the March 9 attack. read more

But because the rule is narrowly defined, two of the moderators said, it could be used only sparingly to battle the online hate campaign against the beauty influencer that followed.

Posts that explicitly alleged that the bombing was staged were eligible for removal, but comments such as ""you're such a good actress"" were considered too vague and had to stay up, even when the subtext was clear, they said.

Guidance from Meta enabling commenters to consider context and enforce the spirit of that policy could have helped, they added.

Meta declined to comment on whether the rule applied to the comments on Vishegirskaya's account.

At the same time, even explicit posts proved elusive to Meta's enforcement systems.

A week after the bombing, versions of the Russian Embassy posts were still circulating on at least eight official Russian accounts on Facebook, including its embassies in Denmark, Mexico and Japan, according to an Israeli watchdog organization, FakeReporter. read more

One showed a red ""fake"" label laid over the Associated Press photos of Mariupol, with text claiming the attack on Vishegirskaya was a hoax, and pointing readers to ""more than 500 comments from real users"" on her Instagram account condemning her for participating in the alleged ruse.

Meta removed those posts on March 16, hours after Reuters asked the company about them, a spokesperson confirmed. Meta declined to comment on why the posts had evaded its own detection systems.

The following day, on March 17, Meta designated Vishegirskaya an ""involuntary public person,"" which meant moderators could finally start deleting the comments under the company's bullying and harassment policy, they told Reuters.

But the change, they said, came too late. The flow of posts related to the woman had already slowed to a trickle.

May 26 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) on Thursday said it was working on restoring Instagram, after thousands of users reported issues with accessing the image-sharing platform.

At its peak, more than 6,600 users reported issues with Instagram on Downdetector.com, which collates status reports on outages from sources including user-submitted errors. The outage may be affecting a larger number of users.

According to the website, 84% of reports flagged trouble with accessing the Instagram mobile application.

91,META,2023-02-22,Italy pursues Facebook-owner Meta for $925 million in sales taxes,"













MILAN, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Facebook parent company Meta (META.O) faces a potential tax bill of around 870 million euros ($925 million) in Italy after prosecutors launched an investigation into the company, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.

The investigation was opened by Milan magistrates at the request of the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO), which asked the Guardia di Finanza police and the Italian Revenue Agency to checks if there is a case for user registrations to be subject to tax.

""We strongly disagree with the idea that providing access to online platforms to users should be charged with VAT,"" a Meta spokesperson said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

The spokesperson added that the company takes its tax obligations seriously, pays all tax required in the countries where it operates and will fully cooperate with the authorities.

The EPPO, which is based in Luxembourg, said it did not comment on ongoing investigations nor would it publicly confirm which cases it was working on.

News of an administrative tax audit into Meta was first published on Wednesday by Italian daily Il Fatto Quotidiano.

The two sources said that investigators believe that free membership on Meta platforms comes in return for access to user data and should be classified as an exchange of services, therefore subject to VAT sales tax.

ROLE OF FREE ACCESS

Italy's tax police and revenue agency calculated a model under which Meta would have had to pay around 220 million euros of sales tax in Italy in 2021, according to the sources.

The figure for the period back to 2015 was calculated at 870 million euros.

One of the sources explained that the most relevant point was the establishment of a link between free access and data transfer as a taxable transaction, which could have repercussions for other multinationals and other countries in Europe.

A third source told Reuters that Meta believes there is no direct connection between the data provided by users and the access given to the platform, and without this link, there would be no VAT due.

The assessment by the Italian authorities has been brought to Meta's attention and a dialogue was under way between the company and the revenue agency, according to the sources.

The company may decide either to accept the results of the investigation and pay the requested amount, or contest it and open an administrative dispute.

In recent years, the Milan Prosecutor's Office has opened several tax investigations against multinational tech companies such as Google and Apple.

Usually, once an agreement for payment has been reached, the criminal investigation is closed. ($1 = 0.9401 euros)

92,META,2023-02-19,Meta to test monthly subscription service priced at $11.99,"













Feb 19 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms (META.O) on Sunday announced that it is testing a monthly subscription service, called Meta Verified, which will let users verify their accounts using a government ID and get a blue badge, as it looks to help content creators grow and build communities.

The subscription bundle for Instagram and Facebook, to be launched later this week, also includes extra protection against impersonation and will be priced starting at $11.99 per month on the web or $14.99 a month on Apple's iOS system and Android.

Meta Verified will be rolled out in Australia and New Zealand this week, with gradual launches in other countries to follow.

Meta's foray into subscription services follows Twitter, which announced last month that Twitter Blue will be priced at $11 per month.

The social media giant's CEO Mark Zuckerberg has earlier said it was planning to launch several new products that would ""empower creators to be way more productive and creative,"" while cautioning about the cost associated with supporting the technology for a large user base.

Other social media apps, like Snap Inc's (SNAP.N) Snapchat and messaging app Telegram launched paid subscription services last year, as a new source of revenue.

93,META,2023-02-14,Meta Oversight Board to begin reviewing cases more quickly,"













Feb 14 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms' (META.O) Oversight Board announced Tuesday it will review more types of content moderation cases and expedite some decisions, as it aims to expand its work.

The Oversight Board was created in late 2020 to review Facebook and Instagram's decisions on taking down or leaving up certain content and make rulings on whether to uphold or overturn the social media company's actions. Since then, the board has published 35 case decisions, it said in a blog post.

The board said it will now begin publishing decisions on some cases on an expedited basis. Rulings could come as quickly as 48 hours after accepting a case, while others could take up to 30 days.

Standard decisions, in which the Oversight Board reviews Meta's content moderation actions in depth, can take up to 90 days.

Publishing more decisions and increasing the pace will ""let us tackle more of the big challenges of content moderation, and respond more quickly in situations with urgent real-world consequences,"" the board said in the blog post.

Unlike standard decisions, expedited cases will be reviewed by a panel of board members instead of the full board and will not consider public comments.

One recent ruling by the Oversight Board was to allow Meta users to use the slogan ""death to Khamenei"" to criticize Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in the context of protests in Iran. read more

The board will also begin publishing summary decisions to analyze cases in which Meta changed its mind about whether to leave up or take down posts. Such cases could help Meta avoid similar mistakes in the future and may be useful for researchers and civil society, the board said.

It also said Tuesday it will add Kenji Yoshino, a constitutional law professor at New York University School of Law, as a new board member. With the addition of Yoshino, the Oversight Board now has 23 members.

94,META,2022-08-04,Facebook parent Meta set to raise $10 billion in bond debut,"













Aug 4 (Reuters) - Facebook-parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) is set to raise $10 billion in its first-ever bond offering on Thursday, as it looks to fund share buybacks and investments to revamp its business, according to two sources close to the deal.

The offering, which included bonds with maturities ranging from five years to 40 years, received over $30 billion of orders from investors, the sources said. They added the demand was skewed towards the longer-dated bonds.

Meta did not respond to a request for comment.

Among big technology companies, Meta had been the only one that did not have debt on its books. Tapping the market now would help it build a more traditional balance sheet. That could give it more financial room as it tries to fund some expensive initiatives, such as its metaverse virtual reality and Reels short video product, at a time its cash pile is depleting, the sources said.

The sources, who declined to be named as they were not authorized to speak publicly, said Meta started working in earnest on the offering over the last couple of months.

It decided to launch the offering after releasing earnings late July, they said. The varying maturities of its offering would give it more funding options in the future, they added.

A recent resurgence in corporate bond markets over the past month after a rout earlier this year amid uncertainty about interest rates gave Meta a window to tap the market now, the sources said.

Hoping the U.S. Federal Reserve's fight against inflation through aggressive rate increases was starting to have some impact, investors have rushed back into the bond market.

This week has been one of the busiest of the year, with U.S. investment grade companies raising nearly $60 billion in primary bond markets, according to Informa Global Markets data.

Other tech giants such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O) also issued bonds earlier this week, raising $5.5 billion and $6 billion, respectively.

Bankers and investors said such issuance windows may be fleeting and rare in the coming months. Credit spreads could widen later this year, increasing funding costs. read more

In late July, Meta posted a gloomy forecast and recorded its first-ever quarterly drop in revenue, with recession fears and competitive pressures weighing on its digital ads sales. read more

Its free-cash flow has been depleting as it charges ahead with its plans for the metaverse - a transformational bet that led the company to change its name to Meta last year.

In the second quarter ended June 30, Meta had $4.45 billion in free cash flow, compared with $8.51 billion a year ago.

The company received an 'A1' rating from Moody's and an 'AA- rating' and a 'stable' outlook from S&P.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch , Barclays , JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley were the joint bookrunners on the Meta bond offering.

95,META,2023-02-22,Meta preparing for fresh round of job cuts - Washington Post,"













Feb 22 (Reuters) - Facebook-parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) is planning a fresh round of job cuts in a reorganization and downsizing effort that could affect thousands of workers, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday.

Last year, the social media company let go 13% of its workforce - more than 11,000 employees - as it grappled with soaring costs and a weak advertising market.

Meta now plans to push some leaders into lower-level roles without direct reports, flattening the layers of management between top boss Mark Zuckerberg and the company's interns, the Washington Post reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.

Meta declined a Reuters request for comment, but spokesperson Andy Stone in a series of tweets cited several previous statements by Zuckerberg suggesting that more cuts were on the way.

Zuckerberg told investors earlier this month that last year's layoffs were ""the beginning of our focus on efficiency and not the end."" He said he would work on ""flattening our org structure and removing some layers of middle management.""

Last year's layoffs were the first in Meta's 18-year history. Other tech companies have cut thousands of jobs, including Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Snap Inc .

Meta aggressively hired during the COVID pandemic to meet a surge in social media usage by stuck-at-home consumers. But business suffered in 2022 as advertisers pulled the plug on spending in the face of rapidly rising interest rates.

Meta, once worth more than $1 trillion, is now valued at $446 billion. Meta shares were down about 0.5% on Wednesday.

The company has said it would also reduce office space, lower discretionary spending and extend a hiring freeze into 2023 to rein in expenses.

More than 100,000 layoffs were announced at U.S. companies in January, led by technology companies, according to a report from employment firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc.

96,META,2023-03-03,Meta tweaks its controversial 'cross-check' system for VIPs,"













March 3 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms (META.O) said on Friday it would implement most of the recommendations made by its independent oversight board to its policy of exempting high-profile users from some of its content-related rules.

The Facebook parent, however, rejected some suggestions to increase transparency and reduce bias toward content generated by public figures.

The oversight board had called for an overhaul of the company's controversial ""cross check"" system, which adds a layer of enforcement review for millions of Facebook and Instagram accounts belonging to celebrities, politicians and other influential users, allowing them extra leeway to post content that violates the company's policies.

Meta on Friday said it would fine-tune its criteria to assess who can be included to the list ""to better account for human rights interests and equity"" and decrease the time it takes to review cases.

The board has said the practice privileged the powerful and allowed business interests to influence content decisions.

One of the recommendations that Meta rejected suggested the social media company publicly mark the pages and accounts of certain public figures receiving list-based protection.

97,META,2022-06-09,Russia's Navalny scolds Google and Meta for helping Putin,"













LONDON, June 9 (Reuters) - Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny scolded Google (GOOGL.O) and Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) on Thursday for shutting down advertising, a step he said had undermined the opposition and thus was a gift to President Vladimir Putin.

Navalny, by far Russia's most prominent opposition leader, casts Putin's Russia as a dystopian state run by thieves and criminals where wrong is cast as right and judges are in fact representatives of a doomed lawless country.

In a written address to the Copenhagen Democracy Summit, Navalny, who is currently in a Russian jail, said technology was being used by the state to arrest dissidents but that it also gave an opportunity to get to the truth.

""The Internet gives us the ability to circumvent censorship,"" Navalny said in the address, a copy of which was posted on his official blog.

""Yet, at the same time, Google and Meta, by shutting down their advertising in Russia, have deprived the opposition of the opportunity to conduct anti-war campaigns, giving a grandiose gift to Putin.""

Neither Google nor Meta immediately responded to a request for comment on Navalny's remarks. Both companies paused advertising targetting users in Russia in March, just days after Russia invaded Ukraine.

Navalny earned admiration from the disparate Russian opposition for voluntarily returning to Russia in 2021 from Germany, where he had undergone treatment for what Western laboratory tests showed was an attempt to poison him with a nerve agent in Siberia.

The Kremlin has repeatedly dismissed Navalny's claims about Putin, who it says has won numerous elections in Russia since 2000 and remains by far the country's most popular politician. It has dismissed Navalny's assertion that Russia poisoned him.

Navalny, a former lawyer who rose to prominence more than a decade ago by lampooning Putin's elite and voicing allegations of corruption on a vast scale, said the titans of Silicon Valley had a lot of questions to answer.

They would have to decide, he said, whether or not they were really ""neutral platforms"" and whether or not users in democracies should operate under the same rules as those in repressive societies.

""How should the internet treat government directives, given that Norway and Uganda seem to have slightly different ideas about the role of the internet and democracy?"" he asked.

""We love technology. We love social networks. We want to live in a free informational society. So let's figure out how to keep the bad guys from using the information society to drive their nations and all of us into the dark ages.""

Summary Companies To back 11 shareholder proposals across the three AGMs

Says move an escalation measure after engaging with the firms

To focus on worker pay, health, representation at Amazon















LONDON, May 18 (Reuters) - Schroders (SDR.L), Britain's biggest listed asset manager, said on Wednesday it would back a swathe of shareholder resolutions at Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta (FB.O) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) concerning workers' and digital rights.

Schroders, which manages around 730 billion pounds ($905.64 billion), said it was declaring its intention to vote against management on the issues as an escalation measure following talks with the companies.

While any move to declare voting plans is still relatively rare among asset managers, more are starting to do so as part of efforts to accelerate change on environmental, social and governance-related issues such as climate change.

In total, Schroders said it would vote against 11 resolutions across the three companies at their annual general meetings.

The money manager said its engagement with Amazon had centred on supporting workers' rights, specifically improving staff pay and benefits, the health and wellbeing of workers and worker representation within the company.

At Meta and Alphabet, Schorders said it would vote in favour of improving their approach to digital rights, including the management of exploitative content, misinformation and privacy.

""These issues are growing in importance for our clients who are pressing us to do more to ensure the companies that we invest in are acting responsibly,"" said Kate Rogers, Head of Sustainability, Schroders Wealth Management.

""By voting against the management at Alphabet and Meta we are signalling the importance of big technology companies acting to avoid harm and tackling misinformation on their platforms. At Amazon, we stand with the workers, seeking more disclosure on working conditions and their treatment.""

Schroders added that it was still considering and would likely vote against other agenda items at the companies' AGMs.

99,META,2023-02-21,Meta appeals Kenyan court's decision it can be sued in Kenya,"













NAIROBI, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Facebook parent company Meta (META.O) has filed an appeal in Kenya challenging a ruling that said the company could be sued in the East African country even though it has no official presence there.

A Kenyan labour court earlier this month ruled that Meta could be sued in the country after a former content moderator filed a lawsuit alleging poor working conditions.

In the appeal, seen by Reuters on Tuesday, the U.S. company disputed the court's finding that Kenyan courts had jurisdiction over Meta.

Meta outsourced its content moderation work via Sama, a U.S.-headquartered company with operations in Kenya. Sama said last month it would no longer provide content moderation services for Meta.

The lawsuit was filed by former content moderator Daniel Motaung on behalf of a group of former Sama employees.

It seeks financial compensation, an order that outsourced moderators have the same healthcare and pay scale as Meta employees, that unionisation rights be protected and an independent human rights audit of the office.

Jan 26 (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc's (HD.N) Canadian arm was found to be sharing details from e-receipts related to in-store purchases with Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) without the knowledge or consent of its customers, according to Canada's privacy regulator.

An investigation by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) found that by participating in Meta's offline conversions program Home Depot shared the e-receipts that included encoded email addresses and purchase information.

The regulator added that the home goods chain stopped sharing customer information with Meta in October 2022, which was among the recommendations made by OPC, until the company is able to implement measures to ensure valid consent.

Home Depot and Meta did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

101,META,2022-07-01,D.C. judge scolds Meta lawyers for brief with 'excessive footnotes',"Summary

Summary Law firms A filing from Meta lawyers in antitrust litigation included 19 footnotes, the longest of which was over 150 words

The judge said Kellogg Hansen lawyers violated a local rule against ""excessive footnotes""















(Reuters) - A federal judge in Washington, D.C., ordered attorneys for Meta Platforms on Friday to refile a brief after he found they violated a court rule against ""excessive footnotes.""

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who has a track record of enforcing the rule, chided the lawyers from Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick.

They are representing Meta, formerly Facebook Inc., in an antitrust lawsuit filed against the tech company by the Federal Trade Commission.

They had filed a brief in Boasberg's court on Thursday that included 19 footnotes, the longest of which was over 150 words. The judge said the filing appeared to be an ""effort to circumvent page limits.""

The Kellogg Hansen lawyers quickly filed a new version of the brief on Friday that contained no footnotes. Mark Hansen, an attorney with the firm who signed the brief, did not immediately return a request for comment.

The D.C. federal court's rule, which was adopted in 2017, states that footnotes in pleadings ""shall not be excessive.""

The FTC is asking the court to demand that Meta sell Instagram and WhatsApp.

Meta's latest motion requests that the FTC share which activities available to Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp users fall within the commission's definition of ""personal social networking services.""

Boasberg has previously enforced the footnotes rule in his court. In 2020, he ordered the U.S. Department of Justice to refile a reply brief in a case over the State Department's record collection policies after the initial pleading included 12 footnotes with 80 lines of text.

Earlier that year, he threw out a brief by Standing Rock Sioux Tribe attorneys in litigation over the Dakota Access Pipeline for also violating the rule. Boasberg issued a similar order in response to a filing submitted by the Consumer Energy Alliance in the same case.

The case is Federal Trade Commission v. Meta Platforms, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, No. 20-cv-3590.

For the plaintiffs: Daniel Matheson of the Federal Trade Commission

For the defendants: Mark Hansen of Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick

102,META,2022-12-20,"Meta is building virtual world open to app makers, CEO tells antitrust court","[1/5] Meta Platforms Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg leaves federal court after attending the Facebook parent company's defense of its acquisition of virtual reality app developer Within Inc., in San Jose, California, U.S. December 20, 2022. REUTERS/Laure Andrillon















SAN JOSE, Calif., Dec 20 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) boss Mark Zuckerberg defended his acquisition of a virtual reality fitness app to an antitrust judge on Tuesday, arguing that his company was helping to build a nascent virtual reality industry, not dominate it.

Zuckerberg testified in federal court in San Jose, California, that owning app maker Within Unlimited was ""not that critical"" to Meta's ambitions, saying he primarily aimed to build communications tools and a platform for apps from different developers.

On fitness apps, he said, ""it's less important that we own the experiences than that they exist."" He said he was keen to see other firms build key productivity and gaming apps to draw a mass audience to virtual and augmented reality.

Zuckerberg was defending Meta's proposed acquisition in a high-profile trial over the future of the social media company's budding metaverse business. The Federal Trade Commission has accused Meta of trying to buy its way to the top of the VR industry.

FTC lawyers kicked off the proceedings by asking him about an internal email Zuckerberg wrote in 2015 where he said he expected Meta to build ""most of the apps and software services"" for the VR industry.

Zuckerberg replied that major platform owners tend to build the most popular apps in their area of expertise, likening Meta's emphasis on communications to Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) focus on productivity.

Platform companies have built ""the key apps, what they call the killer apps,"" Zuckerberg said, ""but they're not the only apps available.""

The FTC sued the Facebook and Instagram owner in July to stop the Within deal and asked the judge to order a preliminary injunction, saying Meta's ""campaign to conquer VR"" began in 2014 when it acquired Oculus, a VR headset manufacturer.

The trial is only one of many battles Meta is fighting against regulators globally over its alleged dominance in various markets. The European Commission on Monday said it had warned Meta of a possible antitrust breach related to online classified advertising.

The company said earlier on Tuesday that it does not expect to close the Within deal before Jan. 31 or until the day after the court rules on the FTC's request for a preliminary injunction.

MARKET DOMINANCE

FTC lawyers at the trial attempted to show that Meta had planned to compete with apps like Within, arguing that executives identified fitness as a way to expand VR use beyond its existing fan base of young male gamers.

They displayed a WhatsApp chat between two Meta executives in which one, Jason Rubin, said he had told Within executives that Meta was ""intent"" on getting into the fitness segment.

In the chat, Rubin said he relayed to Within that Meta could move faster if it had a first-party business - one that it owned - but also would ""support everyone like we do with games."" He said Zuckerberg was aware of the plan to deliver that message.

Zuckerberg said he could not recall a discussion with Rubin on the subject.

Meta has poured money into its metaverse-focused Reality Labs unit, recently drawing criticism from investors who have urged Zuckerberg to slow down as advertising sales crumble. Last month Meta said it would cut more than 11,000 jobs.

The social media company agreed to buy Within in October 2021, a day after changing its name from Facebook to Meta.

Zuckerberg told the court he decided to pursue the deal when Meta was in a stronger financial position and that he probably would not make the same decision in the current economic climate.

Within developed Supernatural, a VR app it advertises as a ""complete fitness service"" with choreographed workouts. It is available only on Meta's Quest headsets, which market research firm IDC estimates account for 90% of global shipments in the VR hardware market.

Meta also controls a Meta Quest Store with hundreds of apps, including top app Beat Saber, a dance game that executives considered expanding into the fitness space.

Zuckerberg testified that the Beat Saber proposal never proceeded beyond the brainstorming stage.

The FTC is separately trying to force Meta to unwind two previous acquisitions, Instagram and WhatsApp, in a lawsuit filed in 2020. Both were in relatively new markets at the time the companies were purchased.

103,META,2023-02-10,FTC withdraws from adjudication in fight with Meta over Within deal,"













WASHINGTON, Feb 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which lost a fight in court over whether Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) could buy VR content maker Within, has decided to withdraw the matter from its in-house adjudication, which was to begin on Monday.

An FTC administrative law judge had scheduled a hearing for the matter for next week, which will now be canceled. But no final decision had been made on whether the agency will go forward at a later date.

""The FTC is still deciding whether or not to continue an in-house trial before the administrative judge,"" an FTC spokesperson said.

FTC merger challenges can follow two tracks, pursuing the case in the federal court system or an in-house trial.

The agency lost in court. Judge Edward Davila of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California rejected the FTC's concerns that Meta's purchase of Within would reduce competition in a new market and declined to order a preliminary injunction. The FTC said Monday it would not appeal.

Meta, which closed the deal Wednesday, declined comment.

The FTC sued Meta in July to stop the Within deal, saying Meta's ""campaign to conquer VR"" began in 2014 when it acquired Oculus, a VR headset manufacturer.

Meta did not disclose what it was paying for Within, but the Information reported it was about $400 million.

A December trial to decide if Meta could go forward with the relatively small deal was seen as a test of the FTC's bid to head off what it sees as a repeat of the company acquiring small upcoming would-be rivals to dominate a market, this time in the nascent virtual and augmented reality markets.

The FTC has separately filed a lawsuit against Meta's Facebook, asking a court in 2020 to force it to sell subsidiaries Instagram and WhatsApp, saying the social media company used a ""buy or bury"" strategy to snap up rivals and keep smaller competitors at bay.

104,META,2022-10-20,Meta refuses to give up on campaign to disqualify FTC chair,"













(Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc has almost no chance of barring the chair of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, from participation in the FTC’s challenge to Meta's planned acquisition of virtual reality content developer Within Unlimited Inc.

But that has not stopped Meta from continuing to wage a campaign for Khan’s disqualification, as evidenced most recently in a filing this week with U.S. District Judge Edward Davila of San Jose, California, who is overseeing the FTC’s bid for a preliminary injunction to block Meta from acquiring Within.

The background: Meta and its predecessor Facebook have been arguing for more than a year that Khan’s pre-FTC speeches, writing and testimony showed so much animus toward Facebook and other big tech companies that she cannot be relied upon to make unbiased decisions as FTC chair.

It’s been a complex and multi-pronged effort. Meta first moved formally for Khan’s recusal last October, after she cast the deciding vote for the FTC to file an amended complaint in federal court accusing Facebook of antitrust violations related to its acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp. The FTC rebuffed the recusal demand, noting that its case against Facebook was being prosecuted in federal court, not in an administrative proceeding, so the company would receive full constitutional protection from the trial judge.

Meta then argued that Khan’s bias required dismissal of the FTC’s amended complaint because she cast the deciding vote for the commission to revive its lawsuit. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg of Washington, D.C., rejected that argument last January. The judge ruled that Khan was acting more like a prosecutor than a judge in voting for the FTC to file an amended complaint. Her previous expressions of her policy views about alleged big tech monopolists, Boasberg said, did not require Khan’s recusal under the standard for federal prosecutors.

But now Meta is contending that a different disqualification standard applies in the Within litigation, in which the FTC has brought both an administrative proceeding alleging that the proposed deal violates federal antitrust laws and a lawsuit in federal court to enjoin the transaction. In a recusal petition at the FTC last July, Meta lawyers from Weil, Gotshal & Manges said that Khan would be acting as a judge in any administrative case brought by the FTC, so the case would be marred by ""the prejudicial effect of her predetermined views of Meta.”

Meta subsequently sought to stay the administrative proceeding, arguing, among other things, that Khan’s participation “undermines the legitimacy"" of the case. (The petition and stay motion are not in the FTC docket but are exhibits in the preliminary injunction case.)

Meta also raised the issue of Khan’s purported bias as an affirmative defense in the preliminary injunction case before Davila in San Jose federal court, though not in a motion calling for her disqualification. Instead, its lawyers at Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick have asserted in an affirmative defense that Khan’s role in the FTC’s merger challenge has so tainted the litigation that the FTC cannot ultimately prevail and moreover that it would be unfair to grant a preliminary injunction to the FTC, given the agency’s “patently improper and inequitable conduct.”

Khan has declined to step aside from the merger challenge. We know this from an Oct. 6 letter from the FTC to Weil Gotshal in the administrative proceeding. The letter said that under the FTC’s recusal rules, Khan’s decision to remain in the case will now be reviewed by the other FTC commissioners.

Meta informed Davila of that procedural development in a filing this week in the preliminary injunction case, noting that it could be relevant to the FTC’s motion to strike Meta’s affirmative defenses.

Meta, as I mentioned, is almost certain to lose on the recusal issue before the full commission. FTC rules require that an individual commissioner’s decision not to recuse can only be overruled by a majority of the other commissioners. At the moment, there are only three FTC commissioners other than Khan, following the departure of Republican commissioner Noah Phillips. It’s unlikely that two of those three would vote to kick Khan off the Meta merger challenge.

In response to my query, Meta sent a statement about its recusal efforts: “We have previously expressed concern about Chair Khan’s impartiality in matters involving Meta, and we have the same concerns with regard to this case.” An FTC spokesman referred me to the agency’s recusal rules.

So why is Meta pushing so hard on an issue it has already lost once and is likely to lose again? To tease out that question, I talked to Louis Virelli, a professor at Stetson University College of Law. (Virelli correctly predicted last year that Meta’s disqualification play in the case before Boasberg would fail.)

The company, he said, has a stronger argument for Khan’s recusal in the Within merger litigation because the FTC chair is acting as an adjudicator in the administrative proceeding. But the FTC’s internal standard for recusal is ""very vague and open-ended,"" Virelli said, leaving plenty of room for the commissioner’s discretion. If Meta ends up losing the FTC’s administrative case, it will probably cite Khan’s refusal to recuse as one of its grounds for appeal, Virelli said, but the bar is very high in such appeals.

In the meantime, though, Virelli said, Meta can point to its protest of Khan’s ongoing participation in the administrative proceeding to argue against a preliminary injunction in federal court.

Remember, Meta is not asking Davila to order Khan off either the preliminary injunction case or the administrative proceeding. It is instead relying on its assertion that the administrative proceeding is tainted to refute the FTC’s arguments that it will ultimately prevail on the merits of the administrative proceeding and that the equities weigh in favor of blocking the deal while that case is litigated.

The company is paying a lot of lawyers across two parallel cases to play this multi-dimensional chess game. We’ll know more about whether the stratagem accomplished anything when the preliminary injunction case goes to a hearing in December.

NEW YORK, May 16 (Reuters) - Tiger Global Management, Winslow Capital Management, and Scopus Asset Management were among funds that sold all of their shares of streaming company Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) before the company reported its first loss of subscribers in over a decade in March, according to securities fillings released Monday.

The move away from Netflix, whose stock price is down 69% for the year to date, comes as fund managers reassess large technology companies which rallied following the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 and helped power the benchmark S&P 500 to record highs.

The S&P 500 is now down nearly 16% for the year to date, while the Russell 1000 Growth index (.RUI), which is more focused on technology companies, is down nearly 25% over the same period.

Hedge fund Light Street sold all its 149,025 shares in Facebook-parent Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) and 7,960 shares in Netflix. It almost halved its stake in Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and trimmed its exposure to Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), reducing it by 10% in the quarter that ended in March, filings show.

Hitchwood Capital Management LP, meanwhile, sold all of its 390,000 shares of Meta, while Dan Sundheim's D1 Capital also reduced its stake in Amazon by 22%, to 198,433 shares, and Melvin Capital sold all of its 850,000 shares of Meta.

Securities filings known as 13-Fs are one of the few public ways to see what hedge funds and other institutional investors hold in their portfolios, though they are backward-looking and do not reveal current positions.

Despite the broad move away from technology, some hedge funds added to their positions in select companies. Farallon Capital Management added 698,195 shares of Meta, whose shares are down 40.5% for the year so far.

Coatue Management, meanwhile, increased its number of shares in Meta Platforms Inc by 18.2% in the first quarter, to 2,797,896. It also bought more shares in Netflix, ending March with 1,438,956 shares, or 54.5% more than in December.

July 28 (Reuters) - Stiff competition from TikTok and Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) privacy changes will remain a cause for concern for Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) in the near term, Wall Street analysts said.

At least 16 brokerages cut their price targets on Meta after the company reported its first-ever quarterly revenue drop on Wednesday, highlighting challenges faced by U.S. companies from a stronger dollar and worries of an impending recession. read more

Shares of the company were down about 6% at $159.8, setting the Whatsapp owner on course to lose roughly $30 billion in market value for the day.

Last year, Meta's valuation hit the trillion-dollar mark and ended the year at more than $900 billion.

Apple upended the digital ad industry when it introduced new iPhone privacy controls last year that made it harder for companies such as Meta and Snap Inc (SNAP.N) to target and measure ads on their apps.

That, coupled with TikTok's aggressive growth, is worsening recessionary fears, according to analysts.

""Tough comps, macro and FX are certainly part of the near-term story, but TikTok competition and Apple iOS changes will both have a bigger impact than expected in 2022,"" J.P. Morgan analysts said.

Reels, a short video product that Meta is increasingly inserting into users' feeds to compete with TikTok, cannibalizes more profitable content and will be a headwind in the short term before eventually boosting income, company executives said. read more

Many analysts also expect Meta could return to stronger growth in 2023, but noted that the sputtering start to its metaverse dream, as regulators clamp down on big tech firms, would set back its innovation plans.

Also weighing on Meta's shares was the U.S. Federal Trade Commission seeking a court order to block the company from buying virtual reality content maker Within Unlimited. read more

108,META,2022-05-23,Facebook-owner Meta to share more political ad targeting data,"













May 23 (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) will share more data on targeting choices made by advertisers running political and social-issue ads in its public ad database, it said on Monday.

Meta said it would also include detailed targeting information for these individual ads in its ""Facebook Open Research and Transparency"" database used by academic researchers, in an expansion of a pilot launched last year.

""Instead of analyzing how an ad was delivered by Facebook, it's really going and looking at an advertiser strategy for what they were trying to do,"" said Jeff King, Meta's vice president of business integrity, in a phone interview.

The social media giant has faced pressure in recent years to provide transparency around targeted advertising on its platforms, particularly around elections. In 2018, it launched a public ad library, though some researchers criticized it for glitches and a lack of detailed targeting data.

Meta said the ad library will soon show a summary of targeting information for social issue, electoral or political ads run by a page.

""For example, the Ad Library could show that over the last 30 days, a Page ran 2,000 ads about social issues, elections or politics, and that 40% of their spend on these ads was targeted to 'people who live in Pennsylvania' or 'people who are interested in politics,'"" Meta said in a blog post.

Meta said the additional information in the ad library will be added in July. It said the data for vetted researchers will be available at the end of May and will show information since August 2020.

The company has run various programs with external researchers as part of its transparency efforts. Last year, it said a technical error meant flawed data had been provided to academics in its ""Social Science One"" project.

In 2021, the company said it had disabled the accounts of a group of New York University researchers studying political ads on its platform because of user privacy concerns. read more

109,META,2023-03-14,"Meta to cut 10,000 jobs in second round of layoffs","













March 14 (Reuters) - Facebook-parent Meta Platforms (META.O) said on Tuesday it would cut 10,000 jobs this year, making it the first Big Tech company to announce a second round of mass layoffs as the industry braces for a deep economic downturn.

Meta shares jumped 6% on the news. The widely-anticipated job cuts are part of a restructuring that will see the company scrap hiring plans for 5,000 openings, kill off lower-priority projects and ""flatten"" layers of middle management.

They followed the company's first mass layoff in the fall, which eliminated more than 11,000 jobs, or 13% of its workforce at the time, after a hiring spree that doubled the employee count it had as of 2020.

Worries of an economic downturn due to rising interest rates have sparked a series of mass job cuts across corporate America in recent months. Tech companies have led the way, shedding more than 290,000 workers since the start of 2022, according to tracking site Layoffs.fyi.

Meta's purge of employees has been one of the sector's most pronounced. On top of inflation woes, the company is also facing down unique threats to its core digital ads business while spending handsomely on Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's plans to build a futuristic metaverse.

In a message to staff on Tuesday, Zuckerberg said most of the new cuts would be announced in the next two months, though in some cases they would continue through the end of the year.

""For most of our history, we saw rapid revenue growth year after year and had the resources to invest in many new products. But last year was a humbling wake-up call,"" Zuckerberg wrote.

""I think we should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new economic reality will continue for many years.""

Zuckerberg said he planned to further reduce the size of the recruiting team, which was already hard-hit in the fall layoffs. Restructurings in the tech group would be announced in late April and cuts to business groups would come in May.

Meta also will remove multiple layers of management and ask many managers to become individual contributors, while eliminating non-engineering roles, automating more functions and at least partially reversing a commitment to ""remote-first"" work that Zuckerberg made amid COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.

SATISFYING INVESTORS

The first of the latest wave of cuts appeared to have started even before Zuckerberg's announcement. On Friday, Meta said it was exploring ""strategic alternatives"" for Kustomer, a customer service company it acquired last year.

It also disbanded its skunkworks New Product Experimentation team and reassigned leader Ime Archibong to work on product for Messenger, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. Both changes were initially reported by the Wall Street Journal.

Investors have grown wary of Zuckerberg's prolific spending as revenue growth from Meta's main businesses petered out amid high inflation and a digital ads pullback from the pandemic e-commerce boom.

The company also has struggled with Apple-led (AAPL.O) privacy changes and competition for young users from short video app TikTok.

At the same time, Meta has been pouring billions of dollars into its metaverse-oriented Reality Labs unit, which lost $13.7 billion in 2022, and investing in infrastructure to support its artificial intelligence usage.

Wall Street has been rewarding Meta steadily since its November restructuring, after its share price fell more than 70% earlier in 2022. The stock received another boost in February when Zuckerberg dubbed 2023 the ""Year of Efficiency,"" with new cost controls and a $40-billion share buyback.

The latest downsizing indicates ""how desperate the company is to get costs under control as its revenues have fallen amid declining marketing budgets,"" said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter.

""Virtual reality is an expensive business to be in, so while (Meta) maps out a path through an uncertain landscape, it needs to find efficiencies elsewhere,"" she added.

In his memo, Zuckerberg made scant mention of virtual reality and instead emphasized the company's focus on AI, saying Meta's single largest investment was in ""advancing AI and building it into every one of our products.""

Meta has teased AI-powered ""creative aids"" that can generate images, videos and text but has yet to offer any such products on its apps, even as peers have launched dueling generative AI chatbots and productivity tools in recent months.

With the latest cuts, Meta expects expenses in 2023 to come in between $86 billion and $92 billion, lower than the $89 billion to $95 billion forecast previously.

Nov 11 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms (META.O) is exiting its Portal smart display business and will wind down work on smartwatch projects, executives said on Friday during an employee townhall meeting.

Meta on Wednesday announced about 11,000 job cuts, or 13% of its workforce, the first mass layoffs in the company's 18-year history. Following the layoffs, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg had addressed employees but not taken any questions.

The Facebook parent has aimed to shed costs as it refocuses on metaverse technologies and concedes to a global slowdown in advertising sales.

111,META,2022-11-09,"Meta cuts 11,000 jobs as it sinks more money into the metaverse","













Nov 9 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) said on Wednesday it would cut more than 11,000 jobs, or 13% of its workforce, as the Facebook parent doubled down on its risky metaverse bet amid a crumbling advertising market and decades-high inflation.

The mass layoffs, among the biggest this year and the first in Meta's 18-year history, follow thousands of job cuts at other tech companies including Elon Musk-owned Twitter Inc, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Snap Inc .

Like its peers, Meta aggressively hired during the pandemic to meet a surge in social media usage by stuck-at-home consumers. But business has suffered this year as advertisers and consumers pull the plug on spending in the face of soaring costs and rapidly rising interest rates.

""Not only has online commerce returned to prior trends, but the macroeconomic downturn, increased competition, and ads signal loss have caused our revenue to be much lower than I'd expected,"" Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said in a message to employees.

""I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that.""

On a short call on Wednesday that Reuters had access to, a red-eyed Zuckerberg addressed employees but took no questions. He stuck to a script that closely followed the wording in the morning's blogpost and called the increased investments in e-commerce a ""big mistake in planning.""

He said he would host another townhall on Friday in which he would take questions.

Meta, once worth more than $1 trillion, is now valued at $256 billion after losing more than 70% of its value this year alone.

Meta shares rose 4% on Wednesday as investors cheered caution by a company that has been pinning its future on the metaverse with pricey investments that Zuckerberg himself says will take a decade to bear fruit.

""The market is breathing a sigh of relief that Meta's management or Zuckerberg specifically seems to be heeding some advice, which is you need to take some of the steam out of the growing expenditure bill,"" Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Sophie Lund-Yates said.

The company now expects 2023 expenses of $94 billion to $100 billion, compared with the $96 billion to $101 billion projected previously. It also narrowed its 2023 capital expenditures forecast range.

Other than the job cuts, which will impact units across Meta with a disproportional hit to the recruiting and business teams, the company will also reduce office space, lower discretionary spending and extend a hiring freeze into the first quarter to rein in expenses.

METAVERSE CASH BURN

Still, more of the leftover resources will go toward the Reality Labs unit responsible for its metaverse investments. The business lost $9.44 billion from January to September this year, with losses expected to grow significantly in 2023.

The spending spree has drawn the ire of Wall Street and shareholders, with one investor recently calling the investments ""super-sized and terrifying."" Analysts have also questioned how long Meta can pour money into the project in a weak economy.

""They're going to have to continue to rightsize. ... Next year is going to be a difficult environment for them,"" said Paul McCarthy at Kisco Capital, which previously owned Meta shares.

McCarthy added he was skeptical about the company's metaverse bets, and that rising interest rates and a gloomy macro environment could continue to weigh on the ad market.

As part of the severance package, Meta will pay 16 weeks of base pay and two additional weeks for every year of service, as well as all remaining paid time off.

Affected employees will also receive shares that were set to vest on Nov. 15 and healthcare coverage for six months, according to Meta, which had 87,314 employees as of the end of September.

The company did not disclose the exact charge for the layoffs, but said the figure was included in its previously announced 2022 expense outlook of between $85 billion and $87 billion.

112,META,2022-11-30,Meta executive says holiday sales were earlier and bigger this year,"













Nov 30 (Reuters) - The head of Meta Platforms' (META.O) business group said on Wednesday that the holiday shopping season started earlier than usual this year and produced a Black Friday sales weekend that appeared to be the biggest on record.

Consumers anxious about supply shortages were stocking up early on desired gifts, while businesses with excess inventory sought to clear it out with heavy discounts, said Meta Vice President of Global Business Nicola Mendelsohn, speaking in an interview at the Reuters NEXT conference.

""We're seeing that there are more and more deals, and so we're helping obviously to connect advertisers to be able to reach the people that matter to them,"" she said.

The holiday ad sales could be a welcome respite for Meta, which has been struggling this year as advertisers and consumers pulled the plug on spending amid soaring costs and rapidly rising interest rates.

The company forecast a grim outlook for the fourth quarter and laid off 13% of its workforce earlier this month, heavily affecting Mendelsohn's team. More than half of those laid off were in business positions, executives told employees.

Mendelsohn said she checks in with her team regularly to ask how people are feeling, encouraging employees in stressful times to focus on ""what you can control.""

""Don't see the whole thing as a big amorphous mess, kind of break it down,"" she said she tells them.

Feb 3 (Reuters) - Big Tech companies have a new obsession: artificial intelligence.

This week, chief executives across the sector packed earnings calls with mentions of the heavily hyped technology, which until recently existed more in the background than as a solid contributor to the bottom line.

In conference calls after financial results, tech execs uttered the phrases ""AI,"" ""generative AI,"" or ""machine learning"" from two to six times as often as they did in the previous quarter, according to a review of conference transcripts by Reuters.

Executives from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), behind the latest big rivalry in tech, took their battle to the conference-call front lines. On Thursday, Alphabet appeared to edge out the competition. The Google-owner's call referred to AI 45 times, up from 13 times at the end of the third quarter, outpacing Microsoft, whose call was peppered with 39 references, up from 15 in the previous quarter.

The release of software that can generate virtually text and images, exemplified by ChatGPT, a chatbot from the startup OpenAI, has set off a race to integrate AI into more products and for investors to bet on which company will emerge on top.

Microsoft's investment in OpenAI and aggressive efforts to make ChatGPT widely available to its cloud customers, among other plans, represent a new challenge to Alphabet. Industry observers have said embedding human-like, ChatGPT-style responses in Microsoft's Bing search engine could give it a leg up on Alphabet's Google, long the information search leader.

In a potential nod to the public's ChatGPT fixation, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said Google remained in the game.

""We'll pursue this work boldly, but with a deep sense of responsibility,"" he said.

AI software will be an important focus for Alphabet, which is planning to make its own LaMDA chatbot software publicly available in the coming weeks, he added.

David Heger, an analyst with Edward Jones, said Google was opening up more about its large AI investments after staying quiet.

""They were much more vocal about how that benefits pretty much all parts of their business and how they expect that to be further integrated into their business going forward,"" he said.

SHAPING SOCIAL MEDIA

Snap Inc (SNAP.N) CEO Evan Spiegel said on the social media company's fourth-quarter call that generative AI would be critical over the next five years to growing augmented reality (AR), which is important to its business.

That technology, which overlays computerized images onto the real world, is currently limited because artists must build 3D models, but generative AI can speed up the process, Spiegel said.

""Imagine playing around with your kids wearing AR glasses and saying, 'oh my gosh, there's a pirate ship and a big monster.' We can bring those to life using generative (AI) art, which I think is really exciting,"" he said.

Mark Zuckerberg likewise called generative AI ""an extremely exciting new area"" on Wednesday during a conference call that referenced the phrase 30 times, up from 22 times in the previous quarter. The Facebook founder and CEO of Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), whose shares rocketed 20% after reporting financial results, said users could expect the company to ""launch a number of different things this year"" in generative AI.

Meta plans to incorporate the new technology across almost all its products, such as generating images, videos, avatars and 3D assets, Zuckerberg said. The software will help content creators produce more across Meta's apps, he added. And marketers could use generative AI to help with written copy for their paid posts or create imagery and video, Nicola Mendelsohn, vice president of the global business group for Meta, said in an interview.

""One of my goals for Meta is to build on our research to become a leader in generative AI,"" said Zuckerberg.

Even at Apple Inc (AAPL.O), where hardware such as the iPhone has reigned supreme, AI is a big part of the future.

Asked by an analyst about Apple's AI strategy, Chief Executive Tim Cook said Thursday the company is using such tech to power features like car crash detection in its iPhone and Apple Watch, and that it will be applied throughout Apple's products and services.

""We see an enormous potential in this space to affect virtually everything we do,"" Cook said. ""It's obviously a horizontal technology, not a vertical. And so it will affect every product and every service that we have.""

Sept 6 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) will host its annual event on Oct. 11 to showcase augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) offerings, and possibly release its much touted VR headset code-named Project Cambria.

Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post on Tuesday announced the event date with a picture of him wearing a VR headset, hinting at the long-awaited headset release.

Meta did not respond to a Reuters query seeking confirmation on the release of the new product.

Zuckerberg, on a podcast last month, said the new headset will have advanced sensors to track eyes and facial cues, with capabilities to mirror those expressions onto digital avatar in real time.

Project Cambria, which will be the successor to Meta Quest 2, will be the centerpiece of the company's metaverse strategy.

Over the last few months, Meta has announced updates to its VR social platform, Horizon Worlds, including creator payments, opened a physical store to demo the gadgets and also bumped prices of existing VR headset models.

The event date announcement follows the departure of Vice President Vivek Sharma, who spearheaded the development of the Horizon Worlds platform and related offerings. read more

116,META,2022-04-11,Meta to start testing money-making tools for its metaverse,"













April 11 (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta Platforms (FB.O) is beginning to test tools for selling digital assets and experiences within its virtual reality platform Horizon Worlds, a key part of its plan for creating a metaverse, it said on Monday.

The tools will be available initially to ahandpicked set of users who are creating virtual classes, games and fashion accessorieswithin the company's immersive platform, which is accessible via VR headsets, Meta said in a statement.

Using one tool, those select users will be able to sell their accessories or offer paid access to specialized digital spacesthey have built, the company said.

The social media giant is also testing out a ""creator bonus"" program for a small set of Horizon Worlds users in the United States, through which it will pay participants eachmonth for using new features the company launches.

""We want there to just be tons of awesome worlds, and in order for that to happen there needs to be a lot of creators who can support themselves and make this their job,"" Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a conversation with early adopters, held inside Horizon Worlds using avatars.

The Facebook parent company, which changed its name to Meta last year, has invested heavily in virtual and augmented reality to reflect its new bet on the metaverse, a futuristic idea of a network of virtual environments accessed via different devices where users can work, socialize and play.

The company is competing with up-and-coming virtual world players where land, buildings, avatars and even names can be bought and sold as non-fungible tokens, or blockchain-based virtual assets. The market for these assets exploded last year, with sales sometimes fetching hundreds of thousands of dollars. read more

117,META,2022-12-14,Meta accused in lawsuit of allowing posts that inflamed Ethiopia conflict,"













Dec 14 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms (META.O) was accused in a lawsuit filed in Kenya on Wednesday of letting violent and hateful posts from Ethiopia flourish on Facebook, inflaming the Ethiopian civil war.

The lawsuit, filed by two Ethiopian researchers and the Kenya's Katiba Institute rights group, alleges that Facebook's recommendations systems amplified violent posts in Ethiopia, including several that preceded the murder of the father of one of the researchers.

""Not only does Facebook allow such content to be on the platform, they prioritise it and they make money from such content. Why are they allowed to do that?"" Mercy Mutemi, the lawyer representing the two Ethiopian researchers, told a news conference in Nairobi.

The lawsuit also said Meta failed to exercise reasonable care in training its algorithms to identify dangerous posts and in hiring staff to police content for the languages covered by its regional moderation hub in Nairobi.

Meta spokesperson Erin McPike said hate speech and incitement to violence were against the rules of Facebook and Instagram.

""We invest heavily in teams and technology to help us find and remove this content,"" McPike said. ""We employ staff with local knowledge and expertise and continue to develop our capabilities to catch violating content in the most widely spoken languages in"" Ethiopia.

REUTERS/Monicah Mwangi 1 2 3 4 5

Meta's independent Oversight Board last year recommended a review of how Facebook and Instagram have been used to spread content that heightens the risk of violence in Ethiopia.

The plaintiffs are asking the court to order Meta to take emergency steps to demote violent content, increase moderation staff in Nairobi and create restitution funds of about $2 billion for global victims of violence incited on Facebook.

The father of Abrham Meareg, one of the Ethiopian researchers, faced ethnic slurs and calls for his death in Facebook posts in October 2021 that revealed where he lived, according to the lawsuit.

It alleges that Abrham reported them Facebook immediately but the company failed to remove them promptly or in some cases at all.

Abrham's father, an ethnic Tigrayan, was murdered on Nov. 3 2021, according to the lawsuit. Abrham told Reuters he held Meta ""directly responsible"" for his father's death.

The case echoes accusations Meta has faced over content on its platforms related to violence elsewhere, including in Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Cambodia. The company has acknowledged being ""too slow"" to act in Myanmar.

Thousands have died and millions have been displaced in the Ethiopian conflict that erupted in 2020 between the federal government and rebellious forces from the northern Tigray region. The two sides agreed in November to a permanent cessation of hostilities.

118,META,2023-02-21,Meta appeals Kenyan court's decision it can be sued in Kenya,"













NAIROBI, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Facebook parent company Meta (META.O) has filed an appeal in Kenya challenging a ruling that said the company could be sued in the East African country even though it has no official presence there.

A Kenyan labour court earlier this month ruled that Meta could be sued in the country after a former content moderator filed a lawsuit alleging poor working conditions.

In the appeal, seen by Reuters on Tuesday, the U.S. company disputed the court's finding that Kenyan courts had jurisdiction over Meta.

Meta outsourced its content moderation work via Sama, a U.S.-headquartered company with operations in Kenya. Sama said last month it would no longer provide content moderation services for Meta.

The lawsuit was filed by former content moderator Daniel Motaung on behalf of a group of former Sama employees.

It seeks financial compensation, an order that outsourced moderators have the same healthcare and pay scale as Meta employees, that unionisation rights be protected and an independent human rights audit of the office.

119,META,2022-09-30,Meta board approves personal security to outgoing executive Sheryl Sandberg,"













Sept 30 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) said on Friday its board had approved providing personal security services to former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, citing ""continuing threats to her safety"".

The company, however, did not elaborate on the threats that Sandberg, one of the most powerful women in Silicon Valley, faces. It expects to continue to pay for security services at her residences and during her personal travel from Oct. 1 till June 30 next year.

Sandberg, a close associate of Meta's Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, said in June she would depart the social media giant after a 14-year stint when she led the company's often-criticized ads-based business model.

Under Sandberg, the company was also buffeted by revelations in 2018 that U.K. consultancy Cambridge Analytica had improperly acquired data on millions of its U.S. users to target election advertising.

The same year, U.N. human rights investigators said the use of Facebook had played a key role in spreading hate speech that fueled violence against the Rohingya community in Myanmar.

Sandberg will no longer be an employee after Sept. 30 but will remain on its board, the Facebook-owner said in a regulatory filing.

Previously, Meta has spent heavily on the security of its top executives. Last year, the company spent $26.8 million for the personal security and private aircraft of Zuckerberg, it revealed in April.

Jan 26 (Reuters) - Shares of BuzzFeed Inc (BZFD.O) jumped on Thursday on reports of a deal with Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and plans to use artificial intelligence to personalize and enhance the digital media firm's online quizzes and content.

The stock was 19% higher in extended trading, after more than doubling in value earlier in the day as a Wall Street Journal report said it would use ChatGPT creator OpenAI for its content.

Buzzfeed, in an emailed response to Reuters, said ""we are not using ChatGPT - we are using OpenAI's publicly available API (application programming interface).""

Earlier in the day, the stock had jumped 50% on a separate report by the Journal that said Meta was paying BuzzFeed millions of dollars to bring more creators to Facebook and Instagram.

The deal, reached last year, was valued at close to $10 million and BuzzFeed will help generate content for Meta's platforms and train creators to grow their presence online, the report had said, citing people familiar with the situation.

The stock closed at $2.09 after touching a high of $2.45.

Indicating interest from retail traders, BuzzFeed shares were among the top three orders on Fidelity's platform on Thursday.

Shares of the company, valued at $132 million, have tanked more than 90% to Wednesday's close since going public in December 2021 through a reverse merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC).

The company said last month it would cut about 12% of its workforce to rein in costs. Its third-quarter net loss had widened to $27 million from $3.6 million a year ago.

Companies Meta Platforms Inc Follow















Aug 23 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) reached a $37.5 million settlement of a lawsuit accusing the parent of Facebook of violating users' privacy by tracking their movements through their smartphones without permission.

A preliminary settlement of the proposed class action was filed on Monday in San Francisco federal court, and requires a judge's approval.

It resolved claims that Facebook violated California law and its own privacy policy by gathering data from users who turned off Location Services on their mobile devices.

The users said that while they did not want to share their locations with Facebook, the company nevertheless inferred where they were from their IP (internet protocol) addresses, and used that information to send them targeted advertising.

Monday's settlement covers people in the United States who used Facebook after Jan. 30, 2015.

Meta denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. It did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment.

In June 2018, Facebook and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told the U.S. Congress that the Menlo Park, California-based company uses location data ""to help advertisers reach people in particular areas.""

As an example, it said users who dined at particular restaurants might receive posts from friends who also ate there, or ads from businesses that wanted to provide services nearby.

The lawsuit began in November 2018. Lawyers for the plaintiffs may seek up to 30% of Monday's settlement for legal fees, settlement papers show.

Jury found Meta violated video-streaming, messaging patents















(Reuters) - Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc said it will appeal a nearly $175 million verdict awarded Wednesday by jurors in Austin, Texas, who found it infringed two patents belonging to walkie-talkie app maker Voxer Inc related to video streaming and messaging.

Meta's Facebook Live and Instagram Live live-streaming features used Voxer's patented technology, the jury said after a seven-day trial, granting Voxer $174.5 million in patent royalty damages.

A Meta spokesperson said Thursday that the company believes the evidence showed it did not infringe. Meta intends to contest the verdict in the trial court and through an appeal, the spokesperson said.

Voxer and its attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday.

San Francisco-based Voxer launched its app in 2011. It said it had a series of meetings with Facebook in 2012 about a potential collaboration where it disclosed its patented technology to the tech giant.

The meetings did not lead to an agreement, and Facebook cut Voxer off from key features of its platform in 2013, according to Voxer's 2020 lawsuit. Voxer said the company now known as Meta launched Facebook Live in 2015 and Instagram Live the next year, allegedly integrating the streaming technology it pioneered.

One of the Voxer patents covers a method for streaming video, and the other covers infrastructure for a video-messaging service. The jury rejected Meta's argument that the video-messaging patent was invalid on Wednesday.

Meta told the court in a filing Tuesday that no reasonable juror could find its services worked in the same way as Voxer's patented technology, and that the app maker was not entitled to any damages.

The case is Voxer Inc v. Meta Platforms Inc, U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, No. 1:20-cv-00655.

Law firms Related documents Judge leaves door open to questioning on some topics

FTC argued demand amounted to ""examination"" of its lawyers















(Reuters) - A California federal judge on Tuesday spurned a bid by Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc to depose U.S. Federal Trade Commission officials over the agency's lawsuit seeking to block the social media company from buying virtual reality content maker Within Unlimited Inc.

In a court ruling, U.S. Magistrate Judge Susan van Keulen said the FTC already had provided enough information to Meta as it builds its defense against the federal agency’s antitrust lawsuit.

The FTC sued Meta in July, claiming its acquisition of Within would reduce competition in the market for virtual reality fitness apps. Meta has denied the claims and called the case ""ill-conceived.""

Meta's lawyers had asked van Keulen to let them question the FTC on a range of topics about the case, including how the agency derived the relevant market. They said the agency had ""taken the extreme position of refusing to produce any representative"" for a deposition.

The judge found much of what Meta wanted to ask the agency about in depositions was shielded by a protection for attorney ""work product.""

A Meta spokesperson on Wednesday did not immediately comment, and a representative from the FTC declined to comment.

Lawyers for Meta at Weil, Gotshal & Manges and Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

Van Keulen's order left open the possibility that FTC officials would be required to sit for questioning later on in the litigation, after a ruling on Meta's request that the lawsuit be dismissed. She said the FTC ""is not entitled to a blanket protective order"" that would shield the agency from depositions focused on allegations in a lawsuit.

Van Keulen deferred ruling on whether to allow Meta to depose the FTC about any communication with state attorneys general and about whether FTC Chair Lina Khan should be recused from participating in the merger challenge.

Meta's lawyers long have argued Khan should be recused from matters involving the company based on statements she made critical of ""big tech"" market powers before her Biden administration appointment to lead the FTC.

FTC lawyers said in a recent court filing that Meta's deposition demand of the agency was the ""practical equivalent of an examination of opposing counsel.""

Meta's effort seeking dismissal of the FTC's lawsuit is pending before U.S. District Judge Edward Davila in San Jose federal court.

The case is Federal Trade Commission v. Meta Platforms Inc, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 5:22-cv-04325.

126,META,2023-02-02,U.S. FTC denies Meta petition to recuse Khan from Within Unlimited review,"













WASHINGTON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) rejected a petition filed by Facebook-parent Meta seeking the recusal of Chair Lina Khan from participating in any decision concerning the review of Meta’s proposed merger with virtual reality app maker Within Unlimited.

The FTC, which sued in July to block the deal, said without Khan's participation that it had denied the order.

U.S. Judge Edward Davila on Tuesday ruled that Meta could proceed with its acquisition, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters, confirming reports by Bloomberg News and others.

Davila granted the FTC’s request to temporarily block the closing until Feb. 7 in order to give the commission time to assess options, the source confirmed. Davila's sealed opinion has not been released publicly.

The FTC in seeking to block the deal called Facebook a ""global technology behemoth,"" noting its ownership of popular apps such as Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, and said its ""campaign to conquer VR"" began in 2014 when it acquired Oculus, a VR headset manufacturer. Facebook agreed to buy Within in October 2021.

Meta sought Khan's recusal over prior statements about Facebook made before she joined the FTC.

Two of the FTC commissioners said in rejecting Khan's recusal: ""Those statements concern a different industry, a different realm of transactions than those presented here, and, effectively, a different acquiring company.""

Meta previously filed a petition to disqualify Khan from an FTC antitrust lawsuit alleging that Meta monopolized the market for personal social networking services. A U.S. judge last year ruled that Khan’s disqualification was not required.

FTC Commissioner Christine Wilson dissented from the recusal decision, pointing to Khan's prior 2017 statement urging the FTC ""to ban all future Meta transactions."" Wilson said that was ""an express statement that Meta transactions are illegal.""

127,META,2023-02-06,U.S. FTC will not appeal decision allowing Meta to purchase VR content maker Within,"













WASHINGTON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said it will not appeal its loss in federal court in its fight to stop Meta Platforms (META.O) from buying VR content maker Within Unlimited, but could still pursue the case with an internal FTC administrative law judge.

Judge Edward Davila of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California last week declined to stop Meta from acquiring the VR content maker, rejecting the regulator's concerns the deal would reduce competition in a new market.

An FTC official said that no decision had yet been made as to whether the agency would try to stop the deal in a process before an FTC administrative law judge. The hearing for that is set for Feb. 13.

Meta declined to comment on the decision not to appeal last week's ruling in federal court.

The FTC sued Meta in July to stop the Within deal, asking the judge to order a preliminary injunction, saying Meta's ""campaign to conquer VR"" began in 2014 when it acquired Oculus, a VR headset manufacturer.

Meta did not disclose what it was paying for Within but tech publication the Information put the price at about $400 million.

A December trial to decide if Meta could go forward with the relatively small deal was seen as a test of the FTC's bid to head off what it sees as a repeat of the company acquiring small upcoming would-be rivals to dominate a market, this time in the nascent virtual and augmented reality markets.

The FTC has separately filed an ongoing lawsuit against Meta's Facebook, asking a court in 2020 to force it to sell subsidiaries Instagram and WhatsApp, saying the social media company used a ""buy or bury"" strategy to snap up rivals and keep smaller competitors at bay. read more

128,META,2022-03-24,Meta inks partnership for 3D ads in step toward the metaverse,"













March 24 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) will make it easier for brands to run three-dimensional ads on its Facebook and Instagram social media platforms through a new partnership with an ecommerce technology firm.

The integration with VNTANA will allow brands to upload the 3D models of their products to Facebook and Instagram and easily convert them into ads, VNTANA said on Thursday in a press release.

The move is a stepping stone into advertising in the metaverse, said VNTANA Chief Executive Ashley Crowder, referring to the futuristic idea of a collection of virtual worlds that can be accessed through devices such as headsets.

Meta has staked its future on contributing to the building of the metaverse, which it has said could take up to a decade to be realized.

Meta previously partnered with augmented reality (AR) companies Modiface and PerfectCorp to help beauty and cosmetic brands more easily run 3D and AR advertising.

""The metaverse is basically the spatial internet,"" Crowder said. ""It is a whole world of possibility that starts with having the right 3D models of your products.""

Facebook and Instagram users who see a 3D ad while browsing on their desktop or phone can interact with an image of a handbag, for instance, and move it around to view the item from all angles.

""In a way, this offers a glimpse of what you might expect on future devices like AR glasses,"" said Chris Barbour, director of augmented reality partnerships at Meta's Reality Labs unit.

Before VNTANA's integration with Meta, advertisers would need to reformat 3D files to be compatible with Meta's ad systems. Now, brands can use VNTANA to easily upload and convert the files into ads without technical expertise in working with 3D images, Crowder said.

129,META,2022-06-01,"EU acted like a fishing trawler in antitrust data searches, Meta lawyer says","













LUXEMBOURG, June 1 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) on Wednesday compared searches by EU antitrust regulators to a fishing super trawler as watchdogs investigate the owner of Facebook's data and online marketplace.

Meta says it has already handed over more than a million documents to the European Commission since its first request in 2019 regarding its Facebook Marketplace, social networking and online classified ads.

The company has, however, questioned the necessity and proportionality of the data requests and the reasons provided by the watchdog. It has also criticised the agency's use of 2,500 search phrases - including ""big question"", ""for free"" and ""not good for us"" - to trawl the company's documents.

Meta, which faces an 8 million euro ($8.6 million) daily penalty payment if it does not comply with the demands, subsequently took its grievance to the General Court, the EU's second highest.

""One needs to put together the vague nature of what is under investigation with these extraordinarily wide ranging and general search terms,"" Meta lawyer Daniel Jowell told the panel of five judges. ""Once one does that, it is, with respect, obvious what is going on here. This is a classic fishing expedition.

""Indeed, we would go further. The Commission is operating like a fishing super trawler, hoovering up the whole sea bed - with the intention that it will later see what species of rare fish it finds within its vast nets,"" Jowell said.

The Commission dismissed the criticism.

""The allegation of a fishing expedition is manifestly unfounded,"" the watchdog's lawyer Giuseppe Conte told the court, adding that the Commission was investigating seven anti-competitive practices and had requested documents in order to determine if there were any infringements.

""The subject matter was defined in sufficiently clear terms,"" Conte said.

He said based on case law the EU competition agency is not required to explain the search terms it uses and that it only widened the number of search terms after Meta offered only a handful of documents in the preliminary stage.

The court will rule in coming months.

The cases are T-451/20 and T-452/20 Meta Platforms Ireland v Commission.

Summary Companies Moscow court says Meta engaged in 'extremist activity'

Facebook, Instagram already banned in Russia

Prosecutors, court say WhatsApp will not be affected

Lawmaker says Meta can return if it sticks to Russia's terms















March 21 (Reuters) - A Moscow court said on Monday that Meta (FB.O) was guilty of ""extremist activity"", but the ruling will not affect its WhatsApp messenger service, focusing on the U.S. firm's already-banned Facebook and Instagram social networks.

Meta did not respond to requests for comment after Moscow's Tverskoi District Court said in a press statement that it had upheld a lawsuit filed by state prosecutors on banning the company's activities on Russian territory.

Meta's lawyer Victoria Shakina had earlier told the court that the company was not carrying out extremist activities and was against Russophobia, the Interfax news agency reported.

It was not clear whether Meta would appeal the outlawing of the activities of Facebook and Instagram in Russia ""on the grounds of realising extremist activity"", a ban TASS cited judge Olga Solopova as saying would be enforced immediately.

Late on Monday, communications regulator Roskomnadzor said it will exclude Meta from the list of foreign entities operating on the Internet in Russia, and Instagram and Facebook from the register of social networks, according to news agencies.

Roskomnadzor also said that Russian media must label Meta and its social networks as prohibited when distributing information and are forbidden to display their logos.

Russia has in the past designated groups such as the Taliban and Islamic State as ""extremist"" but later expanded this to the Jehovah's Witnesses and jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation.

Facebook last year had 7.5 million users in Russia and WhatsApp had 67 million, researcher Insider Intelligence estimates, while Instagram has said its ban will affect 80 million users in Russia.

UKRAINE TENSIONS

The implications of the ruling remain unclear as Facebook and Instagram are already banned in Russia and the court said WhatsApp would be unaffected by its ruling.

""The decision does not apply to the activities of Meta's messenger WhatsApp, due to its lack of functionality for the public dissemination of information,"" the court said.

Russia initially banned Facebook for restricting access to Russian media while Instagram was blocked earlier this month after Meta said it would allow social media users in Ukraine to post messages urging violence against Russian President Vladimir Putin and troops Moscow sent into Ukraine. read more

Russia calls the conflict a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from people it describes as dangerous nationalists.

Meta has since narrowed its guidance to prohibit calls for the death of a head of state and said its guidance should never be interpreted as condoning violence against Russians in general. read more

But the perceived threat to its citizens angered Russian authorities and led to the criminal case against Meta.

WHATSAPP'S FATE

It was not immediately clear how the WhatsApp messaging service would be able to continue operating, since the court has put a stop to Meta's commercial activities.

Analysis of mobile internet traffic on Monday showed that Telegram, popular in Russia for a long time, has overtaken WhatsApp to become the country's most used messaging tool in recent weeks. read more

The prosecution sought to allay fears that people who find ways around bans on Meta's services may face criminal charges.

""Individuals will not be prosecuted simply for using Meta's services,"" TASS cited the prosecutor as saying in court.

But human rights lawyer Pavel Chikov said neither the court nor the prosecutor could guarantee the safety of Facebook or Instagram users, warning that any public displays of Meta symbols - on websites, shop entrances, on business cards - could be grounds for administrative charges and up to 15 days in jail.

""Buying adverts on both social networks or trading Meta's shares may qualify as financing extremism activity - this is a criminal offence,"" he wrote on Telegram.

WhatsApp may have been left alone due to the extent of its everyday use among Russians and by government agencies and state companies for customer support, Sarkis Darbinyan, head of the legal department at digital rights group Roskomsvoboda, said.

Another reason is likely to be to avoid any backlash.

""The government is trying not to close everything at once, but gradually, so that people slowly get used to it,"" he told Reuters, pointing to the ""unpopular"" closure of Instagram.

""We assume that services like WhatsApp could come under blocks at any moment,"" Darbinyan added.

WAY BACK FOR META?

Russia's military operation in Ukraine has added fuel to a simmering dispute between foreign digital platforms and Moscow.

Access to Twitter (TWTR.N) has also been restricted and on Friday Roskomnadzor demanded that Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google stop spreading what it called threats against Russian citizens on YouTube. read more

Anton Gorelkin, a member of Russia's State Duma committee on information and communications who has criticised foreign firms, while championing domestic alternatives, said the Russian market could be opened to Meta again, but only on Moscow's terms.

""These are an immediate end to blocking Russian media, a return to the policy of neutrality, and strict moderation of fakes and anti-Russian comments,"" Gorelkin said on Telegram.

Another condition, Gorelkin said, was that Meta comply with a law requiring foreign firms with more than 500,000 daily users to open representative offices in Russia. read more

131,META,2022-10-03,"Meta launches AI software tools to ease switching between Nvidia, AMD chips","













Oct 3 (Reuters) - Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O)said on Monday it has launched a new set of free software tools for artificial intelligence applications that could make it easier for developers to switch back and forth between different underlying chips.

Meta's new open-source AI platform is based on an open-source machine learning framework called PyTorch, and can help code run up to 12 times faster on Nvidia Corp's (NVDA.O) flagship A100 chip or up to four times faster on Advanced Micro Devices Inc's (AMD.O) MI250 chip, it said.

But just as important as the speed boost is the flexibility the sofware can provide, Meta said in a blog post.

Software has become a key battleground for chipmakers seeking to build up an ecosystem of developers to use their chips. Nvidia's CUDA platform has been the most popular so far for artificial intelligence work.

However, once developers tailor their code for Nvidia chips, it is difficult to run it on graphics processing units, or GPUs, from Nvidia competitors like AMD. Meta said the software is designed to easily swap between chips without being locked in.

""The unified GPU back-end support gives deep learning developers more hardware vendor choices with minimal migration costs,"" Meta said in its blog post.

Nvidia and AMD did not immediately return requests for comment.

Meta's software is made for AI work called inference, which is when machine learning algorithms that previously have been trained on huge amounts of data are called on to make quick judgments, such as deciding whether a photograph is of a cat or a dog.

""This is a software effort that is multi-platform. And it's a testament to the importance of software, particularly for deploying neural networks in machine learning for inference,"" said David Kanter, a founder of MLCommons, an independent group that measures AI speed.

Kanter added that this new Meta AI platform would be ""good for customer choice.""

June 21 (Reuters) - Meta (META.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and other tech giants racing to build the emerging metaverse concept have formed a group to foster development of industry standards that would make the companies' nascent digital worlds compatible with each other.

Participants in the Metaverse Standards Forum include many of the biggest companies working in the space, from chip makers to gaming companies, as well as established standards-setting bodies like the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the group said in an statement announcing its creation on Tuesday.

Conspicuously missing from the member list for now however is Apple (AAPL.O), which analysts expect to become a dominant player in the metaverse race once it introduces a mixed reality headset this year or next. read more

Gaming companies Roblox and Niantic also were not included among the forum's participants, nor were emerging crypto-based metaverse platforms like The Sandbox or Decentraland.

Apple has not yet publicly acknowledged plans for a headset, although it has reportedly given its board a sneak peek of the product, according to Bloomberg. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the new metaverse forum.

The logo of Meta Platforms is seen in Davos, Switzerland, May 22, 2022. Picture taken May 22, 2022. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo

Introducing such a device would put Apple in direct competition with Meta, which has staked its future on the growth of the metaverse and invested heavily in hardware to make its vision of interconnected virtual worlds a reality.

Meta, known as Facebook until it changed its name as part of its metaverse pivot last year, has disclosed plans for a mixed-reality headset code-named ""Cambria"" to be released this year.

Apple has been heavily involved in creating web standards such as HTML5 in the past. For three-dimensional content in the metaverse, Apple worked with Pixar on the ""USDZ"" file format and with Adobe to ensure it supported the format.

Neil Trevett, an executive at chip maker Nvidia who is chairing the Metaverse Standards Forum, said in a statement to Reuters that any company is welcome to join the group, including participants from the crypto world.

The forum aims to facilitate communication between a variety of standards organizations and companies to bring about ""real-world interoperability"" in the metaverse, he said, without addressing how Apple's absence would affect that goal.

133,META,2022-12-06,Meta Oversight Board calls for overhaul of controversial 'cross-check' system for VIPs,"













Dec 6 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms' (META.O) Oversight Board recommended on Tuesday that the company revamp its system exempting high-profile users from its rules, saying the practice privileged the powerful and allowed business interests to influence content decisions.

The arrangement, called cross-check, adds a layer of enforcement review for millions of Facebook and Instagram accounts belonging to celebrities, politicians and other influential users, allowing them extra leeway to post content that violates the company's policies.

Cross-check ""prioritizes users of commercial value to Meta and as structured does not meet Meta's human rights responsibilities and company values,"" Oversight Board director Thomas Hughes said in a statement announcing the decision.

The board had been reviewing the cross-check program since last year, when whistleblower Frances Haugen exposed the extent of the system by leaking internal company documents to the Wall Street Journal.

Those documents revealed that the program was both larger and more forgiving of influential users than Meta had previously told the Oversight Board, which is funded by the company through a trust and operates independently.

Without controls on eligibility or governance, cross-check sprawled to include nearly anyone with a substantial online following, although even with millions of members it represents a tiny slice of Meta's 3.7 billion total users.

In 2019, the system blocked the company's moderators from removing nude photos of a woman posted by Brazilian soccer star Neymar, even though the post violated Meta's rules against ""nonconsensual intimate imagery,"" according to the WSJ report.

The board at the time of the report rebuked Meta for not being ""fully forthcoming"" in its disclosures about cross-check.

In the opinion it issued on Tuesday, the board said it agreed that Meta needed mechanisms to address enforcement mistakes, given the extraordinary volume of user-generated content the company moderates each day.

However, it added, Meta ""has a responsibility to address these larger problems in ways that benefit all users and not just a select few.""

It made 32 recommendations that it said would structure the program more equitably, including transparency requirements, audits of the system's impact and a more systematic approach to eligibility.

State actors, it said, should continue to be eligible for inclusion in the program, but based only on publicly available criteria, with no other special preferences.

The Oversight Board's policy recommendations are not binding, but Meta is required to respond to them, normally within 60 days.

A spokeswoman for the Oversight Board said the company had asked for and received an extension in this case, so it would have 90 days to respond.

134,META,2023-02-01,"Meta stuns Street with lower costs, big buyback, upbeat sales","













Feb 1 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) stricter cost controls this year and a new $40 billion share buyback sent shares soaring on Wednesday, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg called 2023 the ""Year of Efficiency.""

The parent of Instagram and Facebook, which has fallen on hard times amid a broad post-pandemic slump in digital ads, is focused on improving its content recommendations powered by artificial intelligence and its ad targeting systems to keep users clicking.

Meanwhile, it will cut costs in 2023 by $5 billion to a range of $89 billion to $95 billion, a steep drop from the $94 billion to $100 billion it previously forecast, and it projected first-quarter sales that could beat Wall Street estimates.

Meta stock surged nearly 19% in after-hours trade. If gains hold on Thursday, it would set up the shares for their biggest intraday surge in a decade and added more than $75.5 billion to its existing $401 billion market capitalization.

Zuckerberg described the focus on efficiency as part of the natural evolution of the company, calling it a ""phase change"" for an organization that once lived by the motto ""move fast and break things.""

""We just grew so quickly for like the first 18 years,"" Zuckerberg said in a conference call. ""It's very hard to really crank on efficiency while you're growing that quickly. I just think we're in a different environment now.""

The cost cuts reflect Meta's updated plans for lower data-center construction expenses this year as part of a shift to a structure that can support both AI and non-AI work, it said in a statement.

The digital ad giant faced a brutal 2022 as companies cut back on marketing spending due to economic worries, while rivals like TikTok captured younger users and Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) privacy updates continued to challenge the business of placing targeted ads.

Meta in November cut more than 11,000 jobs in response, a precursor to the tens of thousands of layoffs in the tech industry that followed.

""Our management theme for 2023 is the 'Year of Efficiency' and we're focused on becoming a stronger and more nimble organization,"" Zuckerberg said in a statement.

Monetization efficiency for Reels on Facebook, a short-form video format, had doubled in the past six months and the business was on track to roughly break even by the end of 2023 or early 2024 and grow profitably after that, he said on the conference call.

INVESTMENTS STARTING TO PAY OFF

""Meta's better-than-feared results should refute concerns over the state of the digital advertising industry following Snap's horrible guidance earlier this week,"" said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.

""Despite all the challenges Meta must deal with, there are signs the business is still doing well,"" Cohen said.

Shares of peer Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) were up 3.3% while Snap Inc (SNAP.N) stock rose 1% in after-hours trade on Wednesday.

On the conference call, executives said Meta's investments in AI-surfaced content and TikTok competitor Reels were starting to pay off. The company also has been using AI to increase automation for advertisers and target ads using less personal data, resulting in higher return on ad spend.

Meta forecast first-quarter revenue between $26 billion and $28.5 billion. That was in with analysts' average estimates of $27.14 billion, according to Refinitiv.

Zuckerberg said generative AI - technology for producing original prose, imagery or computer code on command - would be the company's other big theme for this year, alongside efficiency.

Meta was planning to launch several new products that would ""empower creators to be way more productive and creative,"" he said, while cautioning about the cost associated with supporting the technology for a large user base.

However, net income for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 fell to $4.65 billion, or $1.76 per share, compared with $10.29 billion, or $3.67 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected a profit of $2.22 per share.

The decline was largely due to a $4.2 billion charge related to cost-cutting moves such as layoffs, office closures and the data center strategy overhaul.

The company previously said it was planning to account for much of that cost in 2023.

BRUSSELS, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta (META.O) reached out to EU antitrust regulators some time back in an attempt to settle investigations into its use of customer data and the tying of its classified advertisements service to its social network, people with direct knowledge said.

There were very preliminary discussions which so far have not made any progress, the people said.

The European Commission and Meta declined to comment.

""I am not surprised that there is no traction. You can better assess the exposure risk if you see something in writing like a statement of objections,"" said Tobias Caspary, a partner at London-based Fried Frank.

The EU competition enforcer launched an investigation into Facebook in June last year, focusing on whether the social network unfairly use advertisers' data to compete with them in the online classified ads sector.

A second investigation centres on whether Facebook ties its classified ads service Marketplace to its social network to give it an advantage in reaching customers and shut out rival online classified ad services.

The Commission is readying charges against the company, other people familiar with the matter told Reuters last month.

Companies sometimes seek to settle after receiving such charges.

Settling an antitrust investigation allows a company to stave off possible fines up to 10% of its global turnover. There would also be no finding of infringement, which could be helpful to ward off damages claims.

The Commission recently expanded its powers with landmark rules known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which makes it illegal for online gatekeepers to favour their own services or impose unfair access conditions to their app store.

Such a move could encourage Big Tech to settle ongoing EU investigations where they may have a say in determining possible remedies, unlike the DMA.

136,META,2023-02-02,Meta mojo is back as earnings surprise powers Big Tech rally,"













Feb 2 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) shares closed about 23% higher on Thursday and helped spark a rally in the technology sector after the Facebook owner floored Wall Street by slashing its spending forecast and boosting its stock buyback plan by $40 billion.

The company added more than $90 billion to its market value and the stock logged its best day in a decade. The surge also lifted shares of Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O), all of which sport valuations of more than $1 trillion and will report earnings after market close.

Meta's move to rein in costs marked a dramatic shift for a company that has spent billions of dollars to turn its vision of the futuristic metaverse into a reality, even while its core business reeled from stiff competition and a weak advertising market.

At least 24 analysts boosted their price targets on the stock after the results, with several saying that a combination of lower costs, upbeat revenue growth and share buybacks will drive up Meta's earnings per share.

""That is rare,"" analysts at Evercorse ISI said, referring to the positive developments. ""And stocks react to rare.""

The results on Wednesday also provided some relief to the market after an earnings meltdown at Snap Inc (SNAP.N) on Tuesday that had sent tech shares lower.

""After Snap's disaster, the fact that Meta wasn't quite so bad has brought encouragement to tech mega-caps,"" said Fiona Cincotta, analyst at City Index.

""There is also a less hawkish Fed (Federal Reserve), which is also boosting demand for growth and tech stocks generally.""

""YEAR OF EFFICIENCY""

Meta now expects its 2023 expenses between $89 billion and $95 billion, a sharp drop from its previous outlook of $94 billion to $100 billion, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg calling the period a ""Year of Efficiency"".

The forecast reflects savings from the 11,000 job cuts it announced in November, plans for lower data-center construction expenses and moves to drop non-crucial projects.

""Promising that 2023 will be a year of efficiency was always likely to go down well with investors concerned about the largesse in spending directed towards the unproven potential of the metaverse,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.

There were also signs that Meta's core social-media business was getting back on track, with monetization efficiency for short-form video Reels on Facebook doubling and the business being on track to break-even as soon as end of 2023.

The company, which forecast first-quarter revenue above market estimates, also said that Facebook's daily active user base grew to 2 billion from 1.98 billion in the prior quarter.

""Meta is getting its mojo back,"" Baird analysts said.

Nov 8 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) will begin laying off employees on Wednesday morning, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told hundreds of executives on Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Zuckerberg appeared downcast in Tuesday's meeting and said he was accountable for the company's missteps and his overoptimism about growth had led to overstaffing, the report added, citing people familiar with the matter.

He described broad cuts and specifically mentioned the recruiting and business teams as among those facing layoffs, the report said, adding an internal announcement of the company's layoff plans is expected around 6 a.m. Eastern time on Wednesday.

The specific employees losing their jobs will be informed over the course of the morning, the report said.

Meta's head of human resources, Lori Goler, said employees who lose their jobs will be provided with at least four months of salary as severance, the WSJ reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Meta reported more than 87,000 employees at the end of September.

The company declined to comment on the report.

The development comes after Twitter laid off half its workforce across teams ranging from communications and content curation to product and engineering following Elon Musk's $44 billion takeover.

However, Bloomberg on Sunday reported Twitter was reaching out to dozens of employees who lost their jobs, asking them to return.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) also laid off around 1,000 employees across several divisions in October, according to an Axios report.

AMSTERDAM, June 10 (Reuters) - The Dutch government will not yet sell land in the city of Zeewolde to Facebook owner Meta , news agency ANP reported on Friday, citing remarks by the country's housing minister.

ANP cited Hugo de Jonge as saying the company had not met conditions to use the land.

In March, Meta put plans to build the large data centre on hold due to political opposition. While the Dutch government initially sought to attract foreign investment in data centres, public opinion has turned against them for their perceived disproportionate use of renewable energy. read more

April 19 (Reuters) - An appeal has been launched against a Moscow court ruling that banned Meta (FB.O) from operating in Russia on the grounds of ""extremist activity"", Interfax news agency said on Tuesday.

Interfax initially reported that Meta itself had lodged the appeal but then cited the court press service as saying it had been filed by an unidentified third party.

The court could not immediately be reached for further clarification. A Meta spokesperson had no immediate comment.

The Moscow court ruling was delivered on March 21, confirming bans on Meta's Facebook and Instagram social networks that Russia had already imposed. Its WhatsApp messaging service was not affected.

Russia initially banned Facebook for restricting access to Russian media, while Instagram was blocked after Moscow objected to temporary changes in Meta's hate speech policy designed to allow users to vent their anger over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. read more

At the March court hearing, Meta's lawyer said the company was not carrying out extremist activities and was opposed to Russophobia. read more

Facebook last year had 7.5 million users in Russia and WhatsApp had 67 million, researcher Insider Intelligence estimates, while Instagram has said its ban will affect 80 million users in Russia.

LA MACARENA, Colombia July 13 (Reuters) - Colombia's Meta province, long dependent on oil and gas production for its wealth, is hoping a focus on tourism can help grow its income and support hundreds of families in the region, local officials told Reuters.

The province is home to the La Macarena national park, which includes Cano Cristales, a river that is also known as ""the river of the gods,"" or ""the river of seven colors,"" among other descriptive labels.

Colombia's president-elect, Gustavo Petro, has pledged to end the Andean country's reliance on oil and coal exports, with a shift to focusing on tourism dollars to boost the economy.

More than half of Meta's economy depends on producing hydrocarbons, but the provincial government plans to invest $40 million in tourism infrastructure to benefit 50% of the region's municipalities, Luis Carlos Londono, director of Meta's tourism institute, told Reuters.

Local authorities are betting on Meta's natural treasures to bring in flocks of tourists, and help it phase out its reliance on oil.

The region, once held by the now demobilized FARC guerrillas, receives some 14,000 tourists each year, which directly supports 600 families.

""If Colombia realized how great a diversity of incredible landscapes, cultures and colors it has, I think it would be a major source of income,"" tourist Viviana Ramirez, 25, said while visiting the river.

141,META,2022-09-27,Meta says it removes China-based propaganda operation targeting U.S. midterms,"













Sept 27 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms (META.O) said on Tuesday it disrupted the first known China-based influence operation focused on targeting users in the United States with political content ahead of the midterm elections in November.

The network maintained fake accounts across Meta's social media platforms Facebook and Instagram, as well as competitor service Twitter , but was small and did not attract much of a following, Meta said in a report summarizing its findings.

Still, the report noted, the discovery was significant because it suggested a shift toward more direct interference in U.S. domestic politics compared with previous known Chinese propaganda efforts.

""The Chinese operations we've taken down before talked primarily about America to the world, primarily in South Asia, not to Americans about themselves,"" Meta global threat intelligence lead Ben Nimmo told a press briefing.

""Essentially the message was 'America bad, China good,'"" he said of those operations, while the new operation pushed messages aimed at Americans on both sides of divisive issues like abortion and gun rights.

Another Meta executive at the briefing said the company did not have enough evidence to say who in China was behind the activity.

Asked about Meta's findings at a news conference, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said his office was ""very concerned"" about intelligence reports of election interference by foreign governments ""starting back some time ago and continuing all the way into the present.""

A Twitter spokesperson said the company was aware of the information in Meta's report and also took down the accounts.

According to Meta's report, the Chinese fake accounts posed as liberal and conservative Americans in different states. They posted political memes and lurked in the comments of public figures' posts since November 2021.

A sample screenshot showed one account commenting on a Facebook post by Republican Senator Marco Rubio, asking him to stop gun violence and using the hashtag #RubioChildrenKiller.

The same network also set up fake accounts that posed as people in the Czech Republic criticizing the Czech government over its approach to China, according to the report.

Meta also said it had intercepted the largest and most complex Russian-based operation since the war in Ukraine began, describing it as a sprawling network of more than 60 websites impersonating legitimate news organizations, along with about 4,000 social media accounts and petitions on sites like U.S.-based campaign group Avaaz.

That operation primarily targeted users in Germany, as well as France, Italy, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, and spent more than $100,000 on ads promoting pro-Russian messages.

On a few occasions, Russian embassies in Europe and Asia amplified the content.

The Russian embassy in Washington said Meta's move follows ""the instructions of the U.S. authorities"" and is a violation of freedom of speech.

""This suggests that American tech giants, who own the most popular Internet resources, have become servants of the U.S. administration's policy of suppressing dissent,"" the embassy said on its Telegram channel.

142,META,2022-12-23,Facebook parent Meta to settle Cambridge Analytica scandal case for $725 million,"Companies Meta Platforms Inc Follow















Dec 23 (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) has agreed to pay $725 million to resolve a class-action lawsuit accusing the social media giant of allowing third parties, including Cambridge Analytica, to access users' personal information.

The proposed settlement, which was disclosed in a court filing late on Thursday, would resolve a long-running lawsuit prompted by revelations in 2018 that Facebook had allowed the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to access data of as many as 87 million users.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs called the proposed settlement the largest to ever be achieved in a U.S. data privacy class action and the most that Meta has ever paid to resolve a class action lawsuit.

""This historic settlement will provide meaningful relief to the class in this complex and novel privacy case,"" the lead lawyers for the plaintiffs, Derek Loeser and Lesley Weaver, said in a joint statement.

Meta did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement, which is subject to the approval of a federal judge in San Francisco. The company said in a statement settling was ""in the best interest of our community and shareholders.""

""Over the last three years we revamped our approach to privacy and implemented a comprehensive privacy program,"" Meta said.

Cambridge Analytica, now defunct, worked for Donald Trump's successful presidential campaign in 2016, and gained access to the personal information from millions of Facebook accounts for the purposes of voter profiling and targeting.

Cambridge Analytica obtained that information without users' consent from a researcher who had been allowed by Facebook to deploy an app on its social media network that harvested data from millions of its users.

The ensuing Cambridge Analytica scandal fueled government investigations into its privacy practices, lawsuits and a high-profile U.S. congressional hearing where Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg was grilled by lawmakers.

In 2019, Facebook agreed to pay $5 billion to resolve a Federal Trade Commission probe into its privacy practices and $100 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission claims that it misled investors about the misuse of users' data.

Investigations by state attorneys general are ongoing, and the company is fighting a lawsuit by the attorney general for Washington, D.C.

Thursday's settlement resolved claims by Facebook users that the company violated various federal and state laws by letting app developers and business partners harvest their personal data without their consent on a widespread basis.

The users' lawyers alleged that Facebook misled them into thinking they could keep control over personal data, when in fact it let thousands of preferred outsiders gain access.

Facebook argued its users have no legitimate privacy interest in information they shared with friends on social media. But U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria called that view ""so wrong"" and in 2019 largely allowed the case to move forward.

The settlement covers an estimated 250 to 280 million Facebook users, according to Thursday's court filing. How much an individual user receives will depend on how many people submit valid claims for a share of the settlement.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs say they plan to ask the judge to award them up to 25% of the settlement as attorneys' fees, equaling about $181 million.

143,META,2023-01-31,U.S. FTC asks judge to pause Meta deal for VR company Within,"













WASHINGTON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday asked a judge to put a hold on Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) deal to buy virtual reality app maker Within Unlimited while the two sides await a decision from the court.

The FTC sued the Facebook and Instagram owner in July to stop the Within deal and asked the judge to order a preliminary injunction, saying Meta's ""campaign to conquer VR"" began in 2014 when it acquired Oculus, a VR headset manufacturer. There was a trial on the case in December.

The agency asked for the court to order Meta to refrain from closing its deal for Within until 11:59 p.m. Pacific time on the first business day after the judge rules on whether the deal may go forward. Or, the agency said in a court filing, the judge could extend the existing temporary restraining order for 7 days.

The current restraining order expires at 11:59 Pacific time Tuesday night.

The fight to determine if Meta could go forward with this relatively small deal is seen as a test of the FTC's bid to head off what it sees as a repeat of the company acquiring small upcoming would-be rivals to secure dominance, this time in the nascent virtual and augmented reality markets.

May 23 (Reuters) - New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli is calling for votes against directors at Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and at Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc at their upcoming annual meetings, saying both companies failed to enforce their standards against harmful content including from a mass shooting in Buffalo, N.Y. on May 14.

In letters seen by Reuters and sent to each companies' boards ahead of events both scheduled for May 25, Thomas DiNapoli, who oversees New York's pension fund, cited reports the companies did not remove video clips and screenshots of the shooter's livestream, and his alleged racist manifesto, from their platforms.

Such gaps help radicalize individuals and lead to calls for further social media regulation, DiNapoli wrote. He told both boards that until they can show an ""ability to successfully oversee the company’s content management policies, the Fund will continue voting against directors"" and called on other investors to do the same.

Asked about the letters, a Twitter representative said it is taking steps including ""removing videos and media related to the incident, as well as Tweets that contain third-party links to manifesto and videos of the attack.""

Although the company is under agreement to be purchased by Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk for $44 billion, he has tweeted the deal is ""temporarily on hold"" and a long delay or cancellation could renew the importance of the annual meeting where two directors are up for election. read more

""We cannot assume the transaction will close,"" a spokesman for DiNapoli said.

Meta said it quickly designated the shooting as a ""terrorist attack"" that triggered a process to remove the suspect's account and other material. ""We have teams working around the clock across Meta to identify, remove, and block violating content related to the shooting,"" Meta said in a statement sent by a representative.

April 7 (Reuters) - Facebook-owner Meta (FB.O) has removed hacking campaigns, influence networks and scam operations amid the war in Ukraine, according to a report released on Thursday by the social media company, which also said it was reviewing additional steps to address misinformation from Russian government pages.

""We're constantly reviewing our policies based on the evolving situation on the ground and we are actively now reviewing additional steps to address misinformation and hoaxes coming from Russian government pages,"" said Meta's president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, on a call with reporters.

Russia has battled big tech companies to control online information flows after its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation."" It has banned Facebook and Instagram, and throttled Twitter (TWTR.N) by slowing its service. Twitter said this week it will not amplify or recommend Russian government accounts to users. read more

In its first quarterly adversarial threat report, Meta said government-linked actors from Russia and Belarus had engaged in cyber espionage and covert online influence operations, including an influence operation linked to the Belarusian KGB.

It said there had been other continued attempts from networks it had previously disrupted, including further efforts by the threat actor Ghostwriter to hack the Facebook accounts of dozens of Ukraine military members. read more

Meta said in the report it had also removed a network of about 200 accounts operated from Russia that coordinated to falsely report people, mostly in Ukraine and Russia, for violations like hate speech or bullying.

The mass reporting was primarily coordinated in a cooking-themed Facebook Group which had about 50 members when Meta took it down in March.

Meta said it had also removed tens of thousands of accounts, pages and groups trying to use the war in Ukraine to scam users and make money by driving people to ad-filled websites or selling them merchandise. It said spammers around the world had used tactics such as streaming live-gaming videos or reposting popular content including other people's videos from Ukraine to pretend they were sharing live updates from the crisis.

Meta detailed other takedowns including the removal of two cyberespionage operations from Iran, an influence campaign in Brazil that posed as environmental activists defending deforestation in the Amazon, and a network in the Philippines that claimed credit for bringing down and defacing news websites.

Nov 2 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms (META.O) on Wednesday said it was adding a host of new features to Instagram, including a tool to trade digital collectibles, in a move that will help content creators monetize their presence on the social media platform.

Users can soon support creators by buying their non-fungible tokens (NFTs) directly within Instagram, the company said.

The new features will be tested with a small group of creators in the United States, the company said, and added that it plans to expand to more countries soon.

Meta has been rolling out more features for users to make money on its social media apps as it competes for talent with TikTok and others at a time when influencers are pulling in advertising dollars to these platforms.

In tandem with this push, Meta said it was expanding access to subscriptions on Instagram to all eligible creators in the United States to help them earn a more predictable income on the photo-sharing app.

It is also introducing gifts on Instagram, starting with Reels, so creators have a new way to earn money from their fan base.

The company is also launching a professional mode for Facebook profiles, which will allow creators to build a public presence while maintaining their personal Facebook profile.

Sept 21 (Reuters) - Meta Inc (META.O) is looking to trim its costs by at least 10% within the next few months, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the company's plans.

The reported figure represents a big jump from the earlier forecast of about 2% to 4% cost cuts that Meta announced in July. (https://on.wsj.com/3Lv3G9s)

To meet its latest target, the Facebook parent has already started nudging out a large number of staffers by reorganizing departments and providing affected employees a limited window to apply for other roles within Meta, the report said.

The idea behind the move is to achieve staffing cuts while forestalling the mass issuance of pink slips, and the reductions are expected to be a prelude to deeper cuts, according to the report.

Meta on Wednesday reiterated its plans to steadily reduce headcount growth over the next year in an emailed response.

The company's business has taken a hit in recent months as recession fears and competitive pressures hit digital ads sales.

Reuters had reported in June that Meta had cut plans to hire engineers by at least 30% this year as it prepares for a deep economic downturn.

REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo















NAIROBI, Feb 6 (Reuters) - A labour court in Kenya ruled on Monday that Meta (META.O), the parent company of Facebook, can be sued in the East African country after a former content moderator filed a lawsuit against it alleging poor working conditions.

The lawsuit was filed by one person on behalf of a group and was also filed against Meta's local outsourcing company Sama. It seeks financial compensation, an order that outsourced moderators have the same healthcare and pay scale as Meta employees, that unionisation rights be protected and an independent human rights audit of the office.

The decision from Kenya's employment and labour relations court could have implications for how Meta works with content moderators globally. The U.S. company works with thousands of moderators around the world, tasked with reviewing graphic content posted on its platform.

Meta had argued that the Kenyan court had no jurisdiction because the company is not based in the African country, and thus should be struck from the case.

""Since the petition has raised certain actual issues that are yet to be determined, it would be inopportune for the country to strike out the two respondents from the matter,"" Judge Jacob Gakeri said in his ruling on Monday.

Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Former content moderator Daniel Motaung, who says he developed PTSD because of his work, filed the case.

Meta has faced lawsuits over content moderation before.

In 2021 a California judge approved an $85 million settlement between Facebook and more than 10,000 content moderators who had accused the company of failing to protect them from psychological injuries resulting from their exposure to graphic and violent imagery.

Meta is also facing another lawsuit in Kenya. In December, two Ethiopian researchers and a Kenyan rights group filed a suit accusing Meta of letting violent and hateful posts from Ethiopia flourish on Facebook, inflaming the Ethiopian civil war.

Meta said hate speech and incitement to violence were against the rules of Facebook and Instagram, another of its platforms, and that it was investing heavily to remove this type of content.

Meta's local outsourcing company Sama said last month it would no longer provide content moderation services for the company.

Sama has previously rejected claims that its employees were paid unfairly, that the recruitment process was opaque, or that its mental health benefits were inadequate.

The ""Online News Act,"" or House of Commons bill C-18, introduced in April last year laid out rules to force platforms like Meta and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google to negotiate commercial deals and pay news publishers for their content.

""A legislative framework that compels us to pay for links or content that we do not post, and which are not the reason the vast majority of people use our platforms, is neither sustainable nor workable,"" a Meta spokesperson said as reason to suspend news access in the country.

Meta's move comes after Google last month started testing limited news censorship as a potential response to the bill.

Canada's news media industry has asked the government for more regulation of tech companies to allow the industry to recoup financial losses it has suffered in the years as tech giants like Google and Meta steadily gain greater market share of advertising.

In a statement on Sunday, Canadian Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez said it was disappointing to see Facebook resorting to threats instead of working with the Canadian government in good faith, and the C-18 bill had nothing to do with how Facebook makes news available to Canadians.

""All we're asking Facebook to do is negotiate fair deals with news outlets when they profit from their work,"" Rodriguez said. ""This is part of a disappointing trend this week that tech giants would rather pull news than pay their fair share.""

Facebook last year raised concerns about the legislation and warned it might be forced to block news-sharing on its platform.

152,META,2022-04-18,Meta institutional investors urge opposing re-election of two board members,"













April 18 (Reuters) - A group representing some of Meta Platforms Inc's (FB.O) institutional investors urged shareholders of the Facebook owner to vote against the re-election of two of its board members, Marc Andreessen and Peggy Alford.

""We believe the lack of independence of board members Peggy Alford and Marc L. Andreessen is undermining the board's ability to adequately oversee the management team and represent shareholders' best interests,"" said Shareholder Association for Research and Education (SHARE) in a filing.

The group of 15 shareholders, including SHARE, the Illinois State Treasurer and Arjuna Capital, instead urged the nomination of new, highly-qualified independent directors, according to the filing.

Peggy Alford, an executive at PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O), joined Meta's board in 2019, whereas venture capitalist Marc Andreessen has served on the company's board since June 2008.

The shareholders also urged the board to implement certain governance reforms, including eliminating the dual-class structure and separating the functions of chief executive officer and chairman. SHARE added that Meta's board did not respond to discuss these matters.

Meta, which is scheduled to hold its annual meeting on May 25, declined to comment.

153,META,2023-02-24,Meta heats up Big Tech's AI arms race with new language model,"













Feb 24 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) said on Friday it was releasing to researchers a new large language model, the core software of a new artificial intelligence system, heating up an AI arms race as Big Tech companies rush to integrate the technology into their products and impress investors.

The public battle to dominate the AI technology space kicked off late last year with the launch of Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT and prompted tech heavyweights from Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) to China's Baidu Inc (9888.HK), to trumpet their own offerings.

Meta's LLaMA, short for Large Language Model Meta AI, will be available under non-commercial license to researchers and entities affiliated with government, civil society, and academia, it said in a blog.

Large language models mine vast amounts of text in order to summarize information and generate content. They can answer questions, for instance, with sentences that can read as though written by humans.

The model, which Meta said requires ""far less"" computing power than previous offerings, is trained on 20 languages with a focus on those with Latin and Cyrillic alphabets.

""Meta's announcement today appears to be a step in testing their generative AI capabilities so they can implement them into their products in the future,"" said Gil Luria, senior software analyst at D.A. Davidson.

""Generative AI is a new application of AI that Meta has less experience with, but is clearly important for the future of their business.""

AI has emerged as a bright spot for investments in the tech industry, whose slowing growth has prompted widespread layoffs and a cutback on experimental bets.

Meta said LLaMA could outperform competitors that examine more parameters, or variables that the algorithm takes into account.

Specifically, it said a version of LLaMA with 13 billion parameters can outperform GPT-3, a recent predecessor to the model on which ChatGPT is built.

It described its 65-billion-parameter LLaMA model as ""competitive"" with Google's Chinchilla70B and PaLM-540B, which are even larger than the model that Google used to show off its Bard chat-powered search.

A Meta spokeswoman attributed the performance to a larger quantity of ""cleaner"" data and ""architectural improvements"" in the model that enhanced training stability.

Meta in May last year released large language model OPT-175B, also aimed at researchers, which formed the basis of a new iteration of its chatbot BlenderBot.

It later introduced a model called Galactica, which could write scientific articles and solve math problems, but quickly pulled down the demo after it generated authoritative-sounding false responses.

154,META,2023-03-07,Meta plans to cut thousands of jobs as soon as this week - Bloomberg News,"













March 7 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) will cut thousands of jobs as soon as this week in a fresh round of layoffs, Bloomberg News reported on Monday, only a few months after the Facebook-parent reduced more than 11,000 people from its workforce.

The new round of job cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the ""flattening,"" the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

Meta declined to comment on the Bloomberg report when contacted by Reuters.

Last month, the Washington Post newspaper had reported that Meta was planning to cut jobs in a reorganization and downsizing effort.

Meta, at that time, declined to comment, but spokesperson Andy Stone in a series of tweets cited several previous statements by Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg suggesting that more cuts were on the way.

Meta's mass layoffs in November that cut more than 11,000 jobs was among the biggest last year and the first in the company's history. Other tech companies, including Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), have also cut thousands of jobs.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo















April 13 (Reuters) - Facebook parent Meta Platforms (FB.O) will charge creators around 47.5% on sales of digital assets and experiences made inside the company's virtual reality platform Horizon Worlds.

The overall charge comprises of 30% hardware platform fee for sales made through Meta Quest Store, where it sells apps and games meant for its virtual reality headsets, and a further 17.5% cut as its Horizon platform fees, a Meta spokesperson told Reuters on Wednesday.

On Monday, the tech giant said it would start testing tools for creators to sell digital assets and in turn make money on Horizon Worlds, a key part of its plan for creating a metaverse. read more

Meta chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has been a critic of Apple Inc's app store fees of 30%, but Meta's latest move to charge creators nearly half their sales on its own platform has angered many of them.

The Facebook parent company, which changed its name to Meta last year, has invested heavily in virtual and augmented reality to reflect its new bet on the metaverse, a futuristic idea of a network of virtual environments accessed via different devices where users can work, socialize and play.

Meta's Horizon Worlds, an expansive VR social platform, and Horizon Venues, which is focused on virtual events, are early iterations of metaverse-like spaces.

SEOUL, Sept 14 (Reuters) - South Korea levied tens of millions of dollars in fines on Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google and Meta Platforms (META.O) for privacy law violations, authorities said on Wednesday.

In a statement, the Personal Information Protection Commission said it fined Google 69.2 billion won ($50 million) and Meta 30.8 billion won ($22 million).

The privacy panel said the firms did not clearly inform service users and obtain their prior consent when collecting and analysing behavioural information to infer their interests or use them for customised advertisements.

""We disagree with the PIPC’s findings, and will be reviewing the full written decision once it’s shared with us,"" a Google spokesperson said.

""We’ve always demonstrated our commitment to making ongoing updates that give users control and transparency, while providing the most helpful products possible. We remain committed to engaging with the PIPC to protect the privacy of South Korean users.""

A Meta spokesperson said, ""While we respect the commission's decision, we are confident that we work with our clients in a legally compliant way that meets the processes required by local regulations. As such, we do not agree with the commission's decision, and will be open to all options including seeking a ruling from the court.""

Also on Wednesday, Google suffered its second setback in Europe in less than a year as the top court agreed with EU antitrust regulators that it had abused its dominance. Google lost its challenge to a 2.42 billion euro ($2.42 billion) fine last year, the first of a trio of cases, though the EU Court of Justice did trim it slightly. read more

158,META,2023-02-21,Tencent in talks with Meta to sell Quest VR headsets in China - sources,"













HONG KONG, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) is in talks with Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) to distribute its Meta Quest line of virtual reality headsets in China, three people familiar with the matter said.

The talks between Tencent and Meta started last year and have continued in recent months, according to one of the sources who has direct knowledge of the matter, adding that the talks remain early stage and details have yet to be agreed.

Tencent and Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. The people declined to be identified because the talks are not public.

Chinese media outlet 36Kr and the Wall Street Journal reported the discussions earlier.

Tencent, the world's largest video game publisher, had ambitious plans to build both virtual reality software and hardware at an ""extended reality"" XR unit it launched in June last year amid swelling global interest in the metaverse concept of a virtual world.

But Reuters reported last week that it had decided to quit developing its own XR hardware due in part to profitability issues, and told most employees in the unit to find opportunities elsewhere.

Tencent said at the time it was making adjustments to some business teams as development plans for hardware had changed

One of its main rivals in China's virtual reality space is TikTok owner ByteDance, which owns headset manufacturer Pico.

Tencent is mostly known for software that includes a suite of games and social media applications. It sells the Nintendo Switch console in China through a partnership with the Japanese gaming firm (7974.T) established four years ago.

159,META,2022-09-15,"YouTube, Meta will expand policies, research to fight online extremism","













Sept 15 (Reuters) - Major tech companies on Thursday committed to taking fresh steps to combat online extremism by removing more violent content and promoting media literacy with young users, as part of a White House summit on fighting hate-fueled violence.

Platforms like Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) YouTube and Meta Platforms' (META.O) Facebook have come under fire for years from critics who say the companies have allowed hate speech, lies and violent rhetoric to flourish on their services.

U.S. President Joe Biden earlier on Thursday called on Americans to combat racism and extremism during a summit at the White House that gathered experts and survivors and included bipartisan local leaders. read more

YouTube said it will expand its policies on violent extremism to remove content that glorifies violent acts, even if the creators of the videos are not related to a terrorist organization.

The video streaming site already prohibits violent incitement, but in at least some cases has not applied existing policies to videos promoting militia groups involved with the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol.

A report by the Tech Transparency Project in May found 435 pro-militia videos on YouTube, including 85 posted since the Jan. 6 attack. Some of the videos gave training advice, like how to carry out guerilla-style ambushes.

YouTube spokesman Jack Malon declined to say whether the service would change its approach to that content under the new policy, but said the update enables it to go further with enforcement than it had previously.

YouTube also said it will launch a media literacy campaign to teach younger users how to spot the manipulation tactics that are used to spread misinformation.

Microsoft (MSFT.O) said it will make a basic and more affordable version of its artificial intelligence and machine learning tools available to schools and smaller organizations in order to help them detect and prevent violence.

Facebook owner Meta announced it will partner with researchers from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies' Center on Terrorism, Extremism and Counterterrorism.

Last year, lawmakers grilled the chief executives of Alphabet and Facebook, as well as Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), on whether their companies bore some responsibility for the Jan. 6 attack.

160,META,2023-02-06,Law firms in Meta antitrust lawsuit clash over lead role,"Summary

Summary Companies Judge scrapped prior order appointing both firms as co-counsel

Quinn Emanuel denies discounting female attorney at Hagens Berman















Feb 6(Reuters) - Two major U.S. law firms are feuding over which one will lead a consumer antitrust class action against Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) Facebook, after a judge scrapped a prior order appointing them both as co-leaders for the plaintiffs and started from scratch.

U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco said in January that he would make a new determination to select one of the firms to lead the class action amid quarreling between Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro and Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. Part of the clash included a Hagens Berman partner accusing Quinn Emanuel of discounting her views based on her gender. Quinn Emanuel denied the allegation, calling it a ""mystery.""

""I have significant experience-based qualms about these multi-headed plaintiff-side structures,"" Donato said at a recent hearing in the case, as he heard about the dispute and wiped out a 2021 order by another judge who appointed both firms. ""You don't need them.""

The underlying case involves class claims from consumers and advertisers that Facebook exploited user data to maintain its market power. The company has denied the allegations from both sets of class plaintiffs.

The two law firms on Friday night submitted their pitches to Donato about why he should appoint them solely rather than jointly to lead the consumer class.

In its filing, Quinn Emanuel said partner Kevin Teruya was the ""architect of the consumer class's case."" Hagens Berman in its submission questioned Quinn Emanuel's rates, suggesting they were too high.

Plaintiffs' firms routinely vie for court-appointed leadership roles in class actions, allowing them to steer litigation and potentially to recover bigger portions of legal fees in cases that settle or win at trial.

A representative from Hagens Berman did not immediately comment, and a Quinn Emanuel spokesperson declined to comment.

The lawyers who are seeking to lead the consumer class — Shana Scarlett of Hagens Berman and Teruya of Quinn Emanuel — did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

In court last month, Scarlett said ""this case has presented a set of circumstances where I feel that my voice has not been equally heard."" Teruya said at the hearing that his firm has ""worked very hard to be cooperative with all counsel on the case, including female counsel.""

Donato told the lawyers ""it sounds like it's been more than just honest differences of opinion.""

Hagens Berman is a 80-lawyer plaintiffs' firm based in Seattle, and Los Angeles-based Quinn Emanuel, with more than 900 attorneys, represents plaintiffs while also defending companies in business litigation. Hagens Berman and Quinn Emanuel have been on opposite sides in other cases.

The case is Klein v. Meta Platforms Inc, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 5:20-cv-08570.

161,META,2023-02-04,U.S. judge denies FTC request to stop Meta from acquiring VR firm Within,"













WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - A judge on Friday released a ruling denying the Federal Trade Commission's request to stop Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) from buying virtual reality content maker Within Unlimited, rejecting the regulator's concerns the deal would reduce competition in a new market.

A December trial to decide if Meta could go forward with the relatively small deal was seen as a test of the FTC's bid to head off what it sees as a repeat of the company acquiring small upcoming would-be rivals to dominate a market, this time in the nascent virtual and augmented reality markets.

The ruling had been issued in a sealed form earlier this week. The version issued on Friday evening was redacted.

A Meta spokesperson said the Facebook and Instagram owner was ""pleased that the Court has denied the FTC’s motion to block our acquisition of Within.""

""We look forward to closing the transaction soon,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

The FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Judge Edward Davila of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California said the FTC had failed to show that Meta would have entered the market to make dedicated fitness content if it was unable to buy Within.

""Though Meta boasts considerable financial and VR engineering resources, it did not possess the capabilities unique to VR dedicated fitness apps, specifically fitness content creation and studio production facilities,"" the judge wrote.

The decision is good news for Meta boss and founder Mark Zuckerberg, who defended the acquisition in testimony in December, arguing that his company was helping to build but not dominate the virtual reality industry.

Zuckerberg had testified in federal court in San Jose, California, that owning Within was ""not that critical"" to Meta's ambitions and that it was ""less important that we own the experiences than that they exist.""

The FTC sued Meta in July to stop the Within deal, asking the judge to order a preliminary injunction, saying Meta's ""campaign to conquer VR"" began in 2014 when it acquired Oculus, a VR headset manufacturer.

WASHINGTON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Antitrust enforcers who have asked a federal judge to stop Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) from buying virtual reality content maker Within filed a shorter version of their complaint on Friday.

The Federal Trade Commission had filed a lawsuit in July saying that Meta's acquisition of Within Unlimited Inc would ""tend to create a monopoly"" in the market for virtual reality-dedicated fitness apps. read more

The amended complaint focuses on the virtual reality dedicated exercise app market. One of these apps is Within's Supernatural, which is available only on Meta's VR devices. It argues that the proposed deal would ""substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly"" in that market.

The complaint drops allegations related to the broader VR fitness app market which also includes dance apps and others that encourage physical activity but are not purely focused on exercise.

Meta, which has said it would fight the lawsuit, said, ""What remains of the FTC's case are speculative claims that continue to lack support in either the facts or the law.""

Summary Companies Meta Platforms rallies after report of job cuts

Apple slips as COVID-19 curbs crimp iPhone production in China

Indexes close: S&P 500 +0.96%, Nasdaq +0.85%, Dow +1.31%















Nov 7 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply higher Monday as investors focused on Tuesday's midterm elections that will determine control of Congress, while shares of Meta Platforms jumped on a report of job cuts at the Facebook parent.

Republicans are favored to win a majority in the House of Representatives in the elections, with the Senate rated a toss-up by nonpartisan forecasters. Republicans could use a majority in either chamber to hinder Democratic President Joe Biden's agenda.

""The likelihood that the Republicans take the House or the Senate is pretty high, therefore guaranteeing some form of gridlock over the next couple of years. That would probably take tax hikes off the table, and any sort of big spending potentially perceived as inflationary off the table,"" said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategy analyst at Baird.

Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) jumped over 6% following a report that the company was planning to begin large-scale layoffs this week. The stock has slumped more than 70% so far this year.

Recently beaten-down shares of Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) each rallied more than 2% and contributed heavily to the S&P 500's gain for the session.

Focus this week will also be on U.S. consumer prices data for October, due out on Thursday, for clues about how much the U.S. Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate hikes are helping cool down the economy.

Four Fed policymakers on Friday indicated they would consider a smaller rate hike at their next policy meeting, despite new data showing another month of robust job gains and only small signs of progress in lowering inflation.

Traders are divided about whether the Fed will raise interest rates by 50 basis points or 75 basis points at the U.S. central bank's meeting in December.

""All else equal, whether the terminal rate sits at 4.5%, 5% or beyond, monetary policy is poised to have a negative effect on the economy heading into 2023,"" Glenmede's investment strategists wrote in a note on Monday.

Unofficially, the S&P 500 climbed 0.96% to end the session at 3,806.90 points.

Of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes, eight rose, led by communication services (.SPLRCL) which was up 1.83%, followed by a 1.73% gain in energy (.SPNY).

All the three major U.S. indexes have slumped this year, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq (.IXIC) down 33% due to worries that aggressive monetary policy tightening could cripple the U.S. economy.

Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC.O) surged 66% after former U.S. President Donald Trump hinted at another White House bid. The blank-check firm has agreed to take social-media startup Trump Media & Technology Group Corp public.

Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) gained 4.1% after VillageMD, a primary care provider backed by the pharmacy chain, said it will acquire Summit Health in a deal valued at nearly $9 billion.

Advancing issues outnumbered falling ones within the S&P 500 (.AD.SPX) by a 2.8-to-one ratio.

The S&P 500 posted 18 new highs and 15 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 93 new highs and 221 new lows.

164,META,2022-08-30,"Australia demands Apple, Meta, Microsoft share anti-abuse steps, threatens fines","













SYDNEY, Aug 30 (Reuters) - An Australian regulator sent legal letters to Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) demanding they share their strategies for stamping out child abuse material on their platforms or face fines.

The e-Safety Commissioner, a body set up to protect internet users, said it used laws which took effect in January to compel the technology giants to disclose measures they were taking to detect and remove abuse material within 28 days. If they did not, the companies would each face a fine of A$555,000 ($383,000) per day.

The threat underscores Australia's hardline approach to regulating Big Tech firms since 2021 which has so far included laws forcing them to pay media outlets for displaying their content and laws making them hand over details of anonymous accounts which post defamatory material.

The internet firms have meanwhile been under pressure around the world to find a way to monitor encrypted messaging and streaming services for child abuse material without encroaching on user privacy. read more

""This activity is no longer confined to hidden corners of the dark web but is prevalent on the mainstream platforms we and our children use every day,"" said commissioner Julie Inman Grant in a statement.

[1/3] Meta logo is seen in this illustration taken, August 22, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration 1 2 3

""As more companies move towards encrypted messaging services and deploy features like livestreaming, the fear is that this horrific material will spread unchecked on these platforms,"" she added.

A spokeperson for Microsoft, which owns video calling service Skype, said the company had received the letter and planned to respond within 28 days.

A spokesperson for Meta, which also owns messaging service WhatsApp, said the company was still reviewing the letter but continued to ""proactively engage with the eSafety Commissioner on these important issues"".

Apple, which owns video messaging service FaceTime, messaging service iMessage and photo storing service iCloud, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

The eSafety Commissioner referred to figures provided by the U.S. National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, which said this year it had received 29.1 million reports of child abuse material from internet companies, of which just 160 were from Apple while 22 million were from Facebook.

165,META,2022-04-23,"EU sets new online rules for Google, Meta to curb illegal content","













BRUSSELS, April 23 (Reuters) - Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Meta (FB.O) and other large online platforms will have to do more to tackle illegal content or risk hefty fines under new internet rules agreed between European Union countries and EU lawmakers on Saturday.

The agreement came after more than 16 hours of negotiations. The Digital Services Act (DSA) is the second prong of EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager's strategy to rein in Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Meta (FB.O) and other U.S. tech giants.

Last month, she won backing from the 27-country bloc and lawmakers for landmark rules called the Digital Markets Act (DMA) that could force Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft to change their core business practices in Europe. read more

""We have a deal on the DSA: The Digital Services Act will make sure that what is illegal offline is also seen and dealt with as illegal online - not as a slogan, as reality,"" Vestager said in a tweet.

EU lawmaker Dita Charanzova, who had called for such rules eight years ago, welcomed the agreement.

""Google, Meta and other large online platforms will have to act to better protect their users. Europe has made clear that they cannot act as independent digital islands,"" she said in a statement.

In a statement, Google said: ""As the law is finalised and implemented, the details will matter. We look forward to working with policymakers to get the remaining technical details right to ensure the law works for everyone.""

Under the DSA, the companies face fines up to 6% of their global turnover for violating the rules while repeated breaches could see them banned from doing business in the EU.

The new rules ban targeted advertising aimed at children or based on sensitive data such as religion, gender, race and political opinions. Dark patterns, which are tactics that mislead people into giving personal data to companies online, will also be prohibited.

Very large online platforms and online search engines will be required to take specific measures during a crisis. The move was triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the related disinformation.

The companies could be forced to hand over data related to their algorithms to regulators and researchers.

The companies also face a yearly fee up to 0.05% of worldwide annual revenue to cover the costs of monitoring their compliance.

EU lawmaker Martin Schirdewan criticised the exemption granted to medium-sized companies.

""Under pressure from the conservatives, an exception rule for medium-sized companies was integrated, this is a mistake. Due to the large number of companies that fall under this definition in the digital sector, the exception is like a loophole,"" he said.

The DSA will be enforced in 2024.

166,META,2022-06-17,"At avatar fashion store, Meta to sell virtual clothes for real money","













June 17 (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O) is launching a digital clothing store where users can purchase designer outfits for their avatars, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Friday.

Virtual outfits designed by fashion brands Balenciaga, Prada and Thom Browne will be available for purchase to start, said Zuckerberg, speaking in a live video stream with Instagram's head of fashion.

A Meta spokesperson said they would be priced between $2.99 and $8.99, much less than the real outfits by those designers. Prada's Matinee ostrich leather bag, for example, sells for $10,700.

Zuckerberg said he hoped to build the store out into an open marketplace where developers can create and sell a wide array of digital clothes.

Avatars have emerged as one way for Meta to link user identity across Facebook, Instagram and its other services, as it increasingly ties the platforms together and steers toward building an immersive ""metaverse"" of shared, interconnected digital worlds where users can gather.

Users of the company's virtual reality headsets set up avatars to play video games, take exercise classes and participate in conference calls, although initially the digital outfits will be available only on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, Meta said in a statement.

The company redesigned its virtual reality avatars last year to be more expressive and three-dimensional, then made them available on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger starting in January.

167,META,2022-03-29,Facebook owner Meta puts plans to build Dutch data centre on ice,"













AMSTERDAM, March 29 (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta (FB.O) said on Tuesday it was suspending plans to build a giant data centre in the Netherlands, following political opposition.

The move comes a week after the Dutch Senate passed a motion asking Prime Minister Mark Rutte's government to ""use its powers"" to temporarily block construction of the site in the northern town of Zeewolde, 50 km east of Amsterdam. read more

""Given the current circumstances, we have decided to pause our development efforts in Zeewolde,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement.

The town in December had approved plans to build the largest facility of its kind in the Netherlands, from which Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp would serve users across Europe.

It would use 1.38 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity and cover 166 hectares (410 acres) of farmland, and was expected to run on green energy and create 400 permanent jobs.

It was, however, opposed by some environmental campaigners who do not want the limited supply of sustainable power generated in the Netherlands to be used by a multinational company. Some residents of Zeewolde said they felt their voices had not been heard in the permitting process.

The Senate motion asked the government to delay construction until a government policy on data centres had been agreed.

“After having been invited in 2019 by the local, provincial and national government to consider a data center investment in the Netherlands and Zeewolde in particular, Meta envisioned a strong partnership that would bring jobs and community benefits to the region,"" the spokesperson said.

The company left the door open to restarting the project, saying it would continue to cooperate with the municipality over what to do next.

168,META,2022-11-06,"Facebook parent Meta is preparing large-scale layoffs this week, Wall Street Journal reports","













Nov 6 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) is planning to begin large-scale layoffs this week that will affect thousands of employees, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday citing people familiar with the matter, with an announcement planned as early as Wednesday.

Meta declined to comment on the WSJ report.

Facebook parent Meta in October forecasted a weak holiday quarter and significantly more costs next year wiping about $67 billion off Meta's stock market value, adding to the more than half a trillion dollars in value already lost this year.

The disappointing outlook comes as Meta is contending with slowing global economic growth, competition from TikTok, privacy changes from Apple (AAPL.O), concerns about massive spending on the metaverse and the ever-present threat of regulation.

Meta logo is seen in this illustration taken, August 22, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has said he expects the metaverse investments to take about a decade to bear fruit. In the meantime, he has had to freeze hiring, shutter projects and reorganize teams to trim costs.

""In 2023, we're going to focus our investments on a small number of high priority growth areas. So that means some teams will grow meaningfully, but most other teams will stay flat or shrink over the next year. In aggregate, we expect to end 2023 as either roughly the same size, or even a slightly smaller organization than we are today"" Zuckerberg said on the last earnings call in late October.

The social media company had in June cut plans to hire engineers by at least 30%, with Zuckerberg warning employees to brace for an economic downturn.

Meta's shareholder Altimeter Capital Management in an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg had previously said the company needs to streamline by cutting jobs and capital expenditure, adding that Meta has lost investor confidence as it ramped up spending and pivoted to the metaverse.

Several technology companies, including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Twitter Inc and Snap Inc (SNAP.N) have cut jobs and scaled back hiring in recent months as global economic growth slows due to higher interest rates, rising inflation and an energy crisis in Europe.

March 10 (Reuters) - Facebook-parent Meta Platforms (META.O) is planning additional layoffs to be announced in multiple rounds over the next few months, which could match the 13% job cut tally from last year, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday citing people familiar with the matter.

Meta let go of 11,000 employees four months ago and would be the first Big Tech company to announce a second round of mass layoffs.

The first wave of the new cuts would be announced next week and are likely to hit non-engineering roles the hardest, according to the report.

The company is also expected to shut down some projects and teams in conjunction with these cuts, the report added.

Meta did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Nov 9 (Reuters) - U.S. social media giant Meta (META.O) has missed the deadline to launch a fresh appeal against Russia's block of Facebook and Instagram in the country, the RIA Novosti news agency reported on Wednesday, citing a court official.

RIA reported Meta did not file an cassation appeal, meaning the company has now lost the opportunity to launch further judicial challenges, including in Russia's supreme court, against Russia's decision to ban the social media platforms.

No comment was immediately available from Meta.

Russia banned Facebook and Instagram as ""extremist"" in March as Moscow imposed sweeping restrictions on freedom of speech at home following its invasion of Ukraine.

Meta lost an initial appeal in June against it being labelled ""extremist"" in a court system which almost always sides with state prosecutors.

Russia has said there will be no punishments for Russians accessing the platforms, for instance through a virtual private network (VPN), and Meta's WhatsApp messenger service is not affected by the ban.

Oct 20 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) independent oversight board said on Thursday that starting this month it can decide on applying warning screens, marking content as ""disturbing"" or ""sensitive"".

The board, which already has the ability to review user appeals to remove content, said it would be able to make binding decisions to apply a warning screen when ""leaving up or restoring qualifying content"", including to photos and videos.

Separately in its quarterly transparency report, the board said it received 347,000 appeals from Facebook and Instagram users around the world during the second quarter ended June 30.

""Since we started accepting appeals two years ago, we have received nearly two million appeals from users around the world,"" the board report said.

""This demonstrates the ongoing demand from users to appeal Meta’s content moderation decisions to an independent body.""

The oversight board, which includes academics, rights experts and lawyers, was created by the company to rule on a small slice of thorny content moderation appeals, but it can also advise on site policies.

Last month, it objected to Facebook's removal of a newspaper report about the Taliban that it considered positive, backing users' freedom of expression and saying the tech company relied too heavily on automated moderation. read more

Sept 15 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) independent Oversight Board said on Thursday that Facebook should not have taken down a newspaper report about the Taliban that it considered positive, backing users' freedom of expression and saying the tech company relied too heavily on automated moderation.

Meta found the post on the Taliban announcing that schools and colleges in Afghanistan for women and girls would reopen in March violated Facebook's policies because it ""praised"" entities deemed to ""engage in serious offline harms"".

The company limited the newspaper's access to certain Facebook features after taking down the post.

The newspaper appealed the decision after which the post was referred to a special moderation queue, but was never reviewed, according to the Oversight Board.

The Oversight Board said Meta's decision to remove the post was inconsistent with Facebook's policies as they allow reporting on such organizations, and the company reversed its decision after the board selected the case.

""The Board found that Meta should better protect users' freedom of expression when it comes to reporting on terrorist regimes,"" the Oversight Board said. (https://bit.ly/3U8aUnP)

""By using automated systems to remove content, Media Matching Service banks can amplify the impact of incorrect decisions by individual human reviewers,"" it added.

Aug 31 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) is setting up a new group that will focus on creating products and features for its Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp platforms that people will be able to purchase, a company spokesperson said on Wednesday.

""Any new product will be complementary to our existing ads business,"" the spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement.

The move would put Meta on the same course as companies including Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) that have launched paid tiers to unlock additional features.

175,META,2022-06-01,Facebook-owner Meta Platforms' Sheryl Sandberg to leave after 14 years,"













June 1 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, whose close partnership with Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg powered the growth of the world's biggest social network, is leaving the company after 14 years, she said in a Facebook post on Wednesday.

The announcement initially sent the social media firm's shares down 4%, but the stock was nearly flat in after hours trade.

""When I took this job in 2008, I hoped I would be in this role for five years. Fourteen years later, it is time for me to write the next chapter of my life,"" she wrote.

Chief Growth Officer Javier Olivan will take over as chief operating officer, Zuckerberg said in a separate Facebook post, although he added that he did not plan to replace Sandberg's role directly within the company's existing structure.

""I think Meta has reached the point where it makes sense for our product and business groups to be more closely integrated, rather than having all the business and operations functions organized separately from our products,"" he said.

Olivan has worked at Meta for more than 14 years and has led teams handling Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger.

Sandberg's departure marks an end of an era for Meta, which is shifting focus toward hardware products and the ""metaverse"" after years of scandals over privacy abuses and the spread of conspiratorial content on its platforms, as well as plateauing user growth on its flagship app Facebook.

The second-in-command to founder Zuckerberg, who was 23 years old when he hired her, Sandberg is one of the most visible executives at the company and the lead architect of its often-criticized ads-based business model.

Bringing management experience and knowledge of the then-nascent digital ads industry, she transformed Facebook from a buzzy startup into a revenue behemoth, while also positioning herself as the face of feminism in corporate America.

At the time, Facebook was making $272 million in revenue, for a net loss of $56 million, according to regulatory filings. By 2011, a year before the company's initial public offering, its revenue had shot to $3.7 billion on $1 billion in profits.

Meta ended 2021 with revenue of $118 billion and earnings of $39.4 billion.

Sandberg said in her post that she will continue to serve on Meta's board after leaving the company in the fall.

When asked about her next steps, she told Reuters she was focusing on philanthropy at a ""critical moment for women.""

Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook and current chair of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT), gives a news conference on the sidelines during the 2019 United Nations Climate Action Summit at U.N. headquarters in New York City, New York, U.S., September 23, 2019. REUTERS/Yana Paskova/Files

""We've hired so many great leaders. I feel really good about that. The next leadership team is in place to take the company forward,"" she said, mentioning Chief Business Officer Marne Levine and President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg by name.

STAUNCH DEFENDER

Sandberg has been a staunch defender of Facebook over the course of its many controversies, consistently arguing that executives were learning from their mistakes and honing the company's tools to better police against harmful content.

She told Reuters last year that she and Zuckerberg had a responsibility to fix systems that had failed, while rejecting reports that she was losing power at the company.

""People love headlines about corporate drama, and I think it's fair to say they particularly love headlines about sidelining women,"" she said in the January 2021 interview.

Sandberg's tenure covered both Facebook's original settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in 2011 for privacy violations and a subsequent blockbuster $5 billion settlement for violations of the earlier deal.

She and Zuckerberg were among those that then-Commissioner Rohit Chopra said should have faced more investigation for their roles in the company's behavior.

Under her leadership, the company was buffeted by revelations in 2018 that U.K. consultancy Cambridge Analytica had improperly acquired data on millions of its U.S. users to target election advertising.

The same year, U.N. human rights investigators said the use of Facebook had played a key role in spreading hate speech that fueled violence against the Rohingya community in Myanmar.

She courted additional criticism when she told Reuters early last year she believed events around the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol were largely organized on other platforms, although researchers had identified similar activity on Facebook as well.

Whistleblower Frances Haugen late last year accused the social media giant of repeatedly prioritizing profit over clamping down on hate speech and misinformation, and said her lawyers had filed at least eight complaints with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Prior to joining Facebook, Sandberg was vice president of Global Online Sales and Operations at Google and chief of staff for the United States Treasury Department under former President Bill Clinton.

A Harvard University graduate, Sandberg is the author of several books, including the 2013 feminist manifesto ""Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead.""

176,META,2022-06-02,Sandberg's exit may not be a big blow for Facebook-parent Meta,"













June 2 (Reuters) - Sheryl Sandberg's exit from Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) comes at a crucial time for the Facebook parent as it pivots to ""metaverse"" in the face of slowing ad revenue, although Wall Street analysts say her departure will not be as significant.

As second-in-command to founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, Sandberg transformed Facebook from a buzzy startup into a technology behemoth and helped grow its ad revenue to over $100 billion from $272 million in her 14 years with the company.

She was also the face of the company in dealing with regulators in Washington as the social-media network became embroiled in a series of controversies, including a data scandal that involved British firm Cambridge Analytica.

""Meta is a more mature business with set processes as Sandberg moves on,"" JMP Securities analyst Andrew Boone said.

""While we acknowledge Sandberg's instrumental role in building Meta's advertising business, the company now has the infrastructure and processes in place to weather most departures, including Sandberg's.""

A Harvard graduate, Sandberg joined Facebook from Google in 2008, after having served as chief of staff for the U.S. Treasury Department under former President Bill Clinton.

Javier Olivan, currently chief growth officer, will take over as the company's COO when Sandberg leaves.

""I'm more concerned about the ultimate outcome of the metaverse and the impact of earnings over the next handful of years than I would be about who is sitting in the role of COO,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC in New York.

MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni said former British deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who was hired in 2018 to run the company's global policy organization, could play a larger role in dealing with regulators.

177,META,2022-07-27,"YouTube's quarter shows problems Meta may face: TikTok, weakening economy","













July 27 (Reuters) - Mostly reassuring financial results from Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) included one concerning sign for social media companies: Its YouTube service posted its second difficult quarter in a row.

Quarterly ad sales at the world's biggest video sharing service grew at the slowest pace since Alphabet began disclosing that data three years ago. This indicates that last week's disastrous earnings report by Snap Inc (SNAP.N) reflected problems not unique to Snap - and it could also spell trouble for Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), whose results are due later on Wednesday.

Competition from TikTok, a strong performance a year ago and a shaky economy all played a role in YouTube's latest woes, which earlier in the year were fueled by effects from the war in Ukraine and software changes by Apple Inc (AAPL.O) to mobile devices due to privacy concerns.

Which factor is contributing most and how long the deceleration extends could significantly affect Alphabet shares, even though investors have been enamored with YouTube's potential to bring in hundreds of billions of dollars annually.

YouTube's advertising revenue grew by 4.8% in the second quarter, a percentage point lower than its growth during the dismal first few months of the pandemic. This suggests that YouTube ad sales are more vulnerable to bad economic conditions than are the ad sales of Alphabet's biggest business, Google search.

YouTube ad sales rose to $7.3 billion, below estimates of $7.5 billion, according to FactSet data. Alphabet's core business is search ad sales, which grew 13.5% to $40.7 billion in the second quarter. YouTube competes more closely for ad dollars with media and social media companies such as Snap, Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Meta's Facebook and Instagram.

COMPETITION

Google Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler acknowledged on Tuesday that ""pullbacks in spend by some advertisers"" due to macroeconomic uncertainty are hurting YouTube. He also said last year's strong performance was difficult to beat, since advertisers that had pared spending due to the pandemic roared back with big budgets.

""Alphabet's results appear to confirm our checks that search trends were relatively stable during [the second quarter], while YouTube is more exposed to wobbles in the ad spending cycle,"" analysts at Robert W. Baird & Co Inc wrote.

Ad industry analysts pointed to yet another unfavorable situation for YouTube: Competition from TikTok, whose feed of short videos has stolen the attention of some users and advertisers away from YouTube and is also a threat to Meta.

""TikTok is hurting YouTube by stealing top creators and cannibalizing consumer viewing times,"" Needham analyst Laura Martin wrote in a note, adding that the results show broader ad weakness and could also be bad for Meta.

Schindler told analysts he remained encouraged by ""the early stages of testing monetization with ads"" on Shorts, YouTube's feature to combat TikTok.

YouTube itself still sees opportunity drawing cash advertisers currently spend to market on TV, he said.

MoffettNathanson analysts raised their estimate for YouTube sales growth in 2022 to 4.7% from a 1.5% decline as the second- quarter results were not as bad as they had feared. YouTube, whose sales have been broken out in Alphabet results since the end of 2018, typically generates more ad revenue in the second half of the year.

Jan 1 (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta Inc (META.O) is preparing to announce whether it will allow former U.S. President Donald Trump back on to Facebook and Instagram, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.

The social media giant had previously said it will decide by Jan 7 whether to allow the former president to return. However, that decision is now expected to be announced later in the month, the newspaper said, citing a person familiar with the matter.

Meta has set up a working group to focus on the matter, according to people with knowledge of its operations, the report said, adding that the group includes staffers from the public policy and communications teams, as well as from the content policy team.

Meta did not immediately respond to a request by Reuters for comment.

The development comes after Elon Musk, Twitter's new owner, revoked a permanent ban on Trump in November last year on the social media platform after polling users.

Trump maintained that he had no interest in returning to Twitter.

""I don't see any reason for it,"" the former president had said via video when asked whether he planned to return to Twitter by a panel at the Republican Jewish Coalition's annual leadership meeting.

Trump has mounted relentless attacks on the integrity of U.S. voting since his 2020 election defeat and launched a bid in November to regain the presidency in 2024, aiming to pre-empt potential Republican rivals.

179,META,2023-01-19,Trump says his campaign talking with Meta about possible return to Facebook -Fox News,"













Jan 18 (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Donald Trump told Fox News Digital on Wednesday that his campaign was in talks with Meta Platforms (META.O) about a possible return to Facebook and Instagram, two years after the company banned him for inciting violence.

""We are talking to them, and we'll see how it all works out,"" Trump said, according to the report.

""If they took us back, it would help them greatly, and that's okay with me,"" he said. ""But they need us more than we need them.""

Meta declined to comment to Reuters.

Trump launched his bid to regain the presidency in 2024 in November.

Meta, the world's biggest social media company, is set to make a controversial decision on the future of Trump's accounts this month.

While Trump has shunned Twitter since its decision in November to restore his account, saying he preferred his own Truth Social platform, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital on Wednesday that being back on Facebook ""will be an important tool for the 2024 campaign to reach voters.""

Meta revoked Trump's access to Facebook and Instagram after removing two of his posts during the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, including a video containing false claims of widespread voter fraud during the 2020 presidential election.

The company's independent oversight board ruled later in 2021 that the suspension was justified but objected to its indeterminate nature. In response, Meta committed to reviewing the suspension two years after it began.

""If we determine that there is still a serious risk to public safety, we will extend the restriction for a set period of time and continue to re-evaluate until that risk has receded,"" Meta VP of Global Affairs Nick Clegg wrote at the time.

181,META,2022-09-07,"In casino app cases against Apple, Google and Meta, judge queries 9th Circ. on immunity issue","













(Reuters) - It is a rare and wondrous thing for a federal judge to admit that he could use some help interpreting complicated precedent.

So cheers are in order for U.S. District Judge Edward Davila of San Jose, California, who is presiding over three big class actions in which consumers allege that Apple Inc, Google LLC and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc promote illegal online gambling through so-called social casino apps.

In a consolidated Sept. 2 decision addressing all three cases, Davila rejected two of the plaintiffs’ theories of liability against the online platforms, holding that Google, Apple and Facebook are immune under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act from claims that they offered access to the casino apps and provided the app developers with data and other services to help them target big spenders and retain users.

Davila refused to dismiss plaintiffs’ third claim, ruling that Section 230 does not shield the websites from liability for processing (and taking a cut) of consumers’ payments for the virtual “chips” required by the casino apps.

But Davila said he might be wrong about the scope of Section 230 immunity – and that it makes sense to find out sooner rather than later what the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals thinks of his decision. The judge invoked a provision of the U.S. Code that allows trial courts, on their own, to certify certain rulings for interlocutory appeals.

“This case involves controlling questions of law, namely whether the platforms are entitled to immunity for their hosting of the allegedly unlawful social casino apps,” Davila wrote. “While the court believes it has followed the 9th Circuit's precedent on this complicated question, the court finds that reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome.”

In such circumstances, the judge said, an immediate appeal will ensure that no one wastes time and money litigating cases whose parameters could change drastically if Davila misinterpreted 9th Circuit precedent.

The parties must still petition the 9th Circuit to grant review of Davila’s decision, but the judge’s certification substantially increases the odds that the appeals court will hear the case before the litigation goes any farther. After all, as Davila pointed out, if the 9th Circuit disagrees with his holding that the Apple, Google and Meta can be held liable for processing payments for gambling chips, the litigation is over. (The judge stayed the underlying cases until the 9th Circuit decides whether to take up the appeal.)

Lead plaintiffs lawyer Rafey Balabanian of Edelson said the judge was right to tee up the case for the 9th Circuit. “The court's choice to make the decision immediately appealable is a welcome one,” Balabanian said in an email statement. “This case puts at issue tens of billions of dollars lost by ordinary hard-working Americans, and Section 230 is one of the platforms' primary defenses. We believe that an affirmance by the 9th Circuit will provide a clear roadmap for the remainder of these cases."" (Edelson has previously won hundreds of millions in settlements from social casino apps the firm accused of facilitating illegal online gambling.)

I also reached out to Apple counsel from DLA Piper, Google lawyers from Baker & McKenzie and Facebook counsel from Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. Apple and Google lawyers did not respond. Christopher Chorba from Gibson Dunn referred me to Facebook, which didn’t provide comment on Davila’s ruling or his certification of the decision for immediate appeal.

The judge’s decision methodically analyzed the 9th Circuit’s key precedent on the scope of Section 230 immunity. The critical question, according to Davila's reading of such cases as 2016’s Doe v. Internet Brands Inc and 2021’s Gonzalez v. Google LLC is whether plaintiffs are attempting to blame platforms for their own alleged misconduct or for alleged misconduct by third parties whose content appears on the platforms.

In the Doe case, for instance, the 9th Circuit ruled that Section 230 did not shield a website from an aspiring model’s allegations that it negligently failed to warn her and other users that two rapists were using the site to lure women to fake auditions. And in the Gonzalez decision, the appeals court held that Google was not liable to terrorism victims for airing ISIS videos on YouTube – but that Section 230 did not immunize the company from claims that it assisted ISIS by sharing advertising revenue with the group.

“Liability turns on the degree of control that a website exercises over the offensive content,” Davila concluded. “Section 230 is not limitless. While its origin demonstrates a preference for immunity, it is not meant to immunize a website's own bad acts.”

Applying that standard to the allegations in casino app cases, Davila said it was easy to dismiss claims that Google, Apple and Facebook were liable for offering access to – and even promoting — social casino apps. The judge said it was tougher to decide whether Section 230 precludes claims that the platforms helped the gambling apps attain and attract users by offering design and advertising advice and data analytics. Davila decided that although Google, Apple and Facebook benefited financially from the casino apps' popularity, their support was akin to publishing advice and therefore shielded by Section 230.

But plaintiffs’ allegation that Google, Apple and Facebook enabled the sale of virtual chips to be used for online gambling, Davila said, is “grounded in the platforms' own bad acts, not in the content of the social casino apps that the platforms display on their websites.” The judge said that in his analysis, Section 230 does not immunize online platforms for their own participation in allegedly illegal transactions.

If I were a betting woman — which I am not — I’d guess that the 9th Circuit will agree to review Davila’s decision, given the magnitude of consumers’ alleged losses and the novelty of their surviving theory.

Even if the appeals court disagrees with Davila's conclusions, the judge is a winner in my book.

LONDON, July 18 (Reuters) - Britain's competition regulator said on Monday it would carry out another review of Facebook owner Meta's (META.O) acquisition of Giphy after a tribunal quashed its original decision to block it.

Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) last year ordered Meta to sell animated images platform Giphy, which it acquired for a reported $400 million, because of its concerns about a loss of a possible competitor in advertising, and the potential impact on social media rivals.

Last month, the U.S. tech giant partially won an appeal against the regulator, when Britain's Competition Appeals Tribunal (CAT) said that the CMA had ""failed properly to consult"" and had ""wrongly excised portions from its decision"". read more

The CAT said it had quashed the regulator's ruling and referred the matter back for a new decision.

In response, the CMA said the tribunal had endorsed its approach to reviewing mergers that might harm innovation, but had agreed to reconsider its ruling.

""We will commence our review shortly,"" it said.

183,META,2022-10-27,"Morning Bid: Meta averse, ECB decides and CS slides","













A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.

Meta added a deep pothole to an already bumpy U.S. earnings season - another obstacle to a market pumped-up by bets of some central bank relief on the horizon as G7 economies slow.

The Facebook parent's shares (META.O) plunged almost 20% after the bell on Wednesday after the firm forecast a weak holiday quarter and higher costs next year, while investors grew skeptical of its pricey metaverse bets. read more

With Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon reporting later on Thursday, sentiment toward tech giants remains on edge. Beyond the interest rate cheer at the banks and energy crunch windfalls for Big Oil, other real sector readouts weren't much better than the tech world and Boeing (BA.N) stock fell almost 10% on Wednesday after its profit miss too. read more

But the big digital damage has cut across this month's powerful market rally, an updraft based largely on the slightly vague hopes that the U.S. Federal Reserve may next week signal yet another jumbo 75 basis point interest rate rise could be the last of such magnitude in this cycle.

The Bank of Canada certainly added fuel to that fire on Wednesday with a smaller-than-expected half-point rate hike and said it was getting closer to the end of its historic tightening campaign as the economy is set to stall next year.

The European Central Bank is the latest of the G7 to decide on policy on Thursday, with markets assuming its lagged tightening cycle will - unlike the Canadians - see it deliver the expected 75 bps and detail some further adjustments and rowback to more extraordinary easing measures.

The euro stalled and euro government bond yields edged higher in advance.

The vigil partly also reversed this week's eye-catching recoil in U.S. Treasury yields (.MIWD00000PUS) and the U.S. dollar - both of which perked up ahead of the ECB decision and the release of third-quarter U.S. gross domestic product data. U.S. GDP is expected to show a hefty 2.4% growth rebound following first half contractions.

But after two-week, trough-to-peak bounce of almost 10%, global stock indices (.MIWD00000PUS) struggled to make much headway for the second session on Thursday. Asia bourses were mixed, Europe in the red and U.S. futures up marginally.

The mood wasn't helped much by Switzerland's ailing Credit Suisse (CSGN.S). CS shares plunged 15% after it revealed a long-awaited restructuring plan that raises 4 billion Swiss francs in stock sales, slashes thousands of jobs and spins off its investment bank to stanch a string of heavy losses.

Better news emerged in dealmaking, with Twitter shares (TWTR.N) up 1% after reports banks have started to send $13 billion in cash backing Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter in a sign that the deal is on track to close by the end of the week.

Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Thursday:

* European Central Bank policy decision and press briefing; Bank of Japan begins two day policy meeting

* U.S. Q3 GDP, Sept durable goods orders, Kansas City Fed Oct manufacturing index

* U.S. Treasury auctions 7-year notes

July 27 (Reuters) - Shares of several major U.S. companies tumbled in extended trade on Wednesday following poor quarterly results and forecasts that underscored fears about a potential recession.

Meta Platforms (META.O) fell over 3% after the Facebook owner posted its first-ever quarterly drop in revenue and issued a gloomy forecast, echoing a warning last week from ad tech rival Snap (SNAP.N). read more

ServiceNow (NOW.N) slumped 6% after the business software seller cut its forecast for subscription revenues, blaming a stronger dollar. Cloud software heavyweight Salesforce (CRM.N) lost over 2% after ServiceNow's report.

Wednesday's slew of late-day quarterly reports came after the Nasdaq (.IXIC) rose 4% to post its biggest daily percentage gain since April 2020.

Most of the Nasdaq's gains came after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 75 basis points, as expected. Some investors viewed comments by Fed Chair Jerome Powell as signaling the Fed's fight to tame decades high inflation could be done by year-end. read more

Teladoc Health (TDOC.N), the fifth largest holding in star investor Cathie Wood's Ark Innovation ETF , collapsed by 20% after the virtual healthcare company reported a quarterly loss of $3.1 billion, with almost all of that from writing down the value of its goodwill. That compared to a loss of $133 million in the year-ago period.

Summary Companies Meta soars on cost controls, $40 bln share buyback

Merck slides on disappointing forecast, UnitedHealth drops

S&P 500, Nasdaq hit roughly 5-month highs

Indexes: Dow down 0.11%, S&P up 1.47%, Nasdaq up 3.25%















Feb 2 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq and S&P 500 ended higher on Thursday and touched roughly five-month highs as a more dovish-than-expected message from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell boosted equities and Meta Platforms shares soared on rigorous cost controls.

The Dow slipped, dragged down by declines in some big healthcare stocks.

Investors were still digesting the Fed's policy decision on Wednesday and comments from Powell, who acknowledged progress in the fight against inflation and appeared reluctant to push back against the rally in stocks and bonds.

“I think the reaction to yesterday’s Fed comments really encouraged investors to go risk on,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. ""The bottom line for investors I think is that the Fed’s comments were unexpected.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 39.02 points, or 0.11%, to 34,053.94, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 60.55 points, or 1.47%, to 4,179.76 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 384.50 points, or 3.25%, to 12,200.82.

Shares of megacap stocks Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) also gained strongly ahead of results due after market close on Thursday, with Apple rising 3.7%, and Amazon and Alphabet both up over 7%.

In initial after-hours trading, however, shares of all three companies fell after their respective results.

After a bruising 2022, U.S. stock markets have made a strong start to the year, with tech and other stocks that lagged last year leading the rebound amid hopes that the Fed will temper its aggressive rate hikes, which in turn could alleviate some pressure on equity valuations.

Those trends continued on Thursday. The communications services sector (.SPLRCL) jumped 6.7%, its biggest daily gain in almost three years, led by a 23.3% surge for Facebook parent Meta (META.O). The company revealed stricter cost controls this year and a $40 billion share buyback, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg called 2023 the ""year of efficiency.""

The S&P 500's 50-day moving average moved above the 200-day moving average, a pattern known as a ""golden cross"" that is perceived by many as a bullish technical signal for near-term momentum.

The energy sector (.SPNY), one of last year's standout performers, fell 2.5%, while healthcare (.SPXHC) dropped 0.7%.

UnitedHealth Group (UNH.N) shares fell 5.3% after the U.S. government proposed Medicare Advantage reimbursement rates below analyst estimates, and the stock weighed down the Dow. A 3.3% decline in Merck (MRK.N) shares, after the drugmaker forecast 2023 earnings below Wall Street estimates, also dragged on the blue chip index.

Shares of drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY.N) dropped 3.5% after sales of its closely watched diabetes drug missed estimates.

Data showed jobless claims fell last week to a nine-month low, highlighting the labor market's resilience, ahead of monthly U.S. employment numbers on Friday.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.55-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 36 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 162 new highs and 16 new lows.

About 15 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 11.7 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 18 (Reuters) - The author who first envisioned the metaverse 30 years ago sat down on Wednesday with a top executive from the company investing billions in building it and agreed there were formidable hurdles to bringing it to the masses.

Neal Stephenson, who coined the term in his 1992 novel ""Snowcrash"", and Chris Cox, the chief product officer at Meta, laid out an array of engineering breakthroughs needed to allow millions of people to move seamlessly through immersive virtual worlds displayed on head-mounted devices.

""We're in the very early version, the Xerox PARC era,"" said Cox at a World Economic Forum panel, referring to the company that developed the mouse and other fundamental computer technologies 50 years ago.

""We've got a ways to go,"" said Stephenson, who as well as writing science fiction has worked for technology companies including rocket maker Blue Origin. ""It's really just in the last couple of years that everything has come together.""

Cox, whose company is spending billions of dollars developing software and hardware for the metaverse, said one of the biggest problems is the trade-off between speed and graphics quality.

Virtual environments such as a comedy club, for example, need to support large numbers of user avatars to engagingly simulate the real-world atmospherics of chatter and laughter. But updating those avatars in synchronicity with the movements of their operators limits the processing power available for high-quality graphics.

""We're trying to figure out if comedy can work,"" he said.

A DECADE TO PAY OFF

Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has said he expected his metaverse investments to take around a decade to pay off. By that time, Cox says people will be able to take a walk with friends and family in virtual worlds as readily as they now make video or voice calls.

Meta racked up losses of $9.44 billion at its Reality Labs metaverse unit from January to September last year and is expected to see that number grow significantly in 2023.

That has hammered its shares and contributed to its decision to cut 11,000 jobs.

The ability to move fluidly between experiences in different virtual worlds while retaining clothes and other items associated with an avatar is an issue Stephenson is trying to address through a company he has founded to develop blockchain applications. He said a key question was whether the metaverse was going to be a decentralized technology built from the bottom up or one created top-down by a single company.

""A more open metaverse is better,"" HP Chief Executive Enrique Lores said on the panel. ""If someone controls the full metaverse the ability for others to add value is much smaller.""

189,META,2022-12-05,Facebook owner Meta may remove news from platform if U.S. Congress passes media bill,"













WASHINGTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) on Monday threatened to remove news from its platform if the U.S. Congress passes a proposal aimed at making it easier for news organizations to negotiate collectively with companies like Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Facebook.

Sources briefed on the matter said lawmakers are considering adding the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act to a must-pass annual defense bill as way to help the struggling local news industry.

Meta spokesperson Andy Stone in a tweet said the company would be forced to consider removing news if the law was passed ""rather than submit to government-mandated negotiations that unfairly disregard any value we provide to news outlets through increased traffic and subscriptions.""

loading

He added the proposal fails to recognize that publishers and broadcasters put content on the platform because ""it benefits their bottom line - not the other way around.""

The News Media Alliance, a trade group representing newspaper publishers, is urging Congress to add the bill to the defense bill, arguing that ""local papers cannot afford to endure several more years of Big Tech’s use and abuse, and time to take action is dwindling. If Congress does not act soon, we risk allowing social media to become America’s de facto local newspaper.""

More than two dozen groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, Public Knowledge and the Computer & Communications Industry Association on Monday urged Congress not to approve the local news bill saying it would ""create an ill-advised antitrust exemption for publishers and broadcasters"" and argued the bill does not require ""funds gained through negotiation or arbitration will even be paid to journalists.""

A similar Australian law, which took effect in March 2021 after talks with the big tech firms led to a brief shutdown of Facebook news feeds in the country, has largely worked, a government report said.

Since the News Media Bargaining Code took effect, various tech firms including Meta and Alphabet have signed more than 30 deals with media outlets, compensating them for content that generated clicks and advertising dollars, the report added.

March 10 (Reuters) - Facebook-parent Meta Platforms (META.O) is planning additional layoffs to be announced in multiple rounds over the next few months, which could match the 13% job cut tally from last year, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday citing people familiar with the matter.

Meta let go of 11,000 employees four months ago and would be the first Big Tech company to announce a second round of mass layoffs.

The first wave of the new cuts would be announced next week and are likely to hit non-engineering roles the hardest, according to the report.

The company is also expected to shut down some projects and teams in conjunction with these cuts, the report added.

Meta did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

April 28 (Reuters) - Shares of Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) rose 17% in a relief rally on Thursday after having lost nearly half their value this year, as the social media giant surprised Wall Street with a better-than-expected rise in users joining the platform.

Analysts appeared mixed in their views on the results. At least five brokerages cut their price targets on the stock, while three raised their expectations.

Of the 63 analysts covering the stock, 46 have a ""buy"" or higher rating and only two analysts rate the stock ""sell"" or lower. The median price target on the stock is $300, well above its current trading price of $200.

Facebook's daily active users (DAU), a key metric for advertisers, came in at 1.96 billion, slightly higher than the estimate of 1.95 billion.

While that was enough to send the shares soaring, Wall Street analysts took a more cautious tone, citing worries ranging from the war in Ukraine, Apple's App Store policy changes to competition from ByteDance's TikTok.

""We do not believe the overall FB business has changed much over the past 90 days, but headwinds related to iOS changes, TikTok competition & Reels monetization are better understood,"" J.P Morgan's lead analyst Doug Anmuth said in a note.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic















JAKARTA, July 19 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp have signed up to Indonesia's new licensing rules for tech firms, government records showed on Tuesday, a day ahead of a deadline to comply or risk being blocked.

The registration is required under rules released in late 2020 that would give authorities broad powers to compel platforms to disclose data of certain users and take down content deemed unlawful, or that ""disturbs public order"" within four hours if urgent, and 24 hours if not. read more

Communication ministry records on foreign providers showed Meta's units had signed up on Tuesday, but Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) was not among those that had registered.

Of Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) units, which include YouTube and Google, only Google's cloud services had registered as of Tuesday, according to Semuel Abrijani Pangerapan, a senior ministry official.

Google, Twitter and Facebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

With a young, tech-savvy population of 270 million, Indonesia is a top-10 market in terms of user numbers for a host of social media companies, including Twitter, Facebook and Bytedance's TikTok.

TikTok had already registered, as had streaming services Netflix (NFLX.O), Spotify (SPOT.N), the records showed.

Semuel said non-compliant firms would lose out in the long run and would be reprimanded, fined, then eventually blocked in Indonesia.

However, he added that platforms would get an opportunity to reverse that, should they subsequently decide to register.

""If they don't sign up, it's their loss. That means they don't see Indonesia as their market potential,"" he told a media briefing.

July 26 (Reuters) - Meta's (META.O) future may lie in the metaverse, but when the company reports results on Wednesday, investors will be focused on two more immediate bets: pumping up short-video offering Reels to compete with TikTok and rebuilding its ads system after Apple (AAPL.O) throttled access to user data.

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg believes that will take time, and that the company needs to speed up the process, he told staffers on a call late last month. The discussion hit on key issues that will be watched in Meta's quarterly results release on Wednesday. read more

Meta is expected to record its first-ever revenue drop in its history as a public company, down 0.4% to about $29 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Investors are also bracing for flat user growth and a third consecutive quarter of profit declines and are watching for signs of hardware project cuts and slower hiring to manage costs. read more

The social media giant this year has unveiled sweeping redesigns of Facebook and Instagram, imitating rival TikTok's look and algorithmically driven recommendations of viral short videos.

Meta is also investing heavily to rebuild its ads system around its own user data, after privacy changes introduced last year by Apple degraded Meta's ad targeting capabilities.

Zuckerberg told employees on the call, which took place on June 30, that Reels represented a ""huge opportunity"" for Meta, but also noted that the format was ""still only around 15% of the size of TikTok.""

""I think realistically we're looking at a year and a half, maybe even longer, before we'll really have a line of sight to having a strong leadership position,"" he said.

The timeline for rebuilding the ads system was similar, he said. He repeatedly urged staff to increase their ""intensity"" to get through the period.

While Meta has the strongest first-party user data in the industry, it also ""has a lot of credibility to restore before investors can get comfortable with maintaining its leadership position in digital advertising's secular growth,"" analysts from RBC Capital Markets wrote.

Zuckerberg told employees that the economy had worsened since executives first planned the Reels and ad changes, and outlined plans to expedite the transitions so profits from the core business could fund Meta's long-term metaverse bets.

""Our job is basically to bring in as much of the business that might be three years out into two years out, or one and a half years out, while also pushing on things like expenses and cost growth,"" he said.

If needed, he added, his inclination was to ""take more pain in terms of a little bit less profitability"" in the short term, rather than cutting back on ""funding for future stuff.""

The changes have created some backlash, though.

Instagram, which has been testing TikTok-like features, last week postponed plans to replace the app's scrolling feed with a more immersive ""panavision""-style layout that fills the entire screen, from October to early next year.

A Meta spokesperson said the company recognizes ""that changes to the app can be an adjustment, and we want to take the time to make sure we get this right.""

On Monday, two of Instagram's biggest users, Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner, both shared a meme imploring the company to ""Make Instagram Instagram again.""

""Stop trying to be TikTok I just want to see cute photos of my friends,"" the post said. It signed off: ""Sincerely, everyone.""

Instagram head Adam Mosseri acknowledged the criticism in a video on Tuesday, saying the layout was ""not yet good"" and the company would have to ""get it to a good place if we're going to ship it"" to all Instagram users.

The company would continue doing tests and shifting toward video however, he added.

REUTERS/Yves Herman















BRUSSELS, May 11 (Reuters) - Google (GOOGL.O), Meta (FB.O) and other online service providers will be required to find and remove online child pornography under proposed European Commission rules, a move some privacy groups say could put people's communications at risk.

Companies that fail to comply with the rules face fines up to 6% of their annual income or global turnover, which will be set by EU countries.

The EU executive said its proposal announced on Wednesday aimed to replace the current system of voluntary detection and reporting by companies which has proven to be insufficient to protect children.

It cited the more than one million reports of child sexual abuse in the 27-country bloc in 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic a factor in the 64% rise in such reports in 2021 compared to the previous year. On top of that, 60% of child sexual abuse material worldwide is hosted on EU servers.

""The proposed rules introduce an obligation for relevant online service providers to assess the risk of their services' misuse for the dissemination of child sexual abuse materials or for the solicitation of children (grooming),"" the Commission said in a statement.

The companies will then have to report and remove known and new images and videos, as well as cases of grooming. An EU Centre on Child Sexual Abuse will be set up to act as a hub of expertise and to forward reports to the police.

The rules will apply to hosting services and interpersonal communication services such as messaging services, app stores and internet access providers.

The Commission's proposal could endanger end-to-end encryption and open the door to authoritarian surveillance tactics, lobbying group European Digital Rights said.

Meta subsidiary WhatsApp echoed the same concerns.

""Incredibly disappointing to see a proposed EU regulation on the internet fail to protect end-to-end encryption,"" Will Cathcart, WhatsApp head, said in a tweet.

""It’s important that any measures adopted do not undermine end-to-end encryption which protects the safety and privacy of billions of people, including children,"" a Meta spokesperson said.

The draft EU rules need to be thrashed out with EU countries and EU lawmakers before they can become law.

WASHINGTON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Senators Mark Warner and Marco Rubio, chair and vice chair of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, wrote to Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META.O) on Monday about documents that show it knew developers in China and Russia had access to user data that could be used for espionage.

""It appears from these documents that Facebook has known, since at least September 2018, that hundreds of thousands of developers in countries Facebook characterized as 'high-risk,' including the People’s Republic of China, had access to significant amounts of sensitive user data,"" Warner, a Democrat, and Republican Rubio wrote in the letter to company founder Mark Zuckerberg.

The letter said an internal Meta document showed that nearly 90,000 developers in China had been given access to information about users, including profile data, photos and private messages even though Facebook had never been able to operate in China.

More than 42,000 developers in Russia and thousands in Iran and North Korea also had access to the information, they wrote.

The unsealed documents came to light as part of litigation in the Northern District of California that was filed in 2018.

""We have grave concerns about the extent to which this access could have enabled foreign intelligence service activity, ranging from foreign malign influence to targeting and counter-intelligence,"" the two senators wrote.

Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/















July 14 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) said on Thursday its flagship social network Facebook is introducing ways for users to maintain up to five profiles, a major shift from the ""real name"" requirement the company has maintained since its inception.

The product change would ""help people tailor their experience based on interests and relationships,"" like posting different types of content aimed at family versus friends, Meta said in a statement.

The company will continue to require that each user have only one Facebook account, with a main profile that continues to use the person's real name. People will be able to access any additional profiles they create after logging in to that account.

The change grants users formal leeway to semi-anonymize their identity on the world's biggest social network, in keeping with options offered by competitors like TikTok and Twitter, as well as Meta's own photo and video app Instagram.

In its statement, Meta said its rules against impersonation and other types of misleading representations of identity would continue to apply to all profiles.

A Meta spokesperson said the company was testing the new approach in certain countries, but declined to specify which ones.

Summary Law firms

Law firms Related documents Firm said California data law permits recovery of fees in case

Defendant BrandTotal will oppose fee petition















(Reuters) - Lawyers for Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc have asked a California federal judge to award more than $2.73 million in legal fees for their work on a lawsuit accusing an Israeli company of unlawfully scraping user and advertising information from the popular social media site.

Meta's legal team at U.S. law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr argued in a San Francisco court filing Wednesday that the fees they seek under a California state computer data and fraud law are justified.

Meta sued advertising analytics company BrandTotal Ltd in 2020 and won a court ruling in May that Meta said in court filings had ""shut down [BrandTotal's] entire scraping operation.""

Wilmer attorneys including partner Sonal Mehta, a lead tech and intellectual property lawyer at the firm, said Meta negotiated fixed fees for parts of the legal work and that the overall amount sought ""reflects a discount from WilmerHale’s standard billing rates.""

A representative from Meta on Thursday declined to comment, and a spokesperson for BrandTotal did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

A lawyer for BrandTotal, Rudy Telscher of Husch Blackwell in St. Louis, told Reuters his client will oppose Meta's fee bid.

Telscher said ""we do not believe the conduct was of a nature warranting fees and certainly not at the level that Facebook seeks.""

BrandTotal will ask the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to take up the underlying legal issues, he said. The case raises issues over whether ""social media companies, like Facebook, can contractually prevent users from selling data they own under the California Consumer Protection Act to companies like BrandTotal,"" Telscher said.

Meta's complaint alleged BrandTotal's automated data harvesting using browser extensions and mobile applications violated the California Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act, the state's Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and Facebook's terms of service.

Wilmer said it spent more than 4,200 hours on the litigation. Mehta, the highest biller shown in the petition for fees, charged $1,200 an hour.

It said its fee arrangement included fixed-fee amounts of $480,000 for ""ongoing case strategy and communications""; $750,000 for ""offensive expert discovery""; and $325,000 for Meta's motion for summary judgment.

The case is Meta Platforms Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, Case No. 3:20-CV-07182-JCS.

203,META,2022-07-25,Two new lawsuits claim Meta's Instagram caused eating disorders,"Summary New lawsuits join growing number of claims that platform harmed teen mental health

Families say the app fueled anorexia, depression, anxiety















(Reuters) - Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc was hit with two new lawsuits Monday accusing it of fueling eating disorders and other mental health problems in teenage users of its Instagram photo sharing service, the latest in a string of lawsuits linking social media to mental health problems in children.

Two families, both represented by Laura Marquez-Garrett of the Social Media Victims Law Center, filed their lawsuits in federal court in San Francisco. The lawsuits alleged that Instagram caused the girls to become addicted to the service and to develop depression, anxiety and anorexia.

Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Instagram allows users to post pictures, and uses an automated algorithm to show them other users' pictures. Both of Monday's lawsuits said the algorithm encouraged eating disorders by showing the teens pictures of very thin models and content related to extreme exercise.

Both girls attempted suicide and were hospitalized multiple times, according to the lawsuits. One of them had to have a feeding tube at times because she would not eat.

They said Meta knew that some people became addicted to the service, and that teenagers were especially vulnerable. They also said that the company failed to verify users' ages, allowing both plaintiffs to join when they were only 12 despite a nominal minimum age of 13, and failed to shield minors from sexual messages.

Both lawsuits also alleged that the algorithm recommended ""'friends' who were, in fact, adult Instagram users either suffering from these mental health issues themselves or using the Instagram product to find and exploit young girls.""

At least nine other lawsuits have been filed against Meta alleging harm to minors' mental health, including one accusing the company of contributing to an 11-year-old girl's suicide. So far, all are in their early stages.

In February, U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, and Cynthia Lummis, a Republican, introduced a bill aimed at addressing social media addiction. The bill calls for the National Science Foundation and National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine to study potential measures social media companies could take to discourage addiction, and empower the Federal Trade Commission to pass rules requiring them.

The cases are CN v. Meta Platforms Inc and Martin v. Meta Platforms Inc, Nos. 3:22-cv-04283 and 3:22-cv-04286, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

Companies Meta Platforms Inc Follow















WASHINGTON, July 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission sought a court order on Wednesday to block Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META.O) from buying virtual reality (VR) content maker Within Unlimited.

The FTC, in a request filed on Wednesday in federal court in San Francisco for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, called Facebook a ""global technology behemoth,"" noting its ownership of popular apps including Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, and said its ""campaign to conquer VR"" began in 2014 when it acquired Oculus, a VR headset manufacture

The FTC, which voted 3-2 to approve the request to seek an injunction, argued that the acquisition of Within by Facebook would ""tend to create a monopoly"" in the market for virtual reality-dedicated fitness apps. Within has a popular fitness app called ""Supernatural.""

Facebook agreed to buy Within in October 2021for an undisclosed sum.

The FTC separately had filed an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook in 2020.

Meta said in a statement that it disagreed with the FTC's analysis of the market.

""The FTC's case is based on ideology and speculation, not evidence. The idea that this acquisition would lead to anticompetitive outcomes in a dynamic space with as much entry and growth as online and connected fitness is simply not credible,"" the company said.

""We are confident that our acquisition of Within will be good for people, developers, and the VR space,"" Meta said.

The FTC argued in its complaint that the planned acquisition was a way for Meta to dominate virtual reality, a new and fast-growing part of the internet. VR industry revenues are expected to grow from $5 billion last year to more than $12 billion in 2024, the FTC said in its complaint.

Meta already has the best-selling VR headset, the Quest 2, and controls a Meta Quest Store with hundreds of apps. It has bought game makers like Beat Games, Sanzaru and Ready at Dawn Studios, among others, the complaint said.

""Meta already owns a best-selling virtual reality fitness app, and it had the capabilities to compete even more closely with Within's popular Supernatural app,"" said John Newsman, director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, in a statement. ""But Meta chose to buy market position instead of earning it on the merits. This is an illegal acquisition, and we will pursue all appropriate relief.""

Within, founded in 2014, creates original content for virtual reality. It describes itself as ""the premier destination for cinematic virtual reality.""

Investors include venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, investment company Temasek, and movie makers like Disney, 21st Century Fox, Annapurna Pictures and Legendary Pictures, its website says.

Meta said there is ""vibrant competition"" in virtual reality market















(Reuters) - Twenty-three states including New York and California on Monday said they support the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's bid to stop Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc from buying virtual reality content maker Within Unlimited Inc, saying the deal would reduce industry competition and harm consumers.

The states filed their friend-of-the-court brief in San Jose, California, federal court, where the FTC in July asked a federal judge to bar Meta's acquisition of Los Angeles-based Within. Facebook last year agreed to buy private company Within, developer of the popular virtual-reality based fitness app Supernatural.

""Meta's acquisition of Within may substantially lessen competition and tend to create a monopoly by eliminating both perceived and actual potential competition,"" the states said in their amicus brief, which was pending a court's submission approval on Tuesday. The states, joined by the District of Columbia and Guam, said the deal threatens to ""harm competition in the emerging virtual reality space.""

A Meta spokesperson on Tuesday called the FTC's antitrust complaint ""ill-conceived"" and said the amicus brief from the states ""does nothing to change the fact that there is vibrant competition in the VR space.""

Meta has opposed the amicus submission as untimely, but the states' attorneys said there was no established deadline for friend-of-court filings.

The New York Attorney General's Office did not immediately reply to a message seeking comment, and neither did a spokesperson for the FTC.

Meta has denied the FTC's allegations and urged U.S. District Judge Edward Davila to deny the agency's bid for a preliminary injunction and to dismiss the complaint.

New York is leading a separate antitrust lawsuit against Meta over its purchase of Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion, and its purchase of WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014.

Lawyers for New York in September asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to revive the states' claims after a U.S. district court judge dismissed the case.

Utah, which also signed the amicus brief, is leading a group of states in an antitrust lawsuit challenging how Google runs its app store.

Google has denied the states' claims, saying that Google Play provides openness and choice that other platforms simply don't.""

May 11 (Reuters) - The Russian-backed Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LNR) in eastern Ukraine said on Wednesday they had blocked access to Facebook and Instagram, aligning themselves with Russia's policy on the U.S.-based social networks.

Moscow recognised the two separatist regions as independent on Feb. 21, and three days later launched a full-scale invasion of Ukrainein what it calls a ""special military operation"" aimed partly at protecting Russian-speakers there.

""Access to the information resources of the American company Meta, which allows calls for violence against Russian-speaking users on its social networks, has already been blocked,"" the DNR's communications ministry said in a statement.

""In light of this, access to the Facebook and Instagram social networks is blocked on the republic's territory.""

In a separate statement, the LNR communications ministry said it had also blocked access to the social networks.

Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Russia banned Facebook and Instagram in March after a court found Meta guilty of ""extremist activity"". Moscow had already curbed access to Facebook for restricting Russian media outlets' access to the platform.

Russia's state communications regulator blocked access to Instagram in March after Meta said it would allow social media users in Ukraine to post messages such as ""Death to the Russian invaders"".

Meta said the temporary change in its hate speech policy applied only to Ukraine.

Russia has forged close ties with Donetsk and Luhansk, collectively known as the Donbas, since supporting a pro-Russian insurgency therein 2014 followingMoscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.

The two regions receive financial support from Moscow, use the Russian rouble as their currency and teach the Russian curriculum in their schools.

WASHINGTON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. government said on Friday it was formally ending its effort to stop Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) from buying virtual reality (VR) content maker Within Unlimited.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which lost a fight in court to block the acquisition, said in a filing that it has decided to formally end its effort.

The FTC sued Meta in July to stop the Within deal, arguing that Meta's purchase would reduce competition in a new market. The deal for Within, which makes the Supernatural fitness workouts, was reportedly worth about $400 million.

Judge Edward Davila of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California rejected the FTC's concerns, and declined to order a preliminary injunction. The FTC did not appeal, and the deal closed in February.

The FTC's effort had been seen as a test of the agency's ability to prevent Meta from acquiring small would-be rivals.

Meta said in a statement that it was ""excited"" to have wrapped up the transaction to buy Within.

LONDON, June 14 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms (META.O) won an appeal against Britain blocking its acquisition of Giphy on a single procedural ground, but the country's Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) endorsed the regulator's finding that the deal could harm competition.

Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) last year ordered Meta to sell animated images platform Giphy, which it acquired for a reported $400 million, because of its concerns about a loss of a possible competitor in advertising and the potential impact on social media rivals. nL4N2SL2RD

The CAT said on Tuesday that the CMA had ""failed properly to consult"" and had ""wrongly excised portions from its decision"", adding that the parties should identify how and when the question of remittal could be determined.

It unanimously dismissed the six other grounds of appeal.

The CMA's Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli welcomed what he said was a ""resounding endorsement"" of its approach to reviewing mergers that may harm innovation.

""Innovation is a vital part of the competitive process, particularly in digital markets,"" he said. ""We also welcome the tribunal's endorsement of the 'care and careful consideration' given to this issue by the independent Inquiry Group in this case.""

A Meta spokesperson said: ""Today's ruling found that the CMA's approach to its investigation was 'difficult to defend' and 'undermines the entirety of the decision'.""

""We firmly believe our investment would enhance Giphy's product for the millions of people, businesses, and partners who use it.""

The impact of Meta winning the appeal on one ground would be determined in due course, the CMA said.

The CAT could choose to quash the entire decision and send the case back to the CMA for re-investigation. The CMA could then reach the same findings and prohibit the deal, but only after proper consultation on materials previously withheld from Meta, according to a source familiar with Meta's thinking.

209,META,2022-10-28,Zuckerberg to testify in U.S. case against Facebook's virtual reality deal,"













Oct 28 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg will testify in a case by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that argues the company's proposed deal to buy virtual reality (VR) content maker Within Unlimited should be blocked.

In a court document filed with U.S. District Court Northern District Of California on Friday, the FTC listed 18 witnesses it plans to question, including Zuckerberg, Within CEO Chris Milk and Meta Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth.

They were also on a list of witnesses submitted on Friday by defendants Meta and Within.

In addition to defending the Within acquisition, Zuckerberg is expected to be questioned about the Facebook-parent's strategy for its VR business, as well as the company's plans to support third-party developers, according to the court document.

The FTC had filed a lawsuit in July saying that Meta's acquisition of Within would ""tend to create a monopoly"" in the market for VR-dedicated fitness apps.

The regulator argues that the proposed deal would ""substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly"" in that market. read more

Meta, in court documents, has argued that ""the FTC's conclusory, speculative, and contradictory allegations do not plausibly plead any facts to establish that any supposed market for VR Deliberate Fitness apps is 'oligopolistic' as to either behavior or structure."" read more

Facebook agreed to buy Within in October 2021 for an undisclosed sum.

210,META,2022-12-01,Facebook accused by female truckers of skewing job ads,"













OAKLAND, Calif., Dec 1 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) unlawfully steered dozens of hiring ads from trucking companies and other advertisers to mostly one gender or age group, an advocacy group for female truckers alleged in a U.S. complaint on Thursday, citing the social media giant's own data.

In June, Meta said it planned to introduce a ""variance reduction system"" to its algorithms to ensure housing and employment ads reached diverse audiences in terms of age and gender on its Facebook platform.

The new allegations underscore the issues that Meta's planned system would counter. Meta on Thursday said it was reviewing the complaint and that the new system was in testing.

""Addressing fairness in ads is an industry-wide challenge and we’ve been collaborating with civil rights groups, academics and regulators to advance fairness in our ads system,"" the company said.

Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has faced years of criticism from civil rights groups and regulators about how its settings and algorithms allow for bias in access to job and housing listings. U.S. law bars discrimination based on gender or age in those ads.

""Facebook is one of the go-to resources for these life opportunities - the consequences of this kind of discrimination are far-reaching,"" said Mitra Ebadolahi, senior project director at Upturn, an advocacy group representing Real Women in Trucking on its charge to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

Real Women in Trucking's complaint lists about 80 ads from Meta's public archive that show skewed audiences.

In one example, an employer seeking truck drivers in North Carolina reached an audience that was 5% female and 11% 55 years or older.

""Women are 54% of the people on Facebook interested in job hunting. People 55 or older are 28%,"" said Peter Romer-Friedman, principal at law firm Gupta Wessler, representing Real Women in Trucking.

""There’s no reason that job ads should be sent to a fraction of those numbers on a routine basis,"" he said.

Most employers intended to reach broader audiences, he added.

But the charge cites three ads for which Meta let advertisers select age-restricted audiences, an option it promised to block for job ads in 2019.

If Meta is struggling to identify job ads, it may likewise face difficulties applying the planned variance reductions, Romer-Friedman said.

""It will be the place I share Meta product news first.""

213,META,2022-10-27,Investors punish Zuckerberg as costly metaverse pitch falls flat,"













Oct 26 (Reuters) - Wall Street is losing patience over Meta (META.O) boss Mark Zuckerberg's enormous and experimental bets on his metaverse project that helped drive up the company's overall costs by a fifth in the third quarter.

Investors rushed to dump Meta Platforms Inc's stock after hours, pushing it down 20% and wiping $67 billion off its market value after the company posted its fourth straight decline in quarterly profit.

The Facebook-parent said its overall expenses could rise as much as 16% next year and anticipates that operating losses at Reality Labs - the unit responsible for bringing the metaverse to life - ""will grow significantly"" next year.

One Meta shareholder had recently voiced concerns calling the company's investments ""super-sized and terrifying"". Analysts on Wednesday called them ""confusing and confounding"" and Meta's inability to cut costs ""extremely disturbing"".

On a post-earnings conference call, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill asked executives: ""I think kind of summing up how investors are feeling right now is that there are just too many experimental bets versus proven bets on the core ... I think everyone would love to hear why you think this pays off.""

In the July-September quarter, losses at Reality Labs ballooned to a whopping $3.67 billion from $2.63 billion a year earlier. Revenue nearly halved.

""It would be a mistake for us to not focus on any of these areas that will be fundamentally important to our future,"" Zuckerberg said on the call.

""I know that sometimes when we ship a product ... people say: 'Hey, you're spending all this money, and you've produced this thing,' and I think that's not really the right way to think about it.""

""...we're doing leading work that will become ... eventually mature products at different cadences in different periods of time over the next five to 10 years.""

He spoke about the company's various efforts, including a recently unveiled virtual and mixed reality headset called Quest Pro that is priced at $1,500 and a social metaverse platform where people can express themselves via avatars.

He said Meta is investing in two other areas: augmented reality and neural interfaces.

BIG GAMBLE

""The metaverse ... feels like a one big gamble given the economic crisis,"" said Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, adding that the journey ahead was going to be ""long and painful"".

""People are not rushing out of their seats to buy a VR headset or even watch 360 degree videos ... The new device still feels like an expensive toy,"" he said.

At a time when other tech companies such as Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) are cutting jobs or slowing hiring, Meta's headcount surged 32% in the third quarter from the end of the second.

In an open letter to Zuckerberg on Monday, Meta shareholder Altimeter Capital Management called on Meta to streamline by cutting jobs and capital expenditure.

The fund suggested Meta cap annual investments in the metaverse to $5 billion instead of the current $10 billion.

214,META,2022-11-28,Irish privacy regulator fines Facebook 265 mln euros,"













DUBLIN, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Ireland's data privacy regulator imposed a 265 million euro ($277 million) fine on social media giant Facebook on Monday, bringing the total it has fined parent group Meta (META.O) to almost 1 billion euros.

The penalty resulted from an investigation, started last year, into the discovery of a collated set of personal data that had been scraped from Facebook between May 2018 and September 2019, and made available online.

Facebook was also ordered to make a range of corrective measures.

Meta said it had cooperated fully with the investigation by Ireland's Data Privacy Commissioner (DPC) and made changes to its systems during the time in question, including removing the ability to scrape its features in this way using phone numbers.

Monday's fine is the fourth the DPC has levied against one of Meta's companies. It is Meta's lead privacy regulator within the European Union, and has 13 more inquiries into the social media group outstanding.

In September the watchdog hit its Instagram subsidiary with a record fine of 405 million euros, which Meta plans to appeal. Meta added in its statement on Monday that it was reviewing the decision related to the latest fine.

The DPC regulates Apple, Google, Twitter, Tiktok and other technology giants due to the location of their EU headquarters in Ireland. It currently has 40 inquiries open into such firms, including the 13 involving Meta.

The regulator has the power to impose fines of up to 4% of a company's global revenue under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation's (GDPR) ""One Stop Shop"" regime introduced in 2018.

The DPC said mitigating factors in Monday's decision - which had been approved by all other relevant EU regulators - included the actions Facebook had taken.

""We'll keep going until the behaviour does change,"" Ireland's Data Privacy Commissioner (DPC) Helen Dixon told Irish national broadcaster RTE on Monday.

NEW DELHI, Nov 15 (Reuters) - WhatsApp's India head Abhijit Bose and Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) public policy director in India Rajiv Aggarwal have resigned, a Meta spokesperson said on Tuesday.

The departures follow the exit of Meta's India head Ajit Mohan, who quit this month after four years in the job to join rival Snap Inc (SNAP.N).

Meta is also in the middle of massive layoffs announced last week, cutting more than 11,000 jobs or 13% of its workforce, as the Facebook parent doubles down on its metaverse bet amid a crumbling advertising market and decades-high inflation.

A Meta spokesperson said both of the exits were unrelated to the current layoffs.

Meta has appointed Shivnath Thukral as its new director for public policy in India and the company will look for a replacement for Bose, the spokesperson said.

Facebook has been facing regulatory challenges in India where Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration has been tightening laws governing Big Tech companies.

WhatsApp, the messaging service owned by Meta, has also been seeking to ramp up its payments service in a highly competitive market and take on more established players such as Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google Pay, Ant Group-backed Paytm (PAYT.NS) and Walmart's (WMT.N) PhonePe.

Couple of months back, the head of WhatsApp's India payment business, Manesh Mahatme, also quit to join Amazon India.

216,META,2022-05-19,"WhatsApp to launch cloud-based tools, premium features for businesses","













May 19 (Reuters) - WhatsApp is introducing free cloud-based API services in a push to get more businesses using the app, Meta Platforms (FB.O) CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced at the company's messaging event on Thursday.

The messaging service, which has increasingly courted business users, is one of several platforms where Facebook-owner Meta has launched more shopping and business-focused features.

Zuckerberg, speaking at Meta's ""Conversations"" event, said the offering would mean ""any business or developer can easily access our service, build directly on top of WhatsApp to customize their experience and speed up their response time to customers by using our secure WhatsApp Cloud API hosted by Meta.""

WhatsApp already has an API, or type of software interface, for businesses to connect their systems and engage in customer service chats on the service, which generates revenue for Meta.

Meta, which bought WhatsApp for $19 billion in a landmark 2014 deal, said that businesses would not be able to message people on WhatsApp unless they have requested to be contacted.

WhatsApp also said on Thursday it was planning to provide optional paid features as part of a new premium service for users of its specialized business app, which is geared at small businesses.

Those features, which are still being developed, will include options to manage chats across up to 10 devices and customized click-to-chat links that businesses can post on their websites and share with customers.

Uber (UBER.N) CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, speaking in a session with Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg at the conference, said a third of the users ordering rides via WhatsApp in India are new customers.

The ride-hailing company, which launched its WhatsApp chatbot in December, is now planning to further customize the service starting for users in and around Delhi and expanding to markets like Brazil, he said. read more

BENGALURU/NEW DELHI, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) India head Ajit Mohan has quit after four years in the role to join rival Snap Inc (SNAP.N), the companies said on Thursday, a high-profile exit for the Facebook parent in its biggest market.

Mohan has stepped down with immediate effect and Manish Chopra, director and head of partnerships at Meta India, will take over as interim head, a Meta spokesperson told Reuters.

Mohan will join Snap as president, Asia-Pacific and report into Chief Operating Officer Jerry Hunter, a Snap spokesperson told Reuters.

His exit comes as Facebook faces a host of regulatory challenges in the country where Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration has been tightening laws governing Big Tech companies.

The company has for years faced criticism for doing little to curb the spread of fake news and hate speech in India.

During Mohan's tenure, Meta navigated stricter calls from the Indian authorities to regulate content including hiring local nodal officers, and worked to secure a peer-to-peer payments license for WhatsApp messaging app.

Facebook had nearly 450 million users in India as of November 2021, while WhatsApp had 563 million users.

Meta will work on a transition plan over the next few weeks and Vice President for Asia Pacific, Dan Neary, would ""soon"" be in India and host an all-hands meeting, Nicola Mendelsohn, Vice President of the global business group at Meta, said in an internal message to staff.

March 17 (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Donald Trump posted to Facebook on Friday, marking his return to the social media platform two years after he was banned.

Meta Platforms (META.O), which owns Facebook and Instagram, announced on Jan. 25 that it would reinstate Trump's access to his accounts, saying the public should be allowed to hear from politicians, but that Trump would be subject to ""heightened penalties"" for repeated violations of its rules.

The former president was suspended for praising rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

Despite Trump's reinstatement, it had been unclear whether he would post on the accounts.

Facebook and Instagram are key vehicles for reaching voters and fundraising and could give a boost to Trump, who will make another run for the presidency in 2024. Trump had 23 million followers on Instagram and 34 million on Facebook as of Feb. 9.

Trump's campaign spokesman told Fox News Digital in January that being back on Facebook ""will be an important tool for the 2024 campaign to reach voters.""

Trump founded his own social media platform called Truth Social in late 2021, which he relied on to communicate with supporters during his ban from Twitter and Meta.

Opponents of Trump's return point to the messages he has posted on Truth Social as evidence that he continues to pose the same risk that led Meta to suspend him in the first place.

More than 350 of his Truth Social posts would have violated Facebook's rules, including posts amplifying the conspiracy theory QAnon and pushing false claims of election fraud, liberal advocacy group Accountable Tech said in a December report.

In a blog post, Meta said it updated its protocols on moderating public figures during times of civil unrest. Under the protocol, Meta said it may restrict the distribution of a Trump post that doesn't violate its rules but ""contributes to the sort of risk that materialized on Jan. 6.""

A restriction would mean the posts would remain available on Trump's profile, but would not be distributed in users' feeds, even if they follow Trump, Meta said.

The company said it could also prevent the posts from being reshared or run as paid ads.

Ad buyers previously told Reuters that Trump's reinstatement was unlikely to change how brands advertise on the platforms, but it reinforced long-standing concerns about how Meta prevents ads from appearing next to certain content.

220,META,2022-06-01,Facebook sans Sandberg is more vision than company,"













WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Sheryl Sandberg’s exit from Meta Platforms (FB.O) comes at a bad time for the Facebook parent. While the social network had problems under its departing chief operating officer, it at least had a business model and a top-tier executive who could sell it to investors. Both of those will be hard for co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, whose ambitions lie in more abstract directions, to replace.

Since Sandberg started at the then-startup in 2008, Facebook has grown prodigiously – from $272 million of revenue then to $118 billion last year. That’s mostly down to selling advertising. Sandberg had previously been in charge of online sales at Alphabet’s (GOOGL.O) Google before she joined. She also helped Facebook navigate a boycott by major companies like Ford Motor and Adidas in 2020 without revenue shrinking, and the hit from Covid-19. Facebook is now just behind Google for U.S. online ad market share at about 24%, according to eMarketer.

But challenges have mounted under her watch. First, that ad engine is already slowing. MoffettNathanson reckons Google’s online ad sales will increase 16% this year, while Facebook is expected to squeak by with 2%. The company has slowed hiring and investment and faces increasing competition – both for ads and users – from Chinese-owned TikTok. Sandberg and Zuckerberg failed to stop the platform being used for foreign interference in U.S. elections and the planning of last year’s riots at the Capitol building. Facebook’s user base also contracted for the first time ever at the end of 2021.

Sandberg takes with her two things Meta still needs. One is Washington experience: she was chief of staff for former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and took a hands-on approach to engaging with regulators, though that didn't stop Facebook from being a target. The other is financial credibility. Zuckerberg’s focus on augmented and virtual realities is visionary but highly uncertain from an investor’s perspective. The company spent $10 billion on the so-called metaverse in 2021 and says the unit will lose money for some time. Sandberg’s replacement, Javier Olivan, is an expert in products, not finance.

Meta shares had barely moved by the end of Wednesday’s trading. But the company’s stock is already down more than 43% over the past year. The Nasdaq 100 index is down just 8% over that time, and Alphabet shares only half that. That shows that while Sandberg’s departure may not bring new problems, she’s leaving when the company still lacks solutions to its existing ones.

March 29 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge ruled on Tuesday that a lawsuit accusing Meta Platforms Inc's (FB.O) Facebook of deceiving advertisers about its ""potential reach"" tool can proceed as a class action.

The decision by U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco allows potentially millions of individuals and businesses that paid for ads on Facebook and its photo-sharing app Instagram since Aug. 15, 2014 to sue as a group.

Meta did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.

The lawsuit began in 2018, as DZ Reserve and other advertisers accused Facebook of inflating its advertising reach, by increasing the number of potential viewers by as much as 400%, and charging artificially high premiums for ad placements.

They also said senior Facebook executives knew for years that the company's ""potential reach"" metric was inflated by duplicate and fake accounts, yet did nothing about it and took steps to cover it up.

After calling out Meta's ""blunderbuss"" objections to class certification, Donato rejected its contention that the class was too diverse, including ""large sophisticated corporations"" as well as individuals and small businesses, and that it would be too hard to calculate damages.

Donato also said it made sense to let individual plaintiffs sue as a group, given that ""no reasonable person"" would sue Meta individually to recover at most a $32 price premium.

The judge is expected later this year to consider Meta's bid to dismiss the lawsuit.

222,META,2022-10-07,"Instagram, TikTok teen addiction lawsuits grouped in northern California","Summary

Summary Law firms

Law firms Related documents New industrywide MDL combines cases against Meta’s Instagram and Facebook, plus TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube

Plaintiffs accuse the social-media apps of defective design, failure to warn of potential harm















(Reuters) - More than 80 cases alleging that TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and other social media sites are designed to hook young users – even at the cost of their physical and mental health – will be grouped for pretrial proceedings in federal court in Oakland, California, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ruled Thursday.

The panel opted for industrywide multidistrict litigation (MDL) for the lawsuits, even though 70 percent of the cases so far name only Meta Platforms’ Facebook or Instagram as defendants.

Meta supported plaintiff Brianna Murden’s motion to create the MDL. The parent companies of Snapchat, TikTok, and YouTube vehemently opposed it, arguing that their services operate differently from Meta’s and that a “behemoth, industrywide MDL” would be unmanageable.

The panel, however, identified several overlapping areas, including allegations of “indivisible injuries from multiple products,” and the companies' ""likely"" common defenses – particularly that they are shielded from liability by the Communications Decency Act and the Free Speech clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

“Centralization of all actions, therefore, will allow for efficient coordination of briefing and rulings on motions to dismiss, as well as (evidentiary) motions,” U.S. District Judge Karen Caldwell, who chairs the JPML, wrote Thursday.

Murden’s lawyer, Joseph VanZandt of Beasley Allen Crow Methvin Portis & Miles, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A representative for Meta said the company cannot comment on pending litigation. Attorneys for the other defendants had no immediate response.

When VanZandt filed the motion on Aug. 1, just 28 cases were pending. Now there are at least 84, the panel said.

All the actions were filed after former Facebook employee Frances Haugen told Congress last year that “internal Meta documents show that Defendants were aware of the harm its products cause users, especially female children and adolescents,” the motion said.

Murden, 21, alleges that she started using Facebook and Instagram at age 10 and developed “social media compulsion, disordered eating, depression, body dysmorphic disorder, multiple periods of suicidal ideation, severe anxiety,” and other injuries as a result.

She asked the JPML to assign the cases to a federal judge in Chicago or Western Missouri. Although Meta is based in northern California, it asked the panel to choose a less-busy court.

The panel chose the Northern District of California because all defendants are headquartered or have significant operations in the state. It assigned the cases to U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, an experienced MDL judge.

“We are confident she will steer this matter on a prudent course,” the panel said.

The case is In re: Social Media Adolescent Addiction/Personal Injury Products Liability Litigation, MDL No. 3047.

223,META,2022-11-10,U.S. judge hearing FTC case against Facebook won't quash subpoena for Sequoia,"













WASHINGTON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge hearing a big antitrust case against Meta's (META.O) Facebook declined on Thursday to quash a subpoena that the government had sent to Sequoia Capital seeking its analyses of Instagram and WhatsApp before they were acquired by Meta.

The Federal Trade Commission, which has filed a lawsuit asking the judge to force Meta to sell Instagram and WhatsApp, had sought depositions of one current and one former Sequoia executive.

The FTC, in court papers, describes Sequoia's Roelof Botha as a lead investor in Instagram shortly before Meta bought it while it says Jim Goetz is a retired Sequoia partner who helped negotiate the WhatsApp acquisition.

Sequoia had argued in court filings that the depositions were ""unduly burdensome and not proportional to the needs of this case.""

In a brief hearing, Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said: ""I'm going to deny the motion to quash."" He urged the parties to return to court if they failed to agree on how long the depositions would be.

The FTC filed a lawsuit in 2020 asking a court to undo then-Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014. It said that the company acted illegally to maintain its social network monopoly.

224,META,2022-07-15,Amazon pauses work on six new U.S. office buildings to weigh hybrid work needs,"













July 15 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) is pausing the construction of six new office buildings in Bellevue and Nashville to reevaluate the designs to suit hybrid work, the tech giant said on Friday.

The pausing and delay of construction will not affect Amazon's hiring plans, a company spokesperson said, reiterating the firm's proposal to create 25,000 jobs in Bellevue and another 5,000 in Nashville.

""The pandemic has significantly changed the way people work ... Our offices are long-term investments and we want to make sure that we design them in a way that meets our employees' needs in the future,"" said John Schoettler, vice president of Global Real Estate and Facilities at Amazon.

Separately, Bloomberg News reported on Friday that Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META.O) and Amazon have pulled back on their office expansion plans in New York City. (https://bit.ly/3PvFMeD)

Meta has decided not to take an additional 300,000 square feet of space at 770 Broadway, a building near Astor Place where it is already located and Amazon has cut down the amount of space it intended to lease from JPMorgan Chase & Co at Hudson Yards, the report said.

""There are often a number of reasons why we wouldn't proceed with a particular deal, including office utilization. The past few years have brought new possibilities around the ways we connect and work,"" a Meta spokesperson told Reuters without confirming or denying the report.

""We remain firmly committed to New York and look forward to opening the Farley in the coming months,"" the spokesperson added.

Amazon declined to comment on the report.

226,META,2023-01-30,Facebook seeks to block $3.7 billion UK mass action over market dominance,"













LONDON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Facebook on Monday asked a London tribunal to block a collective lawsuit valued at up to 3 billion pounds ($3.7 billion) over allegations the social media giant abused its dominant position to monetise users’ personal data.

Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), the parent company of the Facebook group, is facing a mass action brought on behalf of around 45 million Facebook users in Britain.

Legal academic Liza Lovdahl Gormsen, who is bringing the case, said Facebook users were not properly compensated for the value of personal data that they had to provide to use the platform.

Her lawyers said users should get compensation for the economic value they would have received if Facebook was not in a dominant position in the market for social networks.

But Meta said the lawsuit was “entirely without merit” and should not be allowed to proceed. Its lawyers said the claimed losses ignore the “economic value” Facebook provides.

Lovdahl Gormsen’s lawyers on Monday asked the Competition Appeal Tribunal to certify the case under the UK’s collective proceedings regime – which is roughly equivalent to the class action regime in the United States.

A decision to certify collective proceedings will depend on whether the tribunal decides that the individual cases can appropriately be dealt with together, rather than on their merits.

Ronit Kreisberger, representing Lovdahl Gormsen, told the tribunal that “Meta’s data practices violate the prohibition on abusive conduct by dominant firms”.

“There is unquestionably a case for Meta to answer at trial,” Kreisberger argued.

But lawyers representing Meta said the lawsuit wrongly assumes that any “excess profits” it might make equates to a financial loss suffered by individual Facebook users.

This approach “takes no account whatsoever of the significant economic value of the service provided by Facebook”, Marie Demetriou said in court documents.

She said Lovdahl Gormsen’s estimate of potential claimants’ total losses – 3 billion pounds, including interest – is “at the very least wildly inflated”.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo















SAO PAULO, April 7 (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta Platforms (FB.O) said on Thursday it had removed a network of social media accounts with ties to the Brazilian military that posed as fake nonprofits to play down the dangers of deforestation.

Although the individuals involved in the network were active military personnel, Meta's investigation did not find enough evidence to establish if they were following orders or acting independently, said a person with knowledge of the matter.

Meta's quarterly report could be damaging to Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro. The far-right former army captain, a longtime skeptic of environmentalism, has deployed the armed forces to the Amazon on unsuccessful missions to reduce destruction of the world's largest rainforest. read more

The takedown operation, Meta's first to hit a network focused primarily on environmental issues, may also add fire to Bolsonaro's attacks on large tech firms, which he accuses of stifling conservative voices on their platforms.

Critics say Bolsonaro and his supporters use the platforms to spread dangerous disinformation undermining Brazil's democratic institutions.

In its report, Meta said the unidentified network, which was limited in scale and authentic engagement, used fake accounts on Facebook and Instagram to post initially about land reform and the pandemic in 2020 before turning its focus to environmental issues last year.

""In 2021, they created Pages that posed as fictitious NGOs and activists focused on environmental issues in the Amazonas region of Brazil. They posted about deforestation, including arguing that not all of it is harmful, and criticizing legitimate environmental NGOs who spoke out against deforestation in the Amazon,"" Meta said in its report.

""Although the people behind (the network) attempted to conceal their identities and coordination, our investigation found links to individuals associated with the Brazilian Military.""

Meta declined to provide additional information about its investigation.

Brazil's army said in a statement it was aware of Meta's allegations, and had reached out to the company for access to the data underpinning its claims of military involvement.

It said it required all of its members to practice ""truth, probity and honesty.""

Bolsonaro's office did not reply to a request for comment.

Summary

Summary Companies Meta's internal research reveals challenges in India

Many women steered clear of male-dominated Facebook

Their concerns included safety and unwanted contacts

Facebook growth lags sisters WhatsApp and Instagram















NEW DELHI, July 21 (Reuters) - On Feb. 2, when Meta Platforms (META.O) reported Facebook's first-ever quarterly drop in daily users, its finance chief identified higher mobile data costs as a unique obstacle slowing growth in India, its biggest market.

On the same day, the U.S. tech group posted the findings of its own research into Facebook's business in India on an internal employee forum. The study, conducted over the two years to the end of 2021, identified different problems.

Many women have shunned the male-dominated social network because they're worried about their safety and privacy, according to the Meta research, which hasn't been previously reported.

""Concerns about content safety and unwanted contact impede women's FB use,"" said the study, reviewed by Reuters, as it detailed the platform's main challenges.

""Meta cannot succeed in India while leaving women behind.""

Other obstacles included nudity content, the perceived complexity of its app design, local language and literacy barriers and a lack of appeal among internet users seeking video content, according to the research, which was based on surveys of tens of thousands of people as well as internal user data.

Facebook's growth began plateauing last year, when it added a few million users in the space of six months in the country of about 1.4 billion people, significantly lagging sister apps WhatsApp and Instagram, according to the report, which noted: ""FB has grown more slowly than the internet and other apps.""

A Meta spokesperson, contacted about the study, said the company regularly invested in internal research to better understand the value its products provide and help identify ways to improve.

""But it's misleading to characterize 7-month-old research as an accurate or comprehensive representation of the state of our business in India,"" they added.

Nonetheless, the main Indian issues detailed in the research were not cited by Meta's chief financial officer, Dave Wehner, on a Feb. 2 call with analysts to discuss results for the final quarter of 2021. read more

Wehner said Facebook's user growth in Asia-Pacific and some other areas was hit by competition, plus comparison with prior quarters when COVID resurgences aided user engagement. He identified higher mobile data costs as a ""unique"" headwind for India.

Asked why the obstacles to growth identified by Wehner were different from those identified in the research, the spokesperson pointed to a Meta filing in April, during its first-quarter earnings, where it said Facebook users in India, Bangladesh and Vietnam represented the top three sources of growth in daily active users in March versus a year before.

Facebook's fortunes in India have broad implications for Meta, which has lost about half of its value this year amid a broader tech sell-off and faces scrutiny from investors and analysts who fear its growth in potentially high-growth developing markets is starting to wane. read more

""India contains more FB users than any other country,"" said the research, which pegged the number at almost 450 million as of November, after rapid growth over much of the past decade.

""Teams across the company should explicitly consider their strategic position and growth opportunities in India. Outcomes in India could drive global results.""

FAMILY DOESN'T ALLOW FB

The internal study, a ""high-level overview of the growth trends"" in India, was detailed in a presentation meant to help Facebook's researchers and product teams. It said that a key problem Facebook had tried to fix for years in India, with limited success, was related to ""gender imbalance"".

Men accounted for 75% of Facebook's monthly active users in India last year. That compared with 62% of internet users more broadly in early 2020, the researchers found.

""While there is a gender imbalance in internet use across India, the imbalance among Facebook users is even more pronounced,"" said the study, adding that online safety concerns and societal pressures were among reasons deterring women from the platform.

The researchers found that 79% of female Facebook users had ""expressed concern about content/photo misuse"", while 20-30% of overall users were estimated to have seen nudity on the platform within the last seven days in the largely conservative country.

India ranked highest globally on the latter metric; around 10% of users surveyed in the United States and Brazil said they had seen nudity in the past week, for example, and under 20% in Indonesia, according to a survey conducted in August 2021.

""Negative content is more prevalent in India than other countries,"" said the internal report.

Family disapproval – ""Family doesn't allow FB"" - was a major reason cited by women for not using Facebook, the study found.

The Meta spokesperson said the online gender imbalance was an industry-wide problem and not specific to its platforms.

They said that since 2016, Meta had quadrupled the size of the global team working on safety and security to over 40,000, and that between January and April this year, more than 97% of adult nudity and sexual activity content was removed before someone reported it.

WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

Depicting struggles of women users, one research slide showed a picture of an Indian woman walking on a street wearing a saree with which she covered her head and face, a tradition common in many parts of India.

Next to this image was the account of a woman who said she had received 367 friend requests from strangers, with a string of comments on photos like ""very beautiful"", ""where do you live"", ""you look good"".

The comments stopped after she used the ""locked profile"" feature, according to the woman cited, referring to an option Facebook introduced in 2020 in India allowing users to restrict viewing of pictures and posts to non-friends.

By June 2021, the feature had been adopted by 34% of women users in India, said the internal report, but more work was needed, with ""bold product changes"", to address the problem of low uptake of Facebook among women.

Facebook has faced criticism globally from online safety campaigners for not doing enough to safeguard women from bullying or harassment. In 2019, the platform said it had a team of people focusing ""just on making sure we are keeping women safe"", using technology tools to remove content deemed unsafe.

The Meta spokesperson said it had launched a Women's Safety Hub and other privacy features such as a profanity filter to help female users in India stay safe online. Since 2021, more than 45% of Facebook Groups in India related to entrepreneurship have been created by women, Meta added.

WHATSAPP GRABS CROWN

Facebook's growth in India began to level off last year, according to the internal research. The platform's main appeal has been to connect with friends and family, but non-Facebook users were primarily now using the internet to see pictures and videos, the research noted.

Its annualised growth rate based on May-October 2021 showed it was adding just 6.6 million users per year, versus WhatsApp's 71 million and Instagram's 128 million, according to one internal slide that illustrated the slowdown graphically.

By November, Facebook's user base in India was 447 million strong, lagging its Meta sister apps. WhatsApp - which Facebook acquired in 2014 - had 563 million Indian users. Instagram, bought in 2012, had 309 million.

The slowdown stands in contrast to Facebook's strong expansion in past years. In 2014, the platform had fewer than 100 million users in India, a number that doubled by 2017, the research said.

The Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the user numbers, saying it didn't disclose country-specific data. They said the company was ""definitely increasing the prominence of video"" on Facebook.

Lower-educated users are another group that is underrepresented on Facebook, according to the research. The platform faced challenges in meeting demand for content in India's many local languages, while many people cited the app's complexity and lack of tutorials as deterrents.

Between 2017 and 2020, India's monthly online users as a share of the population doubled, boosted by cheaper data plans, but the share of internet users who reported they used Facebook declined during that period, the study found.

""India is now the country with more Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram accounts than any other country in the world,"" said an internal post accompanying the report. ""But continued growth in India faces many challenges.""

229,META,2022-09-20,"Meta's privacy obligations may be added to German antitrust probe, court adviser says","













LUXEMBOURG, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Antitrust authorities may assess whether companies comply with EU data protection rules during their investigations, an adviser to Europe's top court said on Tuesday, dealing a possible blow to Meta Platforms (META.O) in its fight against the German competition agency.

The non-binding opinion, if followed by the Court of the Justice of the Europe Union (CJEU) in the coming weeks, could further embolden the German enforcer and its peers in other EU countries to widen their scrutiny of Big Tech based on privacy rules.

Meta's battle with the German cartel office started in 2019 after the latter said the world's largest social network had abused its market power by collecting users' data without their consent and ordered it to stop.

The company, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, challenged the finding. At issue is whether the German antitrust agency overstepped its authority by using its antitrust power to address data protection concerns, which are the remit of national data protection authorities.

A German court subsequently sought guidance from the CJEU.

Advocate General Athanasios Rantos at the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) said whether a company complies with the bloc's landmark privacy rules may be an important indication of whether its conduct breaches competition rules.

""A competition authority may, in exercising its powers, take account of the compatibility of a commercial practice with the General Data Protection Regulation,"" he said in a non-binding opinion.

He said antitrust watchdogs however need to consult with the lead privacy enforcers as well, which in Meta's case is the Irish data protection agency as its European headquarters is based there.

""However, it must take into account any decision or investigation by the competent authority under that Regulation,"" he said.

Meta said: ""We await the final judgment to determine any next steps.""

The court, which usually follows the majority of such recommendations, will rule in the coming months.

Meta is also in the German watchdog's crosshairs for linking its Oculus virtual reality products with the social network and its platform.

In May, it was designated by the German authority as of ""paramount importance for competition across markets"" subject to tougher rules.

The case is C252/21 Meta Platforms and others (general conditions of use of a social network).

230,META,2022-09-05,Ireland fines Instagram a record $400 mln over children's data,"Summary

Summary Companies Phone numbers, emails of some teens were public

Instagram has changed settings, will appeal















DUBLIN, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Ireland's data privacy regulator has agreed to levy a record fine of 405 million euros ($402 million) against social network Instagram following an investigation into its handling of children's data, a spokesperson for the watchdog said.

Instagram plans to appeal against the fine, a spokesperson for parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) said in an emailed statement.

The investigation, which started in 2020, focused on child users between the ages of 13 and 17 who were allowed to operate business accounts, which facilitated the publication of the user's phone number and/or email address.

""We adopted our final decision last Friday and it does contain a fine of 405 million euro,"" said the spokesperson for Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner (DPC), the lead regulator of Instagram's parent company Meta Platforms Inc (META.O).

Full details of the decision will be published next week, he said.

Instagram updated its settings over a year ago and has since released new features to keep teens safe and their information private, the Meta spokesperson said.

The spokesperson said Instagram disagrees with how the fine was calculated and is carefully reviewing the decision.

The DPC regulates Facebook, Apple, Google and other technology giants due to the location of their EU headquarters in Ireland. It has opened over a dozen investigations into Meta companies, including Facebook and WhatsApp.

WhatsApp was last year fined a record 225 million euros for failing to conform with EU data rules in 2018.

The Irish regulator completed a draft ruling in the Instagram investigation in December and shared it with other European Union regulators under the bloc's ""one stop shop"" system of regulating large multinationals.

DUBLIN, July 7 (Reuters) - Ireland's data privacy regulator moved a step closer to a ruling that could halt EU-U.S. data transfers by Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram when it shared an updated draft order with other EU regulators on Thursday, a spokesperson said.

The Data Protection Commission (DPC) issued a provisional order in 2020 to block the mechanism Meta uses to transfer data on EU users to the United States, after Europe's highest court deemed the agreement allowing it invalid due to surveillance concerns.

After the block was issued the European Union and United States announced a preliminary data transfer deal to end the limbo, and data flows have continued pending a final agreement.

However, the DPC's probe has continued in parallel, and it informed its EU counterparts of a draft of its final decision on Thursday, the spokesperson. The spokesperson declined to comment on the specific content of the decision.

The DPC is the EU's lead regulator of Meta and many other of the world's largest technology companies, due to the location of their EU headquarters in Ireland.

Under EU privacy rules introduced in 2018, regulators around the bloc have one month to give their input before a final decision is reached. Any objections, which have regularly been lodged in such cases, could add months to the timeline.

Meta has warned a stoppage will likely leave it unable to offer significant services such as Facebook and Instagram in Europe without a new transatlantic data transfer framework.

DPC head Helen Dixon told Reuters in February that a halt to Meta's data flows would not immediately hit other big tech companies, but that there would potentially be ""hundreds of thousands of entities"" that would have to be looked at. read more

The final Irish order would not apply to Meta's WhatsApp subsidiary, as it has a different data controller within the group.

""This draft decision, which is subject to review by European Data Protection Authorities, relates to a conflict of EU and U.S. law which is in the process of being resolved,"" a Meta spokesperson said on Thursday.

""We welcome the EU-U.S. agreement for a new legal framework that will allow the continued transfer of data across borders, and we expect this framework will allow us to keep families, communities and economies connected.""

When the provisional agreement was struck in March, EU officials said it would likely take months to turn it into a final legal deal.

232,META,2022-10-11,"Meta's new Quest Pro headset, mixing real and virtual worlds, makes debut","













Oct 11 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms (META.O) unveiled its Quest Pro virtual and mixed reality headset on Tuesday, marking a milestone for Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's break into the higher-end market for extended reality computing devices.

The headset, introduced at Meta's annual Connect conference, will hit shelves on Oct. 25 at a price of $1,500, and will offer consumers a way to interact with virtual creations overlaid onto a full-color view of the physical world around them.

The launch is an important step for Zuckerberg, who last year announced plans for the device - then called Project Cambria - at the same time that he changed his company's name from Facebook to Meta to signal his intention to refocus the social media giant into a company that operates a shared immersive computing experience known as the metaverse.

Zuckerberg has since poured billions of dollars into that vision. Reality Labs, the Meta unit responsible for bringing the metaverse to life, lost $10.2 billion in 2021 and has lost nearly $6 billion so far this year.

In a speech at the event, Zuckerberg, recorded partially in video and partially as an avatar, said he expects the blending of the physical and digital worlds to give rise to new uses for computing.

""You're going to see entirely new categories of things getting built,"" he said.

The Quest Pro features several upgrades over Meta's existing Quest 2 headset, which overwhelmingly dominates the consumer virtual reality market.

Most strikingly, it has outward-facing cameras that capture a sort of 3D livestream of the physical environment around a wearer, enabling mixed reality novelties like the ability to hang a virtual painting on a real-world wall or have a virtual ball bounce off a real table.

The Quest 2, by contrast, offers a more rudimentary grayscale version of this technology, called passthrough.

The Quest Pro feels lighter and slimmer than its predecessors, with thin pancake lenses and a relocated battery that sits at the back of the headset, distributing its weight more evenly while reducing overall bulk.

For fully immersive virtual reality, Meta has added tracking sensors to the Quest Pro that can replicate users' eye movements and facial expressions, creating a sense that avatars are making eye contact.

PITCHING PRODUCTIVITY

Meta is pitching the Quest Pro as a productivity device, aimed at designers, architects and other creative professionals.

In addition to offering its own Horizon social and workspace platforms, the company has also made virtual versions of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) work products like Word, Outlook and Teams available, a partnership Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella joined Zuckerberg to announce.

Matthew Ball, a venture capitalist whose writings about the metaverse have drawn Zuckerberg's praise, said he considered such partnerships significant because they suggested the companies' commitment to interoperability, or the idea that different systems should connect with each another.

""There is a lot of skepticism in the market as to whether an interoperable and open metaverse is even possible, let alone likely,"" he said, noting that Microsoft and Meta compete on several products in the extended reality space.

At a preview of Quest Pro days before its launch, Meta gave reporters a glimpse of the type of user it had in mind for its productivity pitch by showcasing apps like Tribe XR, a virtual training environment for DJs.

Tribe XR is already available in virtual reality, but a demonstration showed how passthrough technology may enable DJs to use the app to play real-world gigs, as it means they can look out past their virtual equipment at actual partygoers.

Meta plans to sell the Quest Pro in consumer channels to start, while adding enterprise-level capabilities like mobile device management, authentication and premium support services next year, executives said at the press event.

They said the device is intended to complement rather than replace the entry-level Quest 2, which sells for $399.99.

For now, that means the Quest Pro stops short of enabling the complex commercial applications Meta has suggested it wants its metaverse technology to support.

The company is still working on a mixed reality experience for its Horizon Workrooms app that would make a person's avatar appear to be present in a real-world conference room with other users, which it is calling Magic Rooms.

It is also planning to add legs to its avatars, which are currently displayed from the waist up, Zuckerberg said.

Still, the Quest Pro's price point puts it well under the cost of existing enterprise-focused devices like Microsoft's Hololens 2, which was released for commercial use in 2019 and is already present in operating rooms and on factory floors.

An entry-level Hololens 2 sells for $3,500.

234,META,2022-07-21,Meta's Facebook revamping main feed to attract younger users,"













July 21 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms (META.O) said on Thursday it was revamping the main feed on its Facebook app to prioritize ""discovery"" of new content, instead of posts from accounts users follow, a bid to style its apps after short-form video competitor TikTok.

Meta executives have voiced increased urgency in recent months around boosting the company's ""Reels"" product, similar to TikTok's short video format that has attracted many younger users.

""Home"", Facebook's main news feed tab that users will see when they open the app, will start more heavily featuring popular posts from accounts that users do not follow, including Reels and Stories, Meta said in a statement.

Facebook will suggest posts to users with its machine learning ranking system and is investing in artificial intelligence (AI) to serve recommended content, it added.

A new separate tab called 'Feeds' will offer aversion of the old approach, which overwhelmingly features posts from friends, pages and groups that users actively choose to follow.

Feeds in that tab will be presented chronologically, without personalized ranking, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post. Meta said the feeds will not include suggested posts but will still have advertisements.

The world's biggest social media company has gone all in on algorithmic recommendations in recent months as the threat from TikTok has grown, a stark change from its 2018 plan to feature more posts from friends and family in the news feed.

Its Instagram app announced tests of a more ""immersive"" TikTok-style viewing experience in May, while Zuckerberg told investors in April that Meta was making significant investments to support the ""discovery engine"" approach. read more

Earlier this month, Chief Product Officer Chris Cox told employees there was a plan to increase fivefold the number of graphic processing units (GPUs) in its data centers by the year-end to provide extra computing power for AI.

235,META,2022-07-29,Meta's Mark Zuckerberg: Company's pandemic-era forecast was too rosy,"[1/2] Facebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies at a House Financial Services Committee hearing in Washington, U.S., October 23, 2019. REUTERS/Erin Scott















July 29 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told staffers the world's biggest social media company had planned for growth too optimistically, mistakenly expecting that a bump in usage and revenue growth during COVID-19 lockdowns would be sustained.

Zuckerberg, responding to an employee question at a company-wide meeting on Thursday, said he had hired too aggressively and failed to account for the possibility of an economic downturn, according to a person who heard the remarks.

The employee had asked about mistakes Zuckerberg had made, the person said.

Meta declined to comment.

The comments were more pointed than those Zuckerberg had delivered during an investor call the prior day, after Facebook-owner Meta recorded its first ever quarterly drop in revenue and forecast another fall to come in the third quarter. read more

On the investor call, Zuckerberg said he believed the economy was entering a downturn that would have a ""broad impact"" on the digital advertising business.

""It's always hard to predict how deep or how long these cycles will be, but I'd say that the situation seems worse than it did a quarter ago,"" he said.

He told investors the company planned to ""steadily reduce headcount growth"" over the next year.

At the company meeting on Thursday, another employee asked Zuckerberg if senior managers at Meta had been ""coasting,"" referencing an ongoing debate over the term since an executive this month told managers to ""move to exit"" any employees who were ""coasting"" or performing poorly.

Zuckerberg responded by discussing Meta's performance reviews generally, according to the person who heard him speak, as well as another briefed on the response.

The employee who raised the question then took to the comments section of an internal discussion board, writing that in his view Zuckerberg had not answered his question.

The exchanges come as Zuckerberg is battling intensifying morale issues at Meta, on top of economic woes and business challenges from Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and ByteDance's TikTok.

At a tense company-wide meeting last month, Zuckerberg told employees he expected them to work with more ""intensity,"" as he cut hiring targets and cranked up performance standards that were relaxed during the pandemic. read more

Meta staffers, who like many tech employees are paid partly in stock units, saw their compensation effectively slashed this year as the stock price tumbled on news of stalling growth.

236,META,2023-01-17,Meta's oversight board calls for more inclusive adult nudity policy,"













Jan 17 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms' (META.O) oversight board on Tuesday overturned the company's decision to remove two Instagram posts depicting transgender and non-binary people with bare chests, saying that Meta needed to change its policy to make it more inclusive.

The board, which is funded by Meta but operates independently, said in a ruling that the company's adult nudity policy is based on a binary view of gender, making it unclear how the rules apply to intersex, non-binary and transgender people.

The cases referred by the board included two posts in 2021 and 2022 made under an Instagram account, which is maintained by a U.S.-based couple. The posts featured images of the couple bare-chested with the nipples covered and their captions discussed transgender healthcare and gender-affirming surgery.

Meta's policy prohibits images containing female nipples other than in specified circumstances such as breastfeeding and gender confirmation surgery.

""The restrictions and exceptions to the rules on female nipples are extensive and confusing, particularly as they apply to transgender and non-binary people,"" the board said.

It added that ""this creates confusion for users and moderators and, as Meta has recognized, leads to content being wrongly removed.""

The oversight board, which includes academics, rights experts and lawyers, was created by the company to rule on a small slice of thorny content moderation appeals, but it can also advise on site policies.

237,META,2022-04-14,"WhatsApp tests new feature to organize groups for work, school","













April 14 (Reuters) - WhatsApp is testing a new feature called Communities to organize groups in larger structures that could be used by workplaces or schools, the messaging service owned by Meta Platforms (FB.O) said on Thursday.

WhatsApp head Will Cathcart said the feature would bring together groups, which are capped at 256 users, under bigger umbrellas where administrators could send alerts to a community of thousands.

""This is really oriented at the communities you're already a part of in your life that are doing private communication,"" said Cathcart in an interview with Reuters, citing Salesforce-owned (CRM.N) Slack or Microsoft Teams (MSFT.O) as comparable types of communication.

He said there were no current plans to charge for the new feature, which is being beta tested with a small number of global communities, but did not rule out offering ""premium features to enterprise"" in the future.

The messaging service, which is end-to-end encrypted and has about 2 billion users, said the Communities feature would also be end-to-end encrypted.

WhatsApp has grappled with abuses including bulk messaging and the spread of misinformation and hate speech. Cathcart said users would not be able to search for different Communities on WhatsApp and that it would use anti-abuse tools and safeguards like forwarding limits for the new feature.

WhatsApp said there would also be changes to its Groups feature before the launch of Communities. It said it was adding the ability for group administrators to remove problematic messages from everyone's chat, introducing voice calling for up to 32 people, increasing file sharing to 2 gigabytes and adding emoji reactions to messages.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a Thursday post that Communities would be rolled out over the coming months. He said Meta would be building community messaging features for Facebook, Messenger and Instagram.

Meta also plans to roll out end-to-end encryption across the other messaging services on its apps as part of its ongoing, declared pivot towards privacy.

238,META,2022-06-02,"Who is Javier Olivan, Meta's next COO?","













June 1 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms (FB.O) veteran Javier Olivan is taking over as the company's chief operating officer after playing a crucial but largely behind-the-scenes role stoking the social media company's explosive growth for 15 years.

The Spaniard will replace Sheryl Sandberg, who announced on Wednesday she was stepping down from Meta.

The move comes as Meta struggles with slowing growth and rising costs. It is transforming from a social media company to one focused on building the metaverse, a collection of virtual worlds that could be a decade away.

Olivan, who grew up in the Pyrenees region of northern Spain, holds degrees in electrical and industrial engineering from the University of Navarra and a master's in business administration from Stanford University.

Before joining Facebook in late 2007 as head of international growth, Olivan, 44, worked at Japan's NTT and Siemens.

When he joined, Facebook was a young company with about 40 million users and now has nearly 3.6 billion users across Facebook and other apps such as Instagram.

While overseeing its international moves, Olivan pushed Facebook's expansion into countries such as India, Japan, Russia, Indonesia and Brazil, according to an interview he gave in 2010 to VentureBeat.

Critics say the company pursued this growth without sufficient safeguards against the spread of misinformation, hate speech or harmful content in emerging markets.

Former Facebook product manager and whistleblower Frances Haugen last year leaked internal documents that she said showed Facebook put profits over user safety and lacked adequate controls to remove harmful content in languages other than English.

Olivan, who according to media reports enjoys paragliding and surfing, has most recently served as chief growth officer. In that position, he has managed features and functions that span Facebook and Instagram as well as messaging apps WhatsApp and Messenger.

In his new job, he will continue to lead infrastructure and corporate development. But his portfolio will also include advertising and business products, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post on Wednesday.

One thing is unlikely to change. Olivan will continue to stay out of the limelight as he carries out the COO job. This contrasts with Sandberg, who appeared before Congress, wrote a best-selling book about women in the workplace and often represented Facebook to outside audiences.

""This role will be different from what Sheryl has done. It will be a more traditional COO role where Javi will be focused internally and operationally, building on his strong track record of making our execution more efficient and rigorous,"" Zuckerberg said.

Now that Meta is a mature business with $118 billion in revenue, Olivan may have less autonomy than Sandberg did when she joined in the company's early years, said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at ad agency GroupM.

A key question is whether Olivan will be ""more attentive,"" to issues regarding data privacy as well as protecting brands from having their ads appear next to unsuitable content, Wieser said.

239,META,2022-09-22,Italy's watchdog asks Facebook for clarification on pre-election activities,"













MILAN, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Italy's Data Protection Agency has asked Facebook to clarify the activities the social media giant has engaged in ahead of Sunday's national elections, it said on Thursday.

Tech giant Meta (META.O), which owns social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, has launched an information campaign targeting potential Italian voters ahead of a parliamentary election called for Sept. 25.

The initiative, which Meta says is aimed at countering interference and removing content that discourages voting, includes collaboration with independent fact-checking organisations and the use of a Virtual Operations Centre to identify potential threats in real-time.

Facebook will have to provide ""detailed information"" on the initiative, on the nature of data processing, as well as on the measures taken to ensure that the initiative is only brought to people who are eighteen or older, the watchdog said.

A Meta spokesperson said that the company's ""Italian election tools have been expressly designed to respect users' privacy and comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)"".

""We are cooperating with the Italian Data Protection Authority to explain how we are working to help protect the integrity of the Italian election and to connect people with reliable election information from the Ministry of Interior"", the spokesperson said.

240,META,2023-03-13,Mark Zuckerberg takes on Elon Musk,"













NEW YORK, March 13 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Mark Zuckerberg is eyeing Elon Musk’s turf. Meta Platforms (META.O) is exploring a stand-alone social network for sharing text updates, according to a statement from the social media network to Breakingviews on Monday. The move makes sense since Facebook and Instagram have done a better job wringing money from their users than Twitter has. Now that the platform owned by Musk is going through severe challenges, it is an even easier land grab.

Since Musk bought Twitter in October 2022, the network has been plagued by technical difficulties and fleeing advertisers. And even during the best of times, Twitter was playing third string to Facebook and Instagram. In the year before it went private, it burned $370 million of cash. Meanwhile in 2021 Meta raked in $38 billion.

Meta’s cash flow has since fallen, but it’s possible that the two companies have diverged even more. Zuckerberg has a business model that knows how to monetize users, whereas Twitter is still figuring that out. In 2021, each one of Meta’s nearly 3 billion daily active users represented over $40 in revenue compared to $16 per Twitter user. Zuckerberg’s Twitter competitor may be in its early stages, but it already has a head start. (By Jennifer Saba)

241,META,2022-10-26,Meta’s spending splurge starts to look troubling,"













NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Meta Platforms’ (META.O) present is indicating problems for the future. The social media company plans to invest nearly a tenth of its $370 billion market capitalization on various projects, including its concentrated bet on the metaverse. Last year, existing operations generated enough cash to justify the spending spree. If results slip – and the third quarter suggests they could – spending will become a problem.

The company said on Wednesday that revenue in the three months ending Sept. 30 fell 4% from a year earlier to about $28 billion, slightly higher than analyst expectations, according to Refinitiv. Profitability is worsening significantly, however. Mark Zuckerberg’s company posted operating income of $5.6 billion, almost half of what it was in the third quarter of 2021, as margins also declined considerably.

Part of the problem is that its core business of selling advertising on apps including Facebook and Instagram is getting stale. Daily active users inched up to almost 2 billion, just 3% higher year-on-year. Ambitions in the metaverse, which allows people to trot around a virtual world as avatars, will take time to produce results. Revenue from the division dubbed “Reality Labs” was a mere $285 million in the latest quarter, about 1% of the company’s total.

Meta expects capital expenditures to be between $32 billion and $33 billion for 2022. Data centers, servers and network infrastructure account for some of it, and a big slug also funds the metaverse initiative. Last year’s $59 billion in operating cash flow underpinned Zuckerberg’s bold initiative. In 2020, cash flow was only a bit higher than the current estimated range. Next year’s number is pegged as high as $39 billion.

The third-quarter top line was less than in the fourth quarter of 2020 while operating income dropped to the lowest level since the three-month period ending in June 2019, suggesting that spending projections may soon outrun cash produced from Meta’s daily businesses. Dialing back capex makes sense, but it would force Zuckerberg to recalibrate the timing, and perhaps the power, of the metaverse.

242,META,2022-10-10,Trustbusters’ metaverse gambit,"













NEW YORK, Oct 10 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Mark Zuckerberg isn’t the only one making risky gambits in the metaverse. On Friday, trustbusters at the Federal Trade Commission pared back their arguments against Meta Platforms’ (META.O) acquisition of virtual reality app maker Within. But even on the remaining, simplified claims, the FTC has a difficult needle to thread.

The agency run by Lina Khan stepped back from initial arguments that Meta’s Beat Saber game competes directly against Within’s Supernatural fitness app. That was always an odd stretching of definitions that both limited the market to a thin slice of virtual reality and at the same time included wildly disparate apps.

Now the FTC is claiming that the deal is anticompetitive because it eliminates the effect of future competition that Meta would introduce were it forced to develop, instead of acquire, its own fitness products. That resembles arguments against the 2015 merger of sterilization companies Steris and Synergy – a case the FTC lost.

It's also an uncomfortable about-face for enforcers. Typically, merging parties claim a hypothetical new entrant could shake things up. The FTC’s expansive antitrust push under Khan already faced challenges. Adopting arguments usually deployed by its foes could risk further blowback. (By Jonathan Guilford)

243,META,2023-02-21,Feuding law firms in Facebook antitrust case told to make peace,"Companies Meta Platforms Inc Follow















(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday appointed two prominent U.S. law firms as co-leaders of consumer claims against Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) Facebook, saying he hoped they would put aside their dispute over control of the antitrust case and work together.

In a court order, U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco appointed Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro and Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan with ""some reservations"" given the past ""rocky relationship"" between the two law firms.

""It is the court's expectation that the attorneys will treat this appointment as the start of a new day, and put behind them the conflicts that gave rise to these proceedings,"" Donato wrote.

The case involves a group of consumers who contend Facebook exploited user data to maintain its market power. The company has denied the claims.

Law firms routinely vie for sole or co-leadership roles in high-profile class actions, since such appointments by judges can help steer cases and earn firms bigger cuts of legal fees.

Hagens Berman partner Shana Scarlett and Quinn Emanuel partner Kevin Teruya, the two lawyers appointed to represent a prospective consumer class, did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

Representatives for Quinn Emanuel and Facebook declined to comment, and a spokesperson for Hagens Berman did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

Scarlett in recent court filings said Quinn Emanuel was not respecting her view as a leading antitrust attorney based on her gender.

Quinn Emanuel denied the claim, saying it has ""worked very hard to be cooperative with all counsel on the case, including female counsel.""

Both firms had been appointed co-counsel in 2021 by a judge who has since been elevated to a U.S. appeals court.

Donato started the appointment process from scratch in January amid quarreling between Seattle-based plaintiffs' firm Hagens Berman and 900-lawyer Quinn Emanuel.

The firms sought individual, sole appointment and not co-leadership.

Donato said in Tuesday's order that the designation of co-leadership was interim and that ""further reports of dysfunctionality or breakdowns in the work relationship"" would likely result in designation of new counsel.

The case is Klein v. Meta Platforms Inc, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 5:20-cv-08570.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid















Oct 5 (Reuters) - A lawsuit filed in San Francisco on Tuesday accuses online gaming firm Roblox Corp (RBLX.N) of enabling a California girl's sexual and financial exploitation by adult men.

The lawsuit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, also targets online chat company Discord Inc, Snapchat parent Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and Instagram parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O). Snap and Meta are already facing dozens of similar lawsuits.

Meta declined to comment. Roblox and Snap could not immediately be reached.

A Discord spokesperson said the company has a “zero-tolerance policy for anyone who endangers or sexualizes children” but declined to comment directly on the lawsuit.

According to the lawsuit, which was seen by Reuters, the girl, S.U., was born in 2009 and began using Roblox when she was nine or ten years old. Roblox is popular with children under 13 but also has adult users.

Starting in early 2020, S.U. came into contact with adult men through Roblox, who encouraged her to sign up for Discord, Snapchat and Instagram to communicate with them, according to the lawsuit. None of the companies required parental consent, and Discord did not verify S.U.'s age even though it said it did not allow users under 13 years old, the lawsuit said.

The men exploited her by encouraging her to drink and abuse prescription drugs and send sexually explicit photos of herself, according to the lawsuit. One man allegedly persuaded her to send him money.

S.U. suffered severe mental health problems leading to suicide attempts and hospitalization as a result of her experience, the lawsuit said.

S.U. and her mother, C.U., claim the companies failed to take steps to keep minors using their platforms safe, and that Snap and Instagram encouraged addiction in children. They are seeking unspecified damages.

245,META,2022-05-24,Alicia Vikander tackles fame and fears in ‘Irma Vep’ TV series remake,"













CANNES, May 24 (Reuters) - Oscar-winner Alicia Vikander said her latest leading role allowed her to draw from her own experiences as an actor.

The Swedish actress plays the title role in ""Irma Vep"" a HBO mini-series remake of Olivier Assayas's 1996 cult film of the same name.

The eight-episode show centres on American movie star Mira, who, hoping to give her blockbuster film career a new direction and recover from a recent breakup, travels to Paris to star in an arthouse remake of the French silent movie ""Les Vampires"". As the film set slowly descends into chaos, so does Mira's state of mind.

The role was originally played by Hong Kong actor Maggie Cheung, who starred as herself in the 1996 movie.

""I don't play myself, I play Mira. But in our series she is anxious because her part has already been played by an Asian actress. So I got to meta, meta, meta play that in layers and actually express my own anxiety over remaking something that already a very extraordinary actor has done,"" Vikander told Reuters in Cannes where she launched the series with Assayas and its cast.

Like the film, the series examines the challenges of film-making and production, and the many, often absurd, aspects of fame.

Scenes show Mira being mobbed by fans as she is chauffeured around for promotional events, fittings and meetings.

""You get to kind of pull back the curtain and get introduced to what this world can look like behind the scenes and the silliness, the craziness, the stress,"" said Vikander of the screenplay written by Assayas.

""It's been nice to have someone point out the things that are pretty strange, things that you see all the time but when he puts it down to paper, I'm like, yeah, I know, that's pretty out there and quite funny.""

""Irma Vep"", which was presented out of competition at Cannes, debuts on HBO on June 6.

246,META,2022-05-17,Russia says it's not planning to block YouTube or cut itself off from internet,"













May 17 (Reuters) - Russia is not planning to block Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) YouTube, the minister for digital development said on Tuesday, acknowledging that such a move would likely see Russian users suffer and should therefore be avoided.

Russia has blocked other foreign social media platforms, but despite months of fines and threats against YouTube for failing to delete content Moscow deems illegal and for restricting access to some Russian media, it has stopped short of delivering a killer blow to the video-hosting service.

With around 90 million monthly users in Russia, YouTube is extremely popular and plays an important role in the digital economy. Though Russia has domestic versions of other social media, a viable YouTube alternative on that scale is yet to emerge. read more

""We are not planning to close YouTube,"" Maksut Shadaev, who is also minister of communications and mass media, told an educational forum. ""Above all, when we restrict something, we should clearly understand that our users won't suffer.""

Competition is the engine of progress and blocking is an extreme measure, he told a vast auditorium of mostly young Russians, some scattered around the room on bean bags.

Alphabet's Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Simmering tensions between Moscow and Big Tech erupted into a full-on information battle after Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Russia restricted access to Twitter (TWTR.N) and Meta Platform's (FB.O) Facebook and Instagram in early March. It vowed in April to punish Google for shutting out Russian state-funded media globally on YouTube, accusing it of spreading fakes about what Russia calls its special military operation in Ukraine. read more

Meta was found guilty of ""extremist activity"" in March, a ruling the company objected to, but Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday said he would not rule out the return of Instagram, provided Meta complies with Russian laws on content and local offices.

GLOBAL INTERNET TO STAY

Shadaev also poured cold water on suggestions that Russia may seek to isolate itself further from global internet infrastructure, something it disconnected itself from during tests last summer.

""We do not want to close ourselves off from anyone,"" Shadaev said. ""On the contrary, we think that Russia should remain a part of the global network.""

247,META,2022-12-20,Facebook held back on naming Cambridge Analytica in 2017 -deposition,"













OAKLAND, Calif., Dec 19 (Reuters) - Mark Zuckerberg considered saying in a 2017 speech that Facebook was looking into ""organizations like Cambridge Analytica,"" according to details from a deposition of him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

But he decided to remove reference to the political consultancy which harvested data on millions of Facebook users ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a previously unreported move that could add fuel to shareholder allegations that Zuckerberg and other executives hid information from the public about one of its biggest privacy scandals.

When Meta executives learned of issues related to Cambridge Analytica, and how they responded, is central to lawsuits in California and Delaware in which shareholders allege the executives breached fiduciary duties and consumers allege mishandling of their private information.

Attorneys for both sets of plaintiffs declined to comment.

Facebook, now organized as Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), ordered Cambridge Analytica in 2015 to delete inappropriately gathered user information and has said that it considered the matter resolved until March 2018 when new concerns emerged.

Zuckerberg, Meta's chief executive, reiterated that timeline and noted he was advised against naming organizations in the speech, according to the transcript of the February 2019 deposition which Reuters obtained this month through a public records request.

Portions are redacted, leaving unclear why Zuckerberg proposed referencing Cambridge six months before the additional accusations about it. Zuckerberg in the deposition also acknowledges asking colleagues in January 2017 to assess Cambridge's claims about its influence in elections.

Meta declined to comment on the removed reference beside saying its case with the SEC had been settled for over three years.

Media reports in March 2018 suggested that Cambridge kept leveraging Facebook data, prompting government investigations related to data protection practices that Facebook settled in the United States for at least $5.1 billion.

The SEC as part of its settled probe had asked Zuckerberg in the deposition about a draft speech he wrote about Russia possibly interfering in the 2016 election by abusing Facebook services.

In the draft obtained by the SEC, Zuckerberg proposed saying: ""We are already looking into foreign actors including Russian intelligence, actors in other former Soviet states and organizations like Cambridge Analytica.""

Transcripts of his livestreamed remarks show he said: ""We are looking into foreign actors, including additional Russian groups and other former Soviet states, as well as organizations like the campaigns.""

Zamaan Qureshi, policy advisor for consumer advocacy group The Real Facebook Oversight Board, said the deposition should increase users' doubts of Meta.

248,META,2022-10-31,Instagram fixes bug that triggered hours-long outage,"













Oct 31 (Reuters) - Instagram said on Monday it had fixed a software bug that prevented thousands of users from accessing the photo-sharing platform for about eight hours and led to complaints of accounts being suspended.

""We've resolved this bug now - it was causing people in different parts of the world to have issues accessing their accounts and caused a temporary change for some in number of followers,"" Meta Platforms Inc (META.O)-owned Instagram said in a tweet on Monday.

A spokesperson for Instagram did not comment on suspension of accounts. Several Instagram users had tweeted that they were asked for email IDs and phone numbers to access their suspended account.

From over 7,500 reports at 10:09 ET on outage-tracking website Downdetector, the number of user reports declined to nearly 500 around 6 PM ET.

Downdetector collates status reports from a number of sources including user-submitted errors on its platform. The outage may be affecting a much larger number of users. Shares of Meta closed down 6.1% amid a wider selloff in stock markets.

249,META,2022-06-23,Instagram tests new tools for age verification,"













June 23 (Reuters) - Instagram said on Thursday it is testing new options for users to verify their age on the platform, starting with people in the United States.

The photo-sharing service owned by Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) said it is testing two new ways to verify a person's age, in addition to allowing them to upload their identity proof online.

""When we know if someone is a teen (13-17 years), we provide them with age-appropriate experiences like defaulting them into private accounts, preventing unwanted contact from adults they don't know and limiting the options advertisers have to reach them with ads,"" Erica Finkle, director of data governance at Meta, said in a blog post.

Instagram said it has partnered with Yoti, a company that specializes in online age verification to ensure users' privacy.

Users can upload a video selfie to verify their age, after which Yoti's technology estimates their age based on facial features. Both Meta and Yoti will delete the image once the age has been verified, Instagram said.

Another option is for people to select three mutual followers to confirm the user's age, and the person vouching must be at least 18 years old.

The move comes after Instagram paused the launch of Instagram Kids last year, after receiving criticism and opposition for the project.

Instagram Kids was touted as requiring parental permission to join, and was supposed to provide ad-free, age-appropriate content, but U.S. lawmakers and advocacy groups urged the company to drop its launch plans, citing safety concerns. read more

PARIS, May 4 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc's (FB.O) chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, on Wednesday teased a new smart glasses project with EssilorLuxottica (ESLX.PA), posting a photo of the eyewear company's chairman sporting a prototype of a neural interface wristband - designed for directing other devices.

""Here Leonardo is using a prototype of our neural interface EMG [electromyography] wristband that will eventually let you control your glasses and other devices,"" Zuckerberg said in a post on Facebook, referring to EssilorLuxottica's chairman, Leonardo Del Vecchio. He closed his message with a smiley-face emoji wearing sunglasses.

Facebook - which changed its name to Meta Platforms in October - said in a blog post last year that it planned to develop a wristband that would control augmented reality glasses, allowing users to interact with a virtual world using finger movements.

Zuckerberg was in Milan to discuss plans for new smart glasses with the eyewear company, he said.

Tech companies Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google have piled in to the wearable tech business, developing augmented reality glasses in a bet they could one day replace mobile phones. Google also embraced fitness tracking technology by acquiring Fitbit for $2.1 billion.

In 2020, EssilorLuxottica and Meta Platforms announced a multiyear collaboration to develop smart glasses. They currently sell frames like the classic Ray-Ban Wayfarer model that are embedded with technology, allowing the wearer to take photos and listen to music and calls, starting at $299.

251,META,2023-01-09,Meta's Oversight Board tells company to allow 'death to Khamenei' posts,"













Jan 9 (Reuters) - Meta's (META.O) Oversight Board on Monday overturned the company's decision to remove a Facebook post that used the slogan ""death to Khamenei"" to criticize the Iranian leader, saying it did not violate a rule barring violent threats.

The board, which is funded by Meta but operates independently, said in a ruling that the phrase is often used to mean ""down with Khamenei"" in referring to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been leading a violent crackdown on nationwide protests in recent months.

It also urged the company to develop better ways of factoring such context into its content policies and outline clearly when rhetorical threats against heads of state were permitted.

""In the context of the post, and the broader social, political and linguistic situation in Iran, 'marg bar Khamenei' should be understood as 'down with.' It is a rhetorical, political slogan, not a credible threat,"" the board wrote.

Iran has been gripped by demonstrations since mid-September, following the death in detention of a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman arrested for wearing ""inappropriate attire"" under the country's strict dress code for women.

The protests, in which demonstrators from all walks of life have called for the fall of Iran's ruling theocracy, have posed one of the biggest challenges to the government of the Shi'ite Muslim-ruled Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution.

The unrest created a now-familiar conundrum for Meta, which has wavered repeatedly in its treatment of violent political rhetoric on its platforms.

The company bans language that incites ""serious violence"" but aims to avoid overreach by limiting enforcement to credible threats, leaving ambiguity around when and how the rule applies.

After Russia invaded Ukraine last year, for example, Meta introduced a temporary exemption to allow calls for death to Russian President Vladimir Putin, aiming to give users in the region space to express their anger over the war.

However, days later it reversed the exemption after Reuters reported its existence.

Meta also has faced scrutiny over how its platforms were used to organize in the run-up to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Phrases like ""kill them all"" appeared in thousands of U.S.-based Facebook Groups before the attack, including calls for violence against specific U.S. political leaders.

The Oversight Board said in its ruling that ""death to Khamenei"" statements differed from threats posted around Jan. 6, as politicians were then ""clearly at risk"" in the U.S. context and ""death to"" was not a rhetorical statement in English.

Oct 28 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) said on Friday it has fixed the issue that was preventing users from accessing its social media platforms.

""Earlier today, a configuration change caused some people to have trouble accessing our products,"" a Meta spokesperson said.

More than 11,000 users across Instagram, Facebook and Messenger had reported issues with accessing the apps, sending messages and logging into their accounts, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com.

Meta's messaging app WhatsApp had faced a global outage just earlier this week, which was later resolved.

Downdetector tracks outages by collating status reports from several sources including user-submitted errors on its platform. The outage may be affecting a larger number of users.

WASHINGTON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee will hold a hearing Wednesday with Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META.O), Alphabet's YouTube (GOOGL.O), Twitter (TWTR.N) and short video app TikTok on social media's impact on homeland security.

The panel led by Democratic Senator Gary Peters will also hear from a panel of former executives including from Twitter and Facebook.

The committee said the hearing will be an opportunity ""to understand the extent to which social media companies’ business models, through algorithms, targeted advertising, and other operations and practices, contribute to the amplification of harmful content and other threats to homeland security.""

The company officials testifying including Meta

Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, YouTube Chief Product Officer Neal Mohan, TikTok Chief Operating Officer Vanessa Pappas and Twitter General Manager of Bluebird Jay Sullivan.

This will be the 31st time a Facebook or Meta executive has testified before Congress in the last 5 years.

Last year, Peters pressed social media firms for more information regarding their companies’ policies to monitor and remove extremist and conspiracy content that advocates violence.

Peters has reviewed how social media platforms amplify what he termed ""domestic extremist content.

""In attack after attack, there are signs that social media platforms played a role in exposing people to increasingly extreme content, and even amplifying dangerous content to more users,"" Peters said at a 2021 hearing.

July 22 (Reuters) - Shares of social media firms fell sharply on Friday after Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Snapchat's owner signaled advertisers had tightened their purse strings in response to a darkening economic outlook.

Pinterest Inc plunged 11.3%, Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) dropped 5.6%, Google-owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), which also sells ads online, fell 3.3%.

At current prices Pinterest, Meta, Twitter, Alphabet and Snap were collectively set to lose about $42 billion in market value.

Twitter also blamed its ongoing battle to close its $44-billion acquisition by Elon Musk for the surprise fall in quarterly revenue. The micro-blogging site's shares were down 0.1% in choppy trading. read more

""If you want proof that companies are nervous about the economic outlook, just look at how media platforms and marketing agencies are bemoaning a tougher advertising market,"" Russ Mould, AJ Bell investment director, said.

Investors are bracing for the slowest global revenue growth in the history of the social media sector as Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) privacy changes further cloud outlook. read more

Snap Inc's shares were down 36.4% and were the most heavily traded across U.S. exchanges, as the company said it was looking for new sources of revenue to grow.

""Unfortunately for Snap and the digital ad sector, we believe there are signs of further ad spending cuts,"" RBC Capital Markets said in a note.

Attention now turns to quarterly reports from mega-cap firms Meta and Alphabet next week. Some analysts believe the drop in their share prices reflects what is likely to be a subdued report.

""While more revenue cuts for advertising stocks are likely, we think Alphabet has more relative revenue stability given breadth of advertisers, more expense flexibility than most peers,"" analysts at Bank of American Global Research said.

BRUSSELS, March 6 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms' (META.O) WhatsApp has agreed to be more transparent about changes to its privacy policy introduced in 2021, the European Commission said on Monday, following complaints from consumer bodies across Europe.

The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) and the European Network of consumer authorities told WhatsApp last year that it had not clarified the changes in plain and intelligible language, violating the bloc's laws.

EU members' national regulators can sanction companies for breaches.

WhatsApp has now agreed to explain changes to EU users' contracts and how these could affect their rights, and has agreed to display prominently the possibility for users to accept or reject the changes and ensure that users can easily close pop-up notifications on updates.

The company also confirmed that users' personal data is not shared with third parties or other Meta companies, including Facebook, for advertising purposes.

""Consumers have a right to understand what they agree to and what that choice entails concretely, so that they can decide whether they want to continue using the platform,"" Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said.

The messaging service owned by Meta Platforms (FB.O) said on Thursday that it is testing the new tool to organize groups in larger structures that could be used by workplaces or schools.

The feature would bring together groups, which at present are capped at 256 users.

NEW DELHI, Oct 29 (Reuters) - India continues to favour a self-regulatory body for social media content disputes, a federal minister told Reuters, despite a lack of consensus among Big Tech companies to form a joint appeals panel.

The government on Friday said it would set up an appeals panel amid concerns users had no recourse if they objected to moderation decisions of firms such as Meta (META.O), Twitter (TWTR.N) or Google (GOOGL.O).

The move is seen as the latest attempt of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration to regulate Big Tech firms through policy changes that have often irked companies who complain about excessive compliance burden.

News of the panel came after New Delhi said in June it could scrap the proposal if the companies themselves banded together to form a self-regulatory body. But they failed to reach a consensus -- Google was opposed to external reviews, as Reuters reported in August, while Meta and Twitter favoured self-regulation fearing government overreach.

India's Minister of State for IT, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, told Reuters in an interview on Saturday New Delhi could still consider industry self-regulation as government-led reviews ""is not something that we want to spend a lot of time doing"".

He added, however, that such a body ""cannot be a cozy club of industry people"" and should have consumer and government representation.

Meta, Twitter and Google did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

Decisions about social media content have been a particularly thorny issue in India.

During a press briefing on Saturday, Chandrasekhar said the current system of in-house grievance redressal at tech companies was ""broken"".

Twitter has faced a backlash in the past after it blocked accounts of influential Indians, including politicians, citing violation of its policies. It also locked horns with the Indian government last year when it declined to comply fully with orders to take down accounts the government said spread misinformation.

The government panel ""is a signal to them (social media firms) that they need to up their game,"" Chandrasekhar told Reuters.

NEW DELHI, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The IT head of India's ruling party said on Thursday he will sue the Wire for damaging his reputation, weeks after the local media portal stated in a story it later retracted that Instagram took down, without review, any posts that he had flagged.

""Not only will I be setting the criminal process in motion but I will also sue them in a civil court seeking damages as they forged documents with a view to malign and tarnish my reputation,"" the Bharatiya Janata Party's Amit Malviya tweeted.

Instagram parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

""Technological evidence is more complicated and the usual due diligence may not always reveal the fraud perpetrated upon a publication. This is what happened to us,"" the Wire said in a statement to Reuters.

Malviya's planned legal action comes after the U.S. social media company and the Wire engaged in a public feud in recent weeks over the news report and subsequent reporting from the outlet to support its story.

Meta in press statements previously called Wire's reporting inaccurate and based on documents it believed were ""fabricated."" The Wire retracted all the stories last week and published an apology to readers on Thursday, saying the reports in question about Meta did not meet its standards.

""To have rushed to publish a story we believed was reliable without having the associated technical evidence vetted independently is a failure of which we cannot permit repetition,"" the publication said.

In its statement following Malviya's tweet, Wire added: ""Whether the person who brought all the material to The Wire deceived us at anyone else's behest or acted on his own is a matter that will be subjected to judicial process in due course.""

Aug 17 (Reuters) - TikTok will work to prevent content creators from posting paid political messages on the short-form video app, as part of its preparation for the U.S. midterm election in November, the company said on Wednesday.

Critics and lawmakers accuse TikTok and rival social media companies including Meta Platforms (META.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N) of doing too little to stop political misinformation and divisive content from spreading on their apps. read more

While TikTok has banned paid political ads since 2019, campaign strategists have skirted the ban by paying influencers to promote political issues. [nL1N2HH1NQ

The company seeks to close the loophole by hosting briefings with creators and talent agencies to remind them that posting paid political content is against TikTok's policies, said Eric Han, TikTok's head of U.S. safety, during a briefing with reporters.

He added that internal teams, including those that work on trust and safety, will monitor for signs that creators are being paid to post political content, and the company will also rely on media reports and outside partners to find violating posts.

""We saw this as an issue in 2020,"" Han said. ""Once we find out about it ... we will remove it from our platform.""

TikTok broadcast its plan following similar updates from Meta and Twitter.

Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said Tuesday it will restrict political advertisers from running new ads a week before the election, an action it also took in 2020.

Last week, Twitter said it planned to revive previous strategies for the midterm election, including placing labels in front of some misleading tweets and inserting reliable information into timelines to debunk false claims before they spread further online. Civil and voting rights experts said the plan was not adequate to prepare for the election. read more

260,META,2022-11-08,Tech firms can’t swing the axe equally,"













NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Technology giants are used to wielding power and influence. Now comes the axe. From Meta Platforms (META.O) to Snap (SNAP.N) to Twitter there is a realization that the size of the workforce has gotten too big as an economic slump settles in. Some companies need more of a reset. But mass layoffs in other industries suggests that firms should be careful not to over-fire.

Mark Zuckerberg’s $253 billion outfit is preparing to slash thousands of workers this week, according to the Wall Street Journal. Twitter’s new owner Elon Musk is blaming a massive drop in revenue as the reason to cull half of the social network’s 7,500 employees. Snap plans to chop 20% of its headcount after disappointing results. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) wants to keep a lid on costs and is eyeing slashing payrolls. Even Amazon.com (AMZN.O), which has weathered the dot-com bust and the great recession, is hitting the pause button on hiring.

One fairly simple way to measure productivity is to calculate how much revenue a company earns per employee. For example, Meta increased its revenue 37% last year compared to 2020, to $118 billion, though its workforce jumped by nearly a quarter to nearly 72,000. Each of those employees represented $1.6 million in revenue – the highest amount in a five-year stretch. Twitter, conversely, hit its zenith in 2018. Even then, though, each employee represented $776,000, well under what Zuckerberg managed to extract last year.

So Twitter can afford to lose far more employees based on that metric. But there are risks associated with chopping the workforce. While it saves on labor costs, fewer people mean a lack of new products too, according to a study from the Society for Human Resources Management. For the tech business, that’s especially problematic. Their lifeblood, unlike a utility company, is innovation.

These tech firms, though established, are also largely untested through a downturn. But other industries are a cautionary tale. Take airlines, which slashed roughly 90,000 jobs in 2020, to levels not seen since the 1980s. Delta Air Lines (DAL.N), American Airlines (AAL.O) and their rivals were caught flat-footed without enough staff when travel rebounded. The investment banking business is notorious for its ruthless firing practices, only to turn around and rapidly overpay for junior analysts when the market returns.

Advertising will snap back and tech giants want to be prepared. Zuckerberg, if he fires too quickly, could lose the edge in employee efficiency. Even Musk, who is in a different boat, was so hasty cutting staff on Friday that managers had to ask dozens to return, according to Bloomberg on Monday. Being mean and lean may sacrifice future growth.

261,META,2022-04-27,TikTok is eating Facebook from the inside,"













WASHINGTON, April 27 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Last year, Facebook had a TikTok problem. This year, it has several. The Chinese-owned video app is eating Mark Zuckerberg’s social network from the inside, first by luring its users and now by challenging Facebook as a news source too. One way that’s showing up is in slowing revenue and barely-there user growth. If Zuckerberg wants to beat TikTok, he’ll have to quickly copy it.

Meta Platforms (FB.O), Facebook’s parent company, said on Wednesday that revenue grew 7% year-on-year, the slowest pace in about a decade. Facebook’s daily active users grew less than 2% from the end of 2021. The shares rose 15% in after-hours trading, but that’s because much damage had already been done. Meta took a beating read more in February when it partly blamed TikTok for Facebook’s first quarterly decline in user growth. The stock is still down about 40% this year, double the fall in the Nasdaq 100 index.

TikTok, being privately held, doesn’t disclose such numbers – but they’re likely to be heading in the opposite direction. It had almost 1.6 billion global monthly active users in the first quarter, less than Facebook’s 2.9 billion but roughly a 45% jump from a year ago, according to Data.ai.

One reason is content. Its videos are compelling enough that TikTok viewers send content creators quasi-cash gifts. In the first quarter, users doled out more than $840 million on TikTok, a record for any app or game, Data.ai reckons. In the fourth quarter of 2021, it was the first app to surpass games like ""World of Warcraft"" and ""Genshin Impact"" in terms of consumer spending.

A new threat is news. Last September, Zuckerberg’s network was a regular news source for 31% of Americans versus just 6% for TikTok, according to a Pew Research Center report. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February – which brought TikTok a host of user footage from that country – changed that dynamic. Views of #Ukraine-tagged posts grew from 6.4 billion on Feb. 20 to currently about 40 billion, according to TikTok. In March, the White House briefed about 30 app influencers about the war.

Facebook has already been trying to ape its upstart rival. Its own video feed, Reels, launched last September. It may have to go faster. About 37% of monthly active Facebook users are also on TikTok, and it’s 51% for Meta’s photo-sharing app Instagram, according to Cowen research. Imitation isn’t flattery – it’s self defense.

262,META,2022-10-27,Zuckerberg motivates supervoting stock resistance,"













NEW YORK, Oct 27 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Mark Zuckerberg is providing fresh motivation for investors everywhere. The Facebook founder’s unwavering commitment to keep investing in the metaverse as his company’s mainstay social-media businesses suffer sent shares in Meta Platforms (META.O) tumbling more than 20% on Thursday. It has now vaporized more than $600 billion in market value this year. If there was ever a time for shareholders to rally against the sort of dual-class structures that surrender control to entrepreneurs, Zuckerberg has provided the ammunition.

When Facebook went public a decade ago, it had more than enough believers to grant the Harvard University dropout an iron grip on his dorm-room creation. At the time of the stock sale, Zuckerberg commanded 57% of the vote with just a 28% economic stake, subjugating other owners with supervoting shares that carry 10 votes apiece. The capitulation paid off, until it didn’t.

Zuckerberg and his second-class shareholders no longer see eye-to-eye on the strategy. Meta feels the need to reinvent itself, changing its name last year to reflect the new ambitions. As operating profit nearly halved in the third quarter, the company said on Wednesday that it would keep investing more than $100 million a day, most of it on virtual reality initiatives. Back in the real world, plummeting shares will demoralize existing staff and prospective recruits. The only way for unhappy investors to express displeasure is to sell.

Meta reckons its board is sufficiently independent to keep watch over Zuckerberg, despite his codified influence over it. His sway also inspired imitators across Silicon Valley. Since 2012, the proportion of technology companies going public with dual-class shares has rocketed from 15% to 46%, according to research out of the University of Florida. Amazon.com (AMZN.O) founder Jeff Bezos and Tesla (TSLA.O) boss Elon Musk are now outliers for not demanding feudal levels of control.

Investors have shown signs of resistance. Some index providers exclude companies with multiple classes of shares. The broad selloff in tech stocks this year, however, should give money managers greater negotiating leverage when the next wave of initial public offerings rolls around.

Even if prospective buyers are supportive of a startup and its leader, Zuckerberg is a reminder this won’t necessarily always be the case. Rejecting supervoting stock would be the best option. Failing that, investors could insist on sunset clauses that phase out the special powers over, say, a decade. Some bosses have found ways to weasel out of those provisions. But insisting on an end date would begin to redress the balance between entrepreneurs and providers of capital.

263,META,2022-07-21,Snap's report incinerates $80 billion in ad industry market cap,"













July 21 (Reuters) - Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (META.O), Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and other companies that sell online ads lost about $80 billion in combined stock market value on Thursday after Snap (SNAP.N) posted poor quarterly results and warned of an uncertain outlook.

Slammed by a weakening economy, increased competition from TikTok and recent privacy changes on iPhones, the Snapchat owner missed second-quarter revenue targets and warned that ""forward-looking visibility remains incredibly challenging.""

Its shares collapsed 26%, bringing Snap's loss in 2022 to over 70%.

With Wall Street already worried about a potential recession, Snap's report also sparked a selloff in rival internet ad sellers. Meta dropped 5% in extended trade, while Alphabet fell 3% and Pinterest tumbled 7%.

Twitter's (TWTR.N) shares fell less, losing just under 2%.

The drop in Alphabet's shares cut its market capitalization by over $40 billion, and Meta's loss reduced its market capitalization by about $25 billion. The drop in Snap's shares evaporated $7 billion of its value.

Snap's poor report also hit other growth stocks, with Spotify Technology (SPOT.N), Shopify and Roblox (RBLX.N) down around 3% each after hours.

With Twitter suing Elon Musk to force the billionaire to make good on his April promise to buy Twitter for $44 billion, many investors view Twitter's stock as a wager on the outcome of that upcoming legal battle, and less as a reflection of the company's current fundamentals.

Twitter is set to report its quarterly results early on Friday, but the micro-blogging platform has canceled its traditional call with analysts, pointing to Musk's ""pending acquisition"".

In its report, Snap said its daily active users rose 18% year-over-year to 347 million, beating analysts' expectations. read more

But that user growth comes as the customers of social media companies face inflation at 40-year highs and brace for a potential economic downturn, an environment where brands spend less on advertising and apply greater scrutiny to how they spend their advertising dollars. read more

Alphabet posts its second-quarter results on July 26, Meta reports on results on July 27, and Pinterest on Aug. 1.

Lawsuit part of wave of failed claims over presidential race















(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday upheld nearly $187,000 in monetary sanctions against two lawyers who filed and lost an ""utterly baseless"" lawsuit challenging Democrat Joe Biden's 2020 presidential win over his Republican rival Donald Trump.

The unanimous ruling by a three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Colorado said Denver attorneys Gary Fielder and Ernest Walker must pay the legal fees of election equipment maker Dominion Voting Systems Inc, Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc and other defendants accused in the lawsuit of meddling in the election.

The Denver-based appeals court affirmed the sanction based on the ""inherent power"" of judges and also a federal law that says a lawyer can be liable for costs for ""unreasonably and vexatiously"" extending a court case.

""An attorney is expected to exercise judgment, and must 'regularly re-evaluate the merits' of claims and 'avoid prolonging meritless claims,'"" 10th Circuit Chief Judge Jerome Holmes, sitting with Circuit Judges Timothy Tymkovich and Veronica Rossman, wrote in their unsigned order. The panel called the legal arguments underpinning the case ""utterly baseless.""

The lawsuit was part of a wave of failed efforts contesting the 2020 election.

In some cases, parties sought sanctions against the lawyers who filed election lawsuits, and in other instances judges acted on their own to sanction attorneys. Attorney licensing officials in Washington, D.C., Texas and elsewhere have opened ethics investigations against some lawyers who pursued election claims backing Trump's meritless assertion that Biden stole victory from him.

In a statement on Tuesday, Fielder said ""never did we think that our actions were unethical or frivolous."" He said ""affirmation of sanctions imposed against us will have a chilling effect on other lawyers"" in future cases.

Fielder said he and Walker will ask the 10th Circuit to rehear their dispute and will turn to the U.S. Supreme Court ""if necessary.""

Regarding Tuesday's ruling, Stanley Garnett, a lawyer for Dominion Voting at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, said that ""Dominion hopes that such orders will deter lawyers from filing similarly frivolous litigation in the future.""

Attorneys for Meta at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Representatives from Dominion and Meta also did not immediately reply to messages seeking comment.

The court's order said Dominion Voting was entitled to about $62,900, and Meta would receive about $50,000.

Other defendants who will be paid fees include state officials in Michigan and Pennsylvania, in addition to the Center for Tech and Civic Life.

The case is O'Rourke v. Dominion Voting Systems Inc, 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-1442.

For plaintiffs: Gary Fielder of Law Office of Gary Fielder, and Ernest Walker of Ernest J. Walker Law Office.

For Dominion: Stanley Garnett of Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck

265,META,2022-10-13,Facebook parent seeks dismissal of U.S. challenge to Within Unlimited deal,"













WASHINGTON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) on Thursday asked a U.S. judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that argues that the company's proposed deal to buy reality content maker Within Unlimited should be blocked.

""The FTC's attempt to fix its ill-conceived complaint still ignores the facts and the law and relies on pure speculation of a hypothetical future state,"" a Meta spokesperson said Thursday.

The FTC, which did not immediately comment, had filed a lawsuit in July saying that Meta's acquisition of Within would ""tend to create a monopoly"" in the market for virtual reality-dedicated fitness apps. read more

The FTC, which filed an amended complaint earlier this month, is focused on the virtual reality dedicated exercise app market and Within's Supernatural, which is available only on Meta's VR devices.

It argues that the proposed deal would ""substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly"" in that market.

Meta's motion said ""the FTC’s conclusory, speculative, and contradictory allegations do not plausibly plead any facts to establish that any supposed market for VR Deliberate Fitness apps is 'oligopolistic' as to either behavior or structure.""

Jan 18 (Reuters) - Keen to buttress margins and appease investor concerns at a time of slowing sales growth, big U.S. technology firms are expected to whittle away at their bloated workforce and costs through the next few months, reversing pandemic-era excesses, analysts said.

Each of America's five largest tech companies, though, are expected to report a fall in profits for the October-December period, as they try to recalibrate in a high-interest environment. Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) are expected to report the biggest declines.

Analysts have cut their total revenue projection for the five companies - Meta, Amazon, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) - by 5% to $561.4 billion as of January from October.

Big tech companies are expected to be among the biggest drags to S&P 500's eleven sectors, with the information technology sector projected to report an earnings decline of 9.5%, according to FactSet data.

""I would not expect good news for a while ... at least for the next three quarters. I would expect more layoffs,"" said Siddharth Singhai, chief investment officer at investment firm Ironhold Capital.

Amazon, which is expected to report that earnings slumped 38% and revenue grew at the slowest pace in over 22 years, started communicating to staff on Wednesday whether they were laid off as part of its decision to cut 18,000 jobs.

The reduction in workforce came after the retailer overhired based on pandemic demand, echoing Meta's aggressive hiring to meet a surge in social media usage by stuck-at-home consumers.

Meta, which decided in November to chop 11,000 jobs, could see a 42% plunge in profit, its fifth straight quarter of decline. The company is also likely to see a 7% fall in revenue - its worst showing ever.

The five companies on an average increased their employee base by 45% in 2020 and 20.5% in 2021, with Apple hiring the most modestly.

""We are forecasting another 5% to 10% headcount cut across the tech sector as many of these companies were spending money like 1980s rockstars,"" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.

Microsoft said on Wednesday it would eliminate 10,000 roles, affecting less than 5% of its employees. Analysts expect the company to report a 2.4% rise in revenue, the slowest pace in about 24 quarters. Profit is expected to fall 9%.

Reuters Graphics

Apple's revenue is expected to fall for the first time in 15 quarters as its major supplier Foxconn (2317.TW) faced major disruption at the biggest iPhone factory in China due to worker unrest related to COVID curbs.

Revenue growth at Alphabet, which is slowing hiring and making ""course corrections"" to cut costs, is expected to be the slowest in 10 quarters.

To shore up stock prices, analysts said these companies could pour money into buybacks this year. Their shares fell between 26% and over 60% last year versus the broader market's nearly 20% decline.

They together have cash and cash equivalents of over $110 billion, with Amazon having the most and Meta having the least at the end of the September quarter.

SAO PAULO, March 2 (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank on Thursday approved Meta Platforms' (META.O) payments launch for small and medium-sized business in Brazil via its messaging application WhatsApp, building on the app's existing local peer-to-peer payment system.

The approval comes as Meta seeks to use the Brazilian market as a key test space for business messaging, an area that has assumed greater urgency as Meta's core advertising business has stalled.

WhatsApp users in Brazil have been able to make payments between users through the application since 2021, but the new development clears the way for merchants to receive payments.

""Soon, WhatsApp users will be able to pay for products and services directly in a conversation with Mastercard and Visa debit and credit cards,"" Guilherme Horn, head of WhatsApp Latin America, said in a Linkedin post.

Shortly after the central bank's greenlight, Meta's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said on his Instagram broadcast channel that ""people will be able to pay small businesses right on WhatsApp"".

""Excited to roll this out soon,"" he said.

Oct 19 (Reuters) - When Snap Inc (SNAP.N) kicks off the third-quarter earnings season for tech and social media companies on Thursday, investors are expecting modest revenue growth across most of the sector as results will be compared with a difficult 2021 when Apple Inc (AAPL.O) privacy changes began to upend the advertising industry.

But a possible recession next year makes forecasting 2023 financials a guess at best, say some analysts, while investors are wary of reading too deeply into ""signs of life"" like ad spending around the fall shopping season as indicators of future performance.

The challenging outlook follows a period in which record-high inflation and global geopolitical uncertainty from the war in Ukraine and U.S.-China tensions have led companies to slash marketing budgets. This has hurt tech platforms that earn the bulk of revenue by selling digital ads and has led to cost-cutting to preserve profitability.

""Overall, we believe the online ad environment remains choppy, with continued volatility week by week,"" JP Morgan analysts wrote in a note to clients on Oct. 4.

Tech companies have taken steps to prepare for the worst through cost cuts, halting hiring, reining in employee perks and focusing on profitable projects. That has helped reassure Wall Street in the short term, some analysts said.

On Thursday, Snap is expected to report 6% growth in revenue to $1.13 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. This would represent the slowest-ever quarterly revenue growth for Snap as a public company.

The Snapchat owner is often the first to report quarterly earnings and serves as a bellwether for the social media sector. Snap shares are down 77% so far this year.

The company announced in August that it would lay off 20% of its staff and cut money-losing projects, blaming a deteriorating economy. read more

Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, the world's largest digital ad platform by market share, has fared relatively well due to the necessity of Google Search ads for brands.

Its wealth of data for advertising and reliance on search-based ads have shielded the company from the impact of privacy changes that Apple introduced last year on iPhones, which made it more difficult for platforms and brands to collect user data for personalized ads.

Wall Street is expecting Alphabet to report the highest growth of the Big Tech companies with an increase of 7.5% in ad revenue compared with last year.

CHALLENGES AHEAD

Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) has been hurt by those changes, on the other hand, and investors will be scrutinizing the company's results for evidence of improving user engagement with Facebook and Instagram and more brands buying adds on newer features like TikTok competitor Reels, said analysts.

Analysts on average expect Meta to report a 4.5% decline in ad revenue, which would be the company's second straight quarter of decline, according to Refinitiv data.

Shares of Meta are down 60% so far this year, hurt by fierce competition from short-form video app TikTok, and by its own expensive investment in building the metaverse and ads that are now less effective due to Apple's privacy changes.

""The company now known as Meta is a far cry from Facebook one year ago,"" said Debra Williamson, principal analyst at research firm Insider Intelligence. ""After a dismal earnings report in Q2, we aren't expecting Q3 to be any better. It's very possible it will be much worse.""

Ads from large retailers promoting back-to-school and fall shopping are expected to help lead to growth at digital pinboard platform Pinterest Inc (PINS.N), said analysts at Bernstein in a note on Monday. Wall Street is expecting revenue to grow 5% from the prior-year quarter.

However, some advertisers are shifting ad dollars to larger platforms that are used by more people and which have been proven to deliver sales results, said Credit Suisse analysts, which poses a risk to Pinterest's revenue in the fourth quarter and next year.

Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), which is working to close a deal to be acquired by billionaire Elon Musk, has not yet announced a date to report third-quarter earnings.

Twitter's results are unlikely to affect its share price, which is trading on the likelihood of the Musk deal closing. But the third-quarter results could be hurt by marketers spending less on ""brand ads"" that build name recognition, which constitutes most of Twitter's business, said Bernstein analysts.

Snap and Meta have become more known for so-called performance ads, which are used to drive sales or website visits.

Summary

Summary Companies 12-week consultation will end May 19

'We hope to move very quickly' -Breton

Tech firms oppose what they say is an internet tax















BRUSSELS, Feb 23 (Reuters) - The European Commission drew criticism from Meta Platform (META.O) and other Big Tech firms on Thursday with the launch of a consultation on who should foot the bill for billions of euros of investments in Europe's telecoms network.

For more than two decades Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), Orange (ORAN.PA), Telefonica (TEF.MC), Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) and other operators have lobbied for leading technology companies to contribute to 5G and broadband roll-out.

They argue Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google, Apple (AAPL.O), Meta, Netflix (NFLX.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) account for more than half of data internet traffic.

The tech firms in response call it an internet tax that will undermine European Union network neutrality rules to treat all users equally. The 12-week consultation will end on May 19.

Meta, in its first public comments on the topic, said regulators should acknowledge Big Tech's investments.

""Meta invests tens of billions of dollars in our apps and platforms every year to facilitate the hosting of content, creating enormous value across the digital ecosystem,"" a spokesperson said.

""By not recognising that value flows both ways between telecoms companies and content-hosting platforms, this consultation is based on a false premise.""

EU industry chief Thierry Breton cited the heavy investments for 5G and broadband, saying he was not targeting any company.

""The burden of these investments is heavier and heavier. And that is in part because of a low return on investment in the telecoms sector, the increase of the cost of raw materials, and the world geopolitical context, the cost of energy, of course, because that has a big role to play,"" he told a news briefing.

""All of this reflection isn't aimed against anyone at all, rather it's for our fellow citizens,"" Breton said, adding that he was aware of time constraints in trying to wrap up the issue by the end of 2023.

""We hope to move very quickly so that in the summer we will be able to come back with conclusions and then we will see what we do to continue to make progress,"" he said.

Breton said a contributions mechanism could be one of the solutions. Other options include a continental or digital levy or fund according to a document seen by Reuters last month.

Telefonica CEO Jose Maria Alvarez-Pallete said Big Tech is as much a customer as other users.

""This would not be like a tax, we would charge them like they were customers, why do some customers pay and others not. It's correcting an anomaly,"" he told Reuters.

Telecoms lobbying group ETNO echoed this, saying the consultation was an urgent step to address major imbalances, but the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA) criticised the proposal in a statement.

""Europeans already pay telecom operators for internet access, they should not have to pay telcos a second time through pricier streaming and cloud services,"" said Christian Borggreen, CCIA Europe's senior vice president.

Any legislative proposal will need to be agreed with EU member states and EU lawmakers before it can become law.

271,META,2023-03-09,Meta's oversight board to review moderation of Arabic word 'shaheed',"













March 9 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms' (META.O) oversight board said on Thursday it would review the moderation of the Arabic word ""shaheed"", which means ""martyr"" in English, as it accounts for more content removals on its platforms than any other single word or phrase.

Meta has asked the board for advice on whether it should continue to remove posts that use the word ""shaheed"" to refer to individuals designated as dangerous, or use a different approach, the board said.

""This is a complex moderation issue that impacts how millions of people express themselves online and whether Muslim and Arabic-speaking communities are subject to over-enforcement of their content because of Meta's enforcement practices,"" said Thomas Hughes, director of oversight board administration.

Moderating the word may result in over-enforcement, particularly in Arabic-speaking countries, and could have an impact on news reporting in those regions, the board noted and called for public comments to assist with its deliberations.

The oversight board was created in late 2020 to review Facebook and Instagram's decisions on taking down or retaining certain content and make rulings on whether to uphold or overturn the social media company's actions.

The board also said on Thursday it would look into a case related to a post calling for the ""siege"" of Brazil's congress following the election of President Lula da Silva.

Jan 25 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) social media apps appeared to be back up after facing a brief disruption in the United States on Wednesday, data on outage tracking website Downdetector.com showed.

At the peak of the outage, more than 17,000 user reports had indicated issues with Instagram in the United States, as of 2352 GMT. Over 13,000 incidents were reported for the Facebook app and outage reports also briefly spiked for WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger around the same time.

Downdetector tracks outages by collating status reports from several sources including user-submitted errors on its platform.

Outages of Big Tech platforms are not uncommon as several companies ranging from Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google to Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) have seen service disruptions.

Microsoft was hit with a networking outage earlier on Wednesday that took down its cloud platform Azure along with services such as Teams and Outlook, affecting millions of users globally.

Meta did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

273,META,2023-01-19,Meta's WhatsApp fined 5.5 mln euro by lead EU privacy regulator,"













DUBLIN, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Meta's (META.O) WhatsApp subsidiary was fined 5.5 million euros ($5.95 million) on Thursday by Ireland's Data Privacy Commissioner (DPC), its lead EU privacy regulator, for an additional breach of the bloc's privacy laws.

The DPC also told WhatsApp to reassess how it uses personal data for service improvements following a similar order it issued this month to Meta's other main platforms, Facebook and Instagram, which stated Meta must reassess the legal basis upon which it targets advertising through the use of personal data.

A spokesperson for WhatsApp said it intended to appeal the decision, and that it strongly believed that the way its service operates is both technically and legally compliant.

The Irish watchdog, which is the lead EU regulator for many of the world's top technology companies due to the location of their European headquarters in Ireland, directed WhatsApp to bring its processing operations into compliance within six months.

The DPC fined WhatsApp 225 million euros in September 2021 for breaches that occurred in May 2018, the same period of time as the complaint dealt with on Thursday. WhatsApp is in the process of appealing that fine through the Irish courts.

The regulator has fined Meta 1.3 billion euros to date and has 10 other inquiries open into its services.

274,META,2022-10-21,Snap sets off alarm bells in ad-reliant social media sector,"













Oct 21 (Reuters) - Snap Inc (SNAP.N) shares sank more than 30% on Friday and hit their lowest since the pandemic, after the company's forecast of zero revenue growth pointed to more pain ahead for a social media sector heavily dependant on digital advertising.

Facebook-parent Meta Platform Inc (META.O) and Pinterest Inc (PINS.N) fell between 2% and 7%. Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) slid 3%, also dragged by fears of security reviews of billionaire Elon Musk's takeover bid. read more

Analysts rushed to cut their price target on Snap, with Morgan Stanley taking it to a Wall Street low of $7. In early trading the stock hit its lowest since early 2019.

Macroeconomic concerns, changing social media user behavior affects advertiser spending

The digital ad space has suffered as brands have cut marketing and ad budgets in response to declining consumer demand. Snap's warning exacerbated those fears.

""This truly is a cautionary tale ... advertisers might show that we're already in a recession because of their unwillingness to spend on these smaller platforms,"" said Bokeh Capital Partners' Kim Forrest.

So far this year, digital ad companies have together lost roughly $1 trillion in value, hit by intense competition from TikTok and challenges from Apple Inc's privacy changes to its iOS platform that allows users to opt out of data tracking.

Snap reported its slowest revenue growth as a public company for the latest quarter on Thursday, and forecast no revenue growth for the typically busy holiday quarter.

SNAP'S WOES

Advertisers have relied on Snap's platform to tap into its popularity among teens and young adults.

But Apple's privacy changes have made it more difficult to track and measure ads on Snapchat, causing major brands to shift their ad spending to bigger platforms that reach more people.

""A challenged macro continues to see ad buyers prioritize their larger, core platforms, namely Google and Meta, as they monitor consumer health,"" Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik said, adding that ad buyers reducing their spend particularly on smaller experimental platforms.

Snap's stock has lost about 77% of its value so far this year, while Alphabet, Meta and Pinterest have lost between 30% and 60%. Twitter, however, has gained 21% on the prospect of billionaire Musk buying the company.

""We now believe that Snap will have difficulty remaining under control of its own destiny over the next six to nine months,"" MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni said.

275,META,2022-11-29,Twitter rolls back COVID misinformation policy,"













Nov 29 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc has rolled back a policy that was aimed at tackling misinformation related to COVID-19 on the social media platform, lending itself to the risk of a potential surge in false claims even as cases rise in China and some parts of the world.

The move also comes amid concerns of Twitter's ability to fight misinformation after it let go about half of its staff, including those involved in content moderation, under new boss Elon Musk.

""Effective November 23, 2022, Twitter is no longer enforcing the COVID-19 misleading information policy,"" according to an update on its blog page. The update was first reported by CNN on Tuesday.

The specific measures that Twitter will drop were not immediately clear, and the company did not immediately respond to a request to share more information.

At the onset of COVID in 2020, Twitter instated a number of measures including labels and warning messages on tweets with disputed information about the health crisis and a framework to have users remove tweets that advanced harmfully false claims related to vaccines.

Meta Platforms Inc-owned (META.O) Facebook and Alphabet Inc's YouTube services employed similar measures, which are currently in place.

Meta in July sought the opinion of its independent oversight board on changes to its current approach given the improvement in authentic information sources and general awareness around COVID.

Early this year, Twitter said that since March 2021 it had stopped enforcing a ""civic integrity policy"" related to lies about the 2020 U.S. presidential election.

Billionaire Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, paying $44 billion for the company, and has moved quickly to initiate a number of changes to product and staff. Musk said on Oct. 29 he would set up a content moderation council with ""widely diverse viewpoints"".

276,META,2022-05-12,U.S. lawmakers ask tech companies to archive evidence of potential Russian war crimes,"













May 12 (Reuters) - Four Democratic lawmakers on Thursday asked the CEOs of YouTube, TikTok, Twitter (TWTR.N) and Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) to archive content that could be used as evidence of suspected Russian war crimes in Ukraine.

Ukraine and the West say Russian troops have committed war crimes in its 11-week invasion of its neighbor, in which thousands of civilians have been killed. Russia denies the allegations and says it does not target civilians.

In a letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the lawmakers, including the leaders of the House Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees, Carolyn Maloney and Gregory Meeks, encouraged the company to preserve content posted on its sites.

That content ""could potentially be used as evidence as the U.S. government and international human rights and accountability monitors investigate Russian war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other atrocities in Ukraine,"" the letter said.

The letters were also signed by two subcommittee chairmen, William Keating and Stephen Lynch.

The U.N. Human Rights Council passed a resolution on Thursday to establish an investigation into possible war crimes by Russian troops in places near the capital Kyiv and beyond, a move that Russia said amounted to political score-settling. read more

277,META,2022-10-25,WhatsApp back online after global outage hits users,"













BENGALURU/STOCKHOLM, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Messaging app WhatsApp was starting to come back online at 0900 GMT and the company said the issue has been fixed after users across the world reported problems earlier on Tuesday.

At around 0750 GMT, outage reporting site Downdetector had shown over 68,000 users had reported problems with the app in the United Kingdom. Problems were reported by 19,000 people in Singapore and 15,000 people in South Africa, as well.

""We know people had trouble sending messages on WhatsApp today. We have fixed the issue and apologise for any inconvenience,"" a spokesperson for WhatsApp parent company Meta Platforms (META.O) said.

""The brief outage was a result of a technical error on our part and has now been resolved,"" Meta added.

WhatsApp has become a critical means of communication for households and businesses. When WhatsApp had an hours-long outage last October, it hit trading of assets from cryptocurrencies to oil, before traders switched to alternative platforms such as Telegram.

""This highlights the significance of vast hosting companies directing data around the internet along with companies and individuals relying on single points of communication,"" said Jack Moore, advisor at Slovakia-based cybersecurity firm ESET.

""Multiple areas will inevitably be significantly impacted as a result of this downtime, along with a predicted financial hit but lessons from other recent prominent times when the internet has gone down will have hopefully taught many to have access to other forms of communication.""

WhatsApp's latest outage came during the festive season in India - its biggest market by user count - when people use the platform even more than usual to send season's greetings.

Shares of WhatsApp-parent Meta Platforms (META.O) rose nearly 4% in afternoon trading. They had fallen 0.7% to $128.85 in premarket trading following the outage.

The company had not sent any fresh updates as users in Asia, India and the United Kingdom started seeing some connections come back online.

#whatsappdown was trending on Twitter, with more than 142000 tweets and hundreds of memes flooding the internet.

""Everyone who noticed #whatsapp is down have come to twitter to confirm it,"" says one Twitter user.

In the past, rival apps like Telegram, Snap or even Meta's Instagram have seen temporary spikes in users when WhatsApp has been down.

While WhatsApp boasts of over two billion monthly active users and have become a mainstay for messaging in most countries, Telegram has taken up the challenger role with about 700 million users.

278,META,2023-03-17,Brazil looks to regulate monetized content on Internet,"













SAO PAULO, March 17 (Reuters) - The Brazilian government is studying whether to regulate Internet platforms with content that earns revenue such as advertising, its secretary for digital policies, Joao Brant, said on Friday.

The idea would be for a regulator to hold such platforms, not consumers, accountable for monetized content, Brant told Reuters.

Another goal is ""to prevent the networks from being used for the dissemination and promotion of crimes and illegal content"" especially after the riots by supporters of former far-right President JairBolsonaro in Brasilia in January, fueled by misinformation about the election he lost in October.

Brant said President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's government also intends to make companies responsible for stopping misinformation, hate speech and other crimes on their social media platforms. Platforms would not be held responsible for content individually, but for how diligent they are in protecting the ""digital environment,"" he said in an interview.

Brant did not detail what the regulatory body would look like, but said the government wants to regulate monetized content and prevent the platforms from spreading misinformation.

""What the body would do is monitor whether the platforms are fulfilling their obligations well, and not deal with individual content published by users. That must be up to the courts,"" he said.

Brant did not specify the role the judiciary would play in fighting misinformation.

Any proposal would require changes to the regulatory framework in the 2014 law known as the ""Marco Civil"" that governs the Internet in Brazil and protects the rights of users.

The law's Article 19 exempts platforms from legal responsibility ""for damages resulting from content generated by third parties"", unless there is a specific court order for the removal of the content.

For Brant, the current framework ""generates an incentive for platforms not to take care of the public space of debate.""

The absence of accountability for content that is promoted, monetized or presented as advertising must be reconsidered, he said, adding: ""For them to have zero responsibility for that content is very bad.""

Brazil's Supreme Court has been discussing the constitutionality of Article 19 since 2017, based on a lawsuit filed by Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) Meta, owner of Facebook and WhatsApp.

Meta questioned its responsibility for removing content without a court decision in a case involving a fake Facebook profile. The court scheduled a public hearing on the issue for March 28.

279,META,2022-06-24,"Disney, other U.S. companies offer abortion travel benefit after Roe decision","













NEW YORK, June 24 (Reuters) - U.S. companies including Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) said on Friday they will cover employees' expenses if they have to travel for abortion services after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday overturned the landmark 1973 ruling that recognized a woman's constitutional right to an abortion, handing a victory to Republicans and religious conservatives who want to limit or ban and, in some states criminalize, the procedure. read more

Many states are expected to further restrict or ban abortions following the ruling, making it difficult for female employees to terminate pregnancies unless they travel to states where the procedure is allowed.

For example, in Oklahoma a bill due to take effect in August bans abortion except in medical emergencies and penalizes providers who violate the law with up to $100,000 in fines and 10 years in prison. States offering abortion protections include New York and Maryland. read more

Disney told employees on Friday that it remains committed to providing comprehensive access to quality healthcare, including for abortions, according to a Disney spokesperson. read more

The company's benefits will cover the cost of employees who need to travel to another location to access care, including to obtain an abortion, it said.

Facebook owner Meta will reimburse travel expenses for employees seeking out-of-state reproductive care, but the company was also ""assessing how best to do so given the legal complexities involved,"" according to a spokesperson.

But Meta also moved to limit internal discussion of the ruling. Moderators on its forum Workplace removed posts mentioning abortion, citing a ""respectful communications"" policy barring employee discussions of political topics, according to a LinkedIn post by a Meta employee in Seattle.

Moderators also took down links to Facebook posts by outgoing Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg that condemned the ruling, the employee wrote.

The Meta spokesperson declined to comment on internal policy when asked about the reports of limiting internal discussion.

Policies supporting abortions varied among companies.

Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS.N) Chief Executive Lauren Hobart said on LinkedIn that the company would pay up to $4,000 in travel for employees or their family members and a support person if abortion was not available nearby.

Companies that offer reimbursements for abortion-related travel could be vulnerable to lawsuits by anti-abortion groups and Republican-led states, and even potential criminal penalties.

Lawyers and other experts said employers could face claims that their policies violate state laws banning, facilitating or aiding and abetting abortions.

Ride hailing company Lyft (LYFT.O) said it would legally shield drivers in abortion cases, saying it would expand a recent policy as new state laws were passed. ""No driver should have to ask a rider where they are going and why,"" a spokesperson said.

A draft of the Supreme Court ruling on abortion was leaked in May. At that time, many other companies, including online review site Yelp (YELP.N), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), and Tesla (TSLA.O), said they would help cover the cost of travel for employees seeking reproductive services. Apple (AAPL.O) repeated that it supported employees making their own decisions on reproductive health and that its healthcare covered travel for services unavailable nearby.

Yelp co-founder and Chief Executive Jeremy Stoppelman on Friday said the ruling ""puts women's health in jeopardy, denies them their human rights, and threatens to dismantle the progress we've made toward gender equality in the workplace since Roe.""

Alaska Air Group (ALK.N), parent of Alaska Airlines, said on Friday it is ""reimbursing travel for certain medical procedures and treatments if they are not available where you live. Today's Supreme Court decision does not change that.""

Other companies offering the benefit include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), online dating sites OkCupid and Bumble Inc (BMBL.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the nation's largest bank. read more

OkCupid sent in-app messages to customers in 26 states likely to ban abortions, gearing up for a political fight. ""Act now by calling your representatives and demanding freedom and choice,"" said a copy of the message tweeted by OkCupid Chief Marketing Officer Melissa Hobley.

280,META,2022-11-10,Adland veterans play tortoise to Big Tech’s hare,"













LONDON, Nov 10 (Reuters Breakingviews) - For years, the “Big Four” Western ad holding companies – WPP (WPP.L), Omnicom (OMC.N), Publicis (PUBP.PA) and Interpublic (IPG.N) – have been the tortoise to Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Meta Platforms (META.O) and other Big Tech groups’ hare. That’s now changing, and recessionary risks could exacerbate the effect.

In the three years to the end of 2021, Alphabet, Meta and Snap (SNAP.N) hared ahead. They grew at an average 36% clip each quarter, relative to the same period 12 months previously. On the same metric and time period, WPP and its three traditional rivals could only muster 1.5% organic growth. The upshot was the Big Tech groups boasted 2021 revenue of $380 billion, most of which was digital advertising. WPP and its three rivals don’t break out their digital ad top lines, but their overall revenues for the same year were only around $40 billion.

In the third quarter of 2022, the growth rates sharply inverted. Alphabet, Meta and Snap saw revenue up a miserly 2.4%, on average. The traditional adland quartet, in contrast, saw growth of 6.8%.

Reuters Graphics

Why? For one thing, digital ad giants’ stellar 2021 made maintaining the pace trickier. For another, WPP and rivals have found ways to grow other than via ads, most noticeably by helping clients build apps and crunch data. Most importantly, privacy changes to Apple’s (AAPL.O) iOS operating system made it harder for marketers to connect users seeing ads with users making purchases across different apps, rendering the original ads less valuable.

The third-quarter growth inversion may not be a flash in the pan. Previously platforms like Google and Facebook were able to rope in first-time marketers and massively expand their advertising pie, according to Berenberg. But a sharp recession may mean those same businesses can’t afford to carry on advertising: Redburn analysts reckon digital advertising is easier to “switch off” at the first sign of macroeconomic trouble. The tech interlopers are also more exposed to small and medium-sized businesses that are most likely to be affected by soaring input costs. One Jefferies survey of small businesses found 87% of them used Facebook for digital marketing, and 75% Instagram.

In contrast, ad agencies are relatively more exposed to bigger clients, which are more likely to maintain their advertising budgets. WPP Chief Executive Mark Read noted last month that Swiss behemoth Nestlé (NESN.S) was actually looking to increase its marketing spend in the second half of 2022. Meta and Alphabet will still see some of this cash given traditional ad players will use platforms like Google for these big clients’ digital advertising. But for the first time in ages, the adland veterans are not the poor relations.

281,META,2022-04-19,Australia's CBA rebuffs reports of partnership with crypto trading platform,"













April 19 (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AX) warned of a fake news article doing rounds on social media platforms alleging the country's No. 1 lender to have partnered with a cryptocurrency trading platform to encourage people to invest in crypto assets.

CBA branded the article to be ""totally false and untrue"" on Tuesday, adding that it had reported it to the relevant authorities and asked social media publishers, including Facebook, to take down the article.

The report comes months after Australia's richest man and chairman of Fortescue Metals Group (FMG.AX), Andrew Forest, filed a lawsuit against Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (FB.O) alleging it breached anti-money laundering laws and used his image to promote cryptocurrency schemes.

Last month, Australia's competition watchdog had also filed a similar lawsuit against Meta with allegations of promoting fake cryptocurrency ads featuring well-known people. read more

CBA added that it has warned Australians through its own channels not to respond to or click through to the website if they receive the alleged fake article.

It also alleged that the article was ""designed to entice unsuspecting people to go to the scammer's website and provide their personal details and money.""

Last year, CBA became Australia's first main-street bank to offer a platform for retail customers to trade in cryptocurrencies. read more

282,META,2023-02-01,Exclusive: European telecoms' advertising venture set for EU approval -sources,"













BRUSSELS, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), Orange (ORAN.PA), Telefonica (TEF.MC) and Vodafone's (VOD.L) plan to take on Big Tech with their own advertising joint venture is set to win unconditional EU antitrust approval, people familiar with the matter said.

The joint venture marks the telecoms sector's first attempt to take on Meta (META.O) and Alphabet'S (GOOGL.O) Google in the lucrative online advertising sector and diversify their revenue streams.

Google is the world's leading seller of online advertising, well ahead of Meta, with the business generating about 80% of its revenue.

The European Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by Feb. 10 after its preliminary review, and Vodafone declined to comment.

Telefonica referred to the joint filing with the EU antitrust watchdog. Deutsche Telekom and Orange did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The EU competition enforcer describes the joint venture as a privacy-led, digital identification solution to support the digital marketing and advertising activities of brands and publishers.

Earlier this week, pan-European consumer lobbying group BEUC voiced concerns over how data would be collected by the joint venture and how the partners aim to get users' consent.

It urged EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager to ensure that the joint venture complies with the bloc's privacy rules and the companies do not thwart rivals which may offer a more privacy friendly product.

March 25 (Reuters) - New Zealand media firm NZME (NZM.NZ) said on Friday it has signed a letter of intent with Google to outline terms for news content delivery, as the country's publishers take on digital platforms over fair payment for news displayed on their sites.

NZME, which owns the New Zealand Herald, also said it was in discussions with Facebook parent Meta Platforms (FB.O) over various digital projects for next year.

New Zealand's news publishers association had sought approval to collectively bargain with Meta Platforms and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) unit Google for fair payments, but NZME chose to engage with the tech giants directly.

NZME will enter a 90-day period of negotiation with Google to finalise key terms of the proposed supply of its news content to Google's News Showcase and other news products, it said on Friday.

The final deal was intended to be for a minimum of five years.

The company's portfolio includes several regional newspapers, as well as radio channels and online websites.

NZME also said it expects 2022 core earnings between NZ$67 million ($46.63 million) and NZ$72 million, if it finalises the deal with Google at the end of the negotiation period.

Oct 26 (Reuters) - Gloomy results from Alphabet and Microsoft stoked fears of a global economic downturn and derailed an earnings-led surge in stock markets on Wednesday, while setting the tone for results from other megacap technology giants.

The Nasdaq (.IXIC) tumbled nearly 2% as the results underscored the fallout of strong dollar and weak demand on the tech sector against the backdrop of high inflation and rising borrowing costs.

Shares of the Google-parent (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) fell about 8% in early trading. Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), which will report after markets close, was down 4%, while Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) lost 4% and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) 1% in the run-up to their results on Thursday.

Heavyweights Netflix (NFLX.O), Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Apple have already lost a combined market value of more than $2.5 trillion so far this year and were set to shed another $330 billion on Wednesday.

""The results of the big technology firms were seen as a key determining factor in market sentiment going into the U.S. third quarter reporting season and both Microsoft and Alphabet have given investors reason to worry,"" said Laith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at AJ Bell.

Alphabet missed Wall Street's target for revenue growth in the third quarter as ad sales remained weak, while inflation and a strong dollar led Microsoft to report its slowest topline growth in five years. read more

Reuters Graphics

At least 21 analysts cut their price target on Alphabet, lowering it by as much as $36, while 17 of them brought down their targets on Microsoft.

With analysts predicting a pullback in budgets for advertising due to rising prices, investors fear that Meta's business too could come under pressure as it revenue relies heavily on ads.

""Investors will be bracing for Meta's results with some trepidation, with a common thought being that if Google's struggling, the rest of the tech pack faces a marathon climb,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

For Meta, Google Search's soft results are worrisome while YouTube and Snap weakness suggest that macro and ad targeting challenges continued in the third quarter, JMP Securities analyst Andrew Boone wrote.

Meanwhile, a slowdown in growth at Azure, Microsoft's cloud platform and one of its most successful businesses, raised worries around Amazon's cloud business.

While most Big Tech stocks have edged higher in the past few weeks, overall it has been a bleak year for the sector that has lost roughly 15% to 60% of their value.

Wednesday's selloff also hit Europe's tech index (.SX8P), falling 2.3% to lead sectoral losses in the region. read more

Feb 3 (Reuters) - After a challenging 2022 in which advertising-dependent companies faced shrinking budgets and cratering stock prices, fourth-quarter results this week from Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Snap showed they were not yet in the clear.

The health of the advertising industry closely mirrors the economy, and many advertisers have pared back their marketing budgets in response to record-high inflation rates and continued uncertainty about a recession.

""While many people do not believe we will see that serious a recession, weaker sentiment among corporates has been enough to already feed into lower spending on digital advertising,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.

Google-owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) on Thursday reported a slight fall in quarterly ad revenue, missing Wall Street expectations and surprising investors as the world's largest digital ad platform has traditionally been resilient compared to smaller rivals. Shares of Alphabet were down more than 4% in premarket trading.

""For a company the size of Google and as influential as Google to have such disappointing results, (that means the ad industry) won't turn around in one quarter,"" said Evelyn Mitchell, an analyst at Insider Intelligence.

Snap Inc (SNAP.N), owner of photo messaging app Snapchat, said Tuesday it expects current-quarter revenue to decline as much as 10% due to competition for ad dollars and a challenging economy.

""(Advertisers) are managing their spend very cautiously so they can react quickly to any changes in the environment,"" Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said during an earnings call.

Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), the second-largest digital ad platform, lifted Wall Street on Wednesday with its cost cuts and big share buyback, though it posted its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue decline.

Lower ad spending from brands in the financial services and technology sector was one reason for the revenue decline, the company said.

Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said the broader economy continues to be ""pretty volatile"" and it was too early to tell what the year would look like.

The mood among advertisers broadly is one of ""cautious optimism"" for the year ahead, said Nicola Mendelsohn, Meta's vice president of global business group, in an interview on Thursday.

By region, advertisers have been bullish about the U.S. market, while sentiment in Europe has struggled comparatively and China has shown signs of improvement, though the future remains uncertain amid the country's reopening, Mendelsohn said.

286,META,2023-02-07,"Big Tech not doing enough to remove fake news, activist NGO Avaaz says","













BRUSSELS, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Twitter, Google's (GOOGL.O) YouTube, Meta Platform's (META.O) Facebook, Microsoft's (MSFT.O) LinkedIn and TikTok are not doing enough to remove fake news from their platforms, raising doubts about their ability to comply with new EU online content rules, activist NGO Avaaz said on Tuesday.

The companies are due to present reports this week on the measures they have taken to comply with the updated EU code of practice on disinformation which is linked to the online content rules known as the Digital Services Act (DSA) that came into force last November.

Avaaz said it analysed a sample pool of 108 fact-checked pieces of content related to a 2022 American anti-vaccine film and found efforts by the social media platforms including Meta's Instagram to remove disinformation fell short.

""Overall, just 22% of disinformation content we analysed was either labelled or removed by the six major platforms,"" Avaaz said.

It said the companies did not do enough to tackle disinformation in languages other than English.

""Despite explicit platform commitments in the code to improve their services in all EU languages, our research found that in certain EU languages - Italian, German, Hungarian, Danish, Spanish and Estonian - no platform took any action against violating posts,"" Avaaz said.

""This study suggests that most of the major platforms are failing to comply with their Code of Practice commitments and might infringe upcoming DSA obligations,"" the group said.

Meta, Alphabet, Twitter and Microsoft last year vowed to take a tougher line against disinformation after committing to the updated EU code.

Companies face fines up to 6% of their global turnover for DSA violations.

AMSTERDAM, March 15 (Reuters) - A Dutch court hearing a class action lawsuit on Wednesday found that a European subsidiary of Meta (META.O), Facebook Ireland, improperly used personal data of Dutch citizens between 2010 and 2020, saying the company had ""violated the law"".

""Personal information was processed for the purposes of advertising when in this case that is not allowed,"" a summary of the Amsterdam court ruling said.

""Personal information was given to third parties without Facebook users being informed and without there being a legal basis to do so.""

The decision was directed at Facebook Ireland because it is the part of the company that oversees the processing of Dutch user data. The case has not yet progressed to the phase where any damages could be claimed.

A spokesperson for Meta said the company was ""pleased"" with parts of the decision but would appeal others, noting that some of the claims date back more than a decade.

""We know that privacy is important to our Dutch users and we want them to have control over how their data is used,"" the person said.

A spokesperson for the plaintiff, Data Privacy Stichting, said the group now hopes to sit down with Facebook to negotiate a settlement.

It's ""a pretty big decision and we're obviously very glad,"" said spokesperson Gerard Spierenburg.""

""We think this is a very strong signal not only to Facebook but to all companies that are unrightfully using their users' data.""

The Data Privacy group was launched in 2020 as a partnership between a group of law firms and the Dutch Consumers' Association to try to seek damages.

Spierenburg said 190,000 had signed up for the initiative, but any of the roughly 10 million Dutch people who used Facebook during the relevant period can join if the case moves to a damages phase.

288,META,2023-03-09,Groq adapts Meta's chatbot for its own chips in race against Nvidia,"[1/2] A GroqNode rack of Silicon Valley AI chip startup Groq is seen installed at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, U.S., March, 2023. Groq Inc./Amanda Dalton/Handout via REUTERS















OAKLAND, California, March 9 (Reuters) - Groq, a Silicon Valley chip startup founded by a former Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) engineer, said on Thursday it has adapted technology similar to the underpinnings of the wildly popular ChatGPT to run on its chips.

Groq modified LLaMA, a large language model released last month by Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) that can be used to power bots to generate human-like text.

The move is significant because Meta's researchers originally developed LLaMA using chips from Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), which has a market share of nearly 90% for AI computing according to some estimates. Showing that a cutting-edge model can be moved to Groq's chips easily could help the startup prove that its products are a viable alternative to Nvidia.

Groq has been trying to chip away at Nvidia's market share, along with startups such as SambaNova and Cerebras and big companies like Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O).

Efforts to find alternative chips to Nvidia's have gained extra steam with the popularity of ChatGPT which has focused attention on Nvidia's dominant role in AI. The public battle to dominate the AI technology space kicked off late last year with the launch of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT and prompted tech heavyweights from Alphabet to China's Baidu Inc (9888.HK) to trumpet their own offerings.

Meta made its code available to researchers for noncommercial use. Groq used Meta's model but stripped out the code that was included in order to make the model run on an Nvidia chip, Groq CEO Jonathan Ross told Reuters.

Groq then ran that model through Groq Compiler which automatically adds specific code for it to run on its own computing system. A compiler turns code into ones and zeros so a chip can read them.

Ross said the company's goal is to make it easy to move models from Nvidia's chips to its own. He said using the Groq system can also eliminate engineering effort each time changes are made to the LlaMA or other models to get it to work on the chips.

Meta Platforms declined to comment. The company has been working on making it easier for developers to use non-Nvidia chips and in October launched a set of free software tools for AI applications that enable switching back and forth between Nvidia and AMD chips.

Sept 22 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) Instagram said on Thursday it had resolved the issues that caused a brief outage on its platform for several users earlier in the day.

As much as 24,000 people reported having trouble accessing the social network, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com.

Several users took to Twitter to share updates and memes about the service disruption, with #instagramdown trending as a hashtag on the social media site.

290,META,2022-12-14,Meta's Oversight Board restores Nigeria church attack video on Instagram,"













ABUJA, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Meta's Oversight Board on Wednesday overturned a decision to remove a video that was shared on Instagram showing the gruesome aftermath of an attack on a church in Nigeria that killed at least 40 people.

The video showing motionless, bloodied bodies on the floor, apparently the aftermath of the church attack that took place on June 5 in Owo, southwest Nigeria, was shared by an Instagram user on the same day.

Meta removed the video, saying hashtags added by the user could be read as glorifying violence and minimizing suffering. The user appealed against the removal to the independent board.

The board on Wednesday asked Meta to restore the post with a ""disturbing content"" warning screen, saying this would protect victims' privacy while allowing for discussion of events.

""Nigeria is experiencing an ongoing series of terrorist attacks and the Nigerian government has suppressed coverage of some of them, though it does not appear to have done so in relation to the June 5 attack,"" the board said.

""The Board agrees that in such contexts freedom of expression is particularly important.""

Nigerian authorities have accused insurgents from the Islamic State in West Africa group of carrying out the attack on St Francis Catholic Church, which took place during Pentecost Sunday mass. Five suspects were arrested in August.

The Nigerian government has been exploring ways to regulate social media use in the country, Africa's most populous. Millions of Nigerians are active users of YouTube, Twitter , Facebook (META.O) and TikTok.

The West African country has asked Google to block the use of YouTube channels and livestreams by banned groups and terrorist organizations in the country.

291,META,2023-03-07,New EU-US data pact may come too late for Facebook -regulator,"Summary

Summary Companies Facebook may face EU-U.S. data freeze by May

Action due to concerns about U.S. intelligence

New EU-U.S data privacy deal may come later















DUBLIN, March 7 (Reuters) - A new pact to facilitate the safe transfer of EU citizens' personal data to the United States might not come into force in time to avoid a suspension of Facebook's transatlantic data flows, the U.S. firm's lead European regulator said on Tuesday.

Facebook owner Meta (META.O), which has warned a stoppage could force it to suspend Facebook services in Europe, declined to comment on the possible timing of the regulator's decision or the new pact's entry into force.

European Union regulators led by Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) Helen Dixon are finalising a ban on the legal tool used by Facebook to transfer European user data because of concerns U.S. intelligence agencies could access them.

In an interview, Dixon said the ban could be in place by mid-May while a new EU-U.S data protection framework that would provide an alternative basis for the transfers might take longer.

""There is certainly a chance of that. More than a chance, I would say,"" said Dixon, who is lead European regulator for U.S. technology firms, including Apple (AAPL.O), Google (GOOGL.O) and Twitter (TWTR.MX), as their regional headquarters are in Ireland.

""They could be very close in timeline or the DPC's suspension order could come into effect in advance,"" Dixon told Reuters. ""Things are coming down to the wire.""

The suspension could create a precedent for other firms. It must be signed off by other European regulators by April 13, and after that, Dixon said she would have another month to issue a ruling.

A spokesperson for Meta said the company ""welcomes the progress policymakers have made towards ensuring the continued transfer of data across borders and awaits the regulator’s final decision on this matter.""

NEW FRAMEWORK

Officials have said the new EU-U.S. framework, which aims to offer EU citizens the same level of data protection as under European law, may be ready by summer. ""They are still talking about July,"" Dixon said.

It is expected to face legal challenge from critics who believe it is too weak. Two previous U.S.-EU pacts, Safe Harbour and Privacy Shield, were struck down by the European Union's top court.

Dixon said she and her fellow regulators were positive about the new deal and that the European Commission was confident it would survive court challenge.

Critics, such as privacy campaigner Max Schrems have accused Dixon and her office of being under-resourced and too soft, a charge she rejected.

""We are really hitting our stride, working at pace,"" said Dixon, whose office issued over 1 billion euros in fines last year - around two-thirds of the fines issues in the EU and Britain combined last year.

It is working on 22 large-scale international cases including against Google, Meta and Tik Tok, after concluding 17 cases last year, she said.

It plans to increase its staffing to around 250 this year from 200 last year and 27 when Dixon joined in 2014.

292,META,2022-10-21,Snap sets off alarm bells in ad-reliant social media sector,"













Oct 21 (Reuters) - Snap Inc (SNAP.N) shares sank nearly 30% in premarket trading on Friday, after the company's forecast of zero revenue growth pointed to more pain ahead for a social media sector heavily dependant on digital advertising.

YouTube-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Facebook-parent Meta Platform Inc (META.O) and Pinterest Inc (PINS.N) fell between 2% and 7%. Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) slid 8%, also dragged by fears of security reviews of billionaire Elon Musk's takeover bid. read more

Analysts rushed to cut their price target on the stock, with Morgan Stanley taking it to a Wall Street low of $7, below the $7.74 the stock was trading at.

Macroeconomic concerns, changing social media user behavior affects advertiser spending

The digital ad space has suffered as brands have cut marketing and ad budgets in response to declining consumer demand. Snap's warning exacerbated the fears.

So far this year, digital ad companies have together lost roughly $1 trillion in value, hit by intense competition from TikTok and challenges from Apple Inc's privacy changes to its iOS platform that allows users to opt out of data tracking.

Snap reported its slowest revenue growth as a public company for the latest quarter on Thursday, and forecast no revenue growth for the typically busy holiday quarter.

SNAP'S WOES

Snap, which sells ads through videos and a range of filters, is seen as an ""experimental platform"" by many advertisers, who tend to quickly shift their shrinking ad dollars to larger established platforms.

""A challenged macro continues to see ad buyers prioritize their larger, core platforms, namely Google and Meta, as they monitor consumer health,"" Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik said, adding that ad buyers reducing their spend particularly on smaller experimental platforms.

Analysts are also concerned about Snap's move to slash headcount by 20%.

Jefferies analysts noted that Snap has been growing headcount at over 30% for four straight quarters, but raised concerns about the company's ability to meet growth targets with a smaller employee base.

Snap's stock has lost about 77% of its value so far this year, while Alphabet, Meta and Pinterest have lost between 30% and 60%. Twitter, however, has gained 21% on the prospect of billionaire Musk buying the company.

""We now believe that Snap will have difficulty remaining under control of its own destiny over the next six to nine months,"" MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni said.

WASHINGTON, June 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday asked President Joe Biden's administration to weigh in on whether the justices should hear a case on whether Meta Platforms Inc's (FB.O) WhatsApp can pursue a lawsuit accusing Israel's NSO Group of exploiting a bug in the messaging app to install spy software.

The justices are considering NSO's appeal of a lower court's decision allowing the lawsuit to move forward. NSO has argued that it is immune from being sued because it was acting as an agent for unidentified foreign governments when it installed the ""Pegasus"" spyware.

WhatsApp has said the software was used for the surveillance of 1,400 people, including journalists, human rights activists and dissidents.

The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Justice Department to file a brief offering its views on the legal issue.

Meta Platforms is the parent of WhatsApp and Facebook and was known as Facebook Inc when the suit was filed. WhatsApp in October 2019 sued NSO seeking an injunction and damages, accusing it of accessing WhatsApp servers without permission six months earlier to install the Pegasus software on the targeted people's mobile devices. NSO has argued that Pegasus helps law enforcement and intelligence agencies fight crime and protect national security.

NSO appealed a trial judge's July 2020 refusal to award it ""conduct-based immunity,"" a common-law doctrine protecting foreign officials acting in their official capacity.

Upholding that ruling last November, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals called it an ""easy case"" because NSO's mere licensing of Pegasus and offering technical support did not shield it from liability under a federal law called the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which took precedence over common law.

294,META,2023-02-17,"VR firm Pico, owned by Chinese TikTok maker ByteDance, announces 'small' layoffs","













HONG KONG, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Pico, a virtual reality (VR) headset manufacturer owned by TikTok's Chinese developer ByteDance, said on Friday it was laying off a small number of people, after local media reported the start of hundreds of redundancies earlier this week.

The South China Morning Post reported unidentified sources on Thursday as saying Pico had trimmed some teams by as much as 30%.

""While we continue to hire as a business globally, we are streamlining our team and, as a result, parting ways with a small number of colleagues,"" a Pico spokesperson said in a statement.

""We greatly appreciate these colleagues' contributions and are working closely with those impacted to support them through this time of change.""

Over 200 employees were affected, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.

ByteDance bought Pico in 2021 in a deal widely interpreted as a bet on the metaverse concept of virtual worlds, putting the tech giant in competition with U.S. social media firm Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) which has its own VR devices.

The layoffs mark the latest streamlining for ByteDance, which like many tech peers in China has cut jobs since last year and undergone restructuring as economic growth slows.

On Thursday, Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) said it was making some personnel adjustments after local media reported the Chinese gaming and social media major was laying off staff in its recently formed ""extended reality"" (XR) business.

296,META,2022-11-18,Zuckerberg says WhatsApp business chat will drive sales sooner than metaverse,"













Nov 17 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told employees on Thursday that WhatsApp and Messenger would drive the company's next wave of sales growth, as he sought to assuage concerns about Meta's finances after its first mass layoffs.

Zuckerberg, addressing pointed questions at a company-wide meeting a week after Meta said it would lay off 11,000 workers, described the pair of messaging apps as being ""very early in monetizing"" compared to its advertising juggernauts Facebook and Instagram, according to remarks heard by Reuters.

""We talk a lot about the very long-term opportunities like the metaverse, but the reality is that business messaging is probably going to be the next major pillar of our business as we work to monetize WhatsApp and Messenger more,"" he said.

Meta enables some consumers to speak and transact with merchants through the chat apps, including a new feature announced Thursday in Brazil. read more

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday's internal forum.

Zuckerberg's comments there reflect a shift in tone and emphasis after focusing heavily on extended reality hardware and software investments since announcing a long-term ambition to build out an immersive metaverse last year.

Investors have questioned the wisdom of that decision as Meta's core advertising business has struggled this year, more than halving its stock price.

In his remarks to employees, Zuckerberg played down how much the company was spending in Reality Labs, the unit responsible for its metaverse investments.

People were Meta's biggest expense, followed by capital expenditure, the vast majority of which went to infrastructure to support its suite of social media apps, he said. About 20% of Meta's budget was going to Reality Labs.

Within Reality Labs, the unit was spending over half of its budget on augmented reality (AR), with smart glasses products continuing to emerge ""over the next few years"" and some ""truly great"" AR glasses later in the decade, Zuckerberg said.

""This is in some ways is the most challenging work ... but I also think it's the most valuable potential part of the work over time,"" he said.

About 40% of Reality Labs' budget went toward virtual reality, while about 10% was spent on futuristic social platforms such as the virtual world it calls Horizon.

Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth, who runs Reality Labs, said AR glasses need to be more useful than mobile phones to appeal to potential customers and meet a higher bar for attractiveness.

Bosworth said he was wary of developing ""industrial applications"" for the devices, describing that as ""niche,"" and wanted to stay focused on building for a broad audience.

ABUJA, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Nigeria has asked Google (GOOGL.O) and Meta (META.O) to control the spread of fake news on their platforms ahead of a presidential election this month, Information Minister Lai Mohammed said on Friday.

Nigerians go to the polls on Feb. 25 to elect a new president, with three frontrunners promising to deal with the rising cost of living, insecurity and a slow-growing economy.

Mohammed said he met with Meta and Google representatives in Abuja on Friday and requested that they make posts from official channels visible on their platforms, and flag as unverified election results originating from unofficial sources.

He also asked the two companies to work with the security services to take down posts capable of inciting violence.

Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, has been exploring ways to regulate social media usage. The country is home to millions of internet users and platforms like YouTube, Twitter , Facebook and Tiktok are popular.

Mohammed's request comes after he asked Google last year to block the use of YouTube channels and livestreams by secessionist and Islamist militant groups in the country.

""These actions, if executed, will go a long way in checking the proliferation of fake news and disinformation on social media ahead of, during and after the elections,"" Mohammed said.

A Google representative at the meeting, Dawn Dimowo, said Google had trained about 6,000 journalists in addition to engaging and expanding the scope of fact-checking platforms such as Dubawa to identify and flag fake news.

Meta's Head of Anglophone West Africa, Adaora Ikenze, said the organization has set up an election protection operating centre with 60-80 people working round-the-clock to ensure its platforms are not used to discredit the election.

298,META,2022-04-20,U.S. lawmakers urge Facebook to do more to fight Russia propaganda in Spanish,"













WASHINGTON, April 20 (Reuters) - A group of 21 U.S. lawmakers sent a letter to Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday voicing concern about what they called disinformation on the platform aimed at Spanish speakers about Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The disinformation is spread by Moscow-backed outlets like RT en Espanol, among others, said the letter joined by Senators Amy Klobuchar and Ben Ray Lujan and Representative Tony Cardenas and 18 others.

""Facebook has continuously failed to show it is adequately addressing this problem for Spanish-speaking communities, and the success of Russian sponsored outlets in crowding out the information ecosystem for Spanish speakers serves as proof to this fact,"" the lawmakers wrote.

""The viral spread of these narratives stands in stark contrast to assurances that Meta made to the public and Members of Congress that it is prioritizing the pressing needs of Hispanic communities in the United States,"" the letter said.

Facebook, now called Meta Platforms (FB.O), said in a statement that it was working to stop disinformation in Spanish.

""We're removing content related to the war in Ukraine that violates our policies, and working with third-party fact checkers to debunk false claims. When they rate something as false, we move this content lower in feed so fewer people see it,"" said spokesman Kevin McAlister, who said that the company was also ""applying labels to state-controlled media publishers, including ones cited in the letter.""

The letter was signed by seven senators and 14 representatives, many of them from states like California and New York with significant Spanish-speaking populations.

299,META,2023-02-20,$3.7 bln UK mass action against Facebook over market dominance rejected - for now,"













LONDON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Facebook on Monday temporarily fought off a collective lawsuit valued at up to 3 billion pounds ($3.7 billion) over allegations the social media giant abused its dominant position to monetise users' personal data.

However, a London tribunal gave the proposed claimants' lawyers up to six months to ""have another go"" at establishing any alleged losses by users.

Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), the parent company of the Facebook group, faces a mass action brought on behalf of around 45 million Facebook users in Britain.

Legal academic Liza Lovdahl Gormsen, who is bringing the case, says Facebook users were not properly compensated for the value of personal data they had to provide to use the platform.

Her lawyers last month asked the Competition Appeal Tribunal to certify the case under the UK's collective proceedings regime – which is roughly equivalent to the class action regime in the United States.

But the Tribunal ruled on Monday that Lovdahl Gormsen's methodology of establishing any losses suffered by Facebook users needed ""root-and-branch re-evaluation"" for the case to continue.

Judge Marcus Smith did, however, give Lovdahl Gormsen's lawyers six months to ""file additional evidence setting out a new and better blueprint leading to an effective trial"".

A spokesperson for Meta said the company welcomed the decision and referred to its previous statement that the lawsuit is ""entirely without merit"".

A spokesperson for Lovdahl Gormsen declined to comment.

300,META,2022-05-02,EU's Vestager assessing if tech giants should share telecoms network costs,"













BRUSSELS, May 2 (Reuters) - Tech giants such as Google (GOOGL.O), Meta (FB.O) and Netflix (NFLX.O) may have to bear some of the cost of Europe's telecoms network, Europe's digital chief Margrethe Vestager said on Monday, following EU telecoms operators' complaints.

""I think there is an issue that we need to consider with a lot of focus, and that is the issue of fair contribution to telecommunication networks,"" Vestager told a news conference.

""Because we see that there are players who generate a lot of traffic that then enables their business but who have not been contributing actually to enable that traffic. They have not been contributing to enabling the investments in the rollout of connectivity,"" she said.

""And we are in the process of getting a thorough understanding of how could that be enabled,"" Vestager said, adding that she was looking into how data traffic evolves over time and that related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to a study released by telecoms lobbying group ETNO on Monday, Meta, Alphabet, Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Netflix accounted for over 56% of all global data traffic last year.

The study said an annual contribution of 20 billion euros ($21 billion) to network costs by the tech giants could give a 72-billion-euro boost to the EU economy. ETNO's members include Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) and Orange (ORAN.PA).

Vestager, however, gave short shrift to the telecoms industry's calls to loosen EU merger rules to allow more consolidation.

""The problem is that the arguments that we hear, like the need for scale in order to invest, they are not new,"" she said.

NAIROBI, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Kenya has no intention of shutting down Facebook, which is owned by Meta (META.O), its ICT minister said on Monday after the national cohesion watchdog gave the platform seven days to comply with rules on hate speech or face suspension.

The National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) on Friday accused Facebook of contravening Kenya's constitution and laws for failing to tackle hate speech and incitement on the platform ahead of Aug. 9 national elections. read more

""We do not have a plan to shut down any of these platforms,"" Joe Mucheru, the minister for information, communication and technology, told Reuters. ""Press freedom is one we cherish, whether it is (traditional) media or social media.""

His statement echoed that of the interior minister, Fred Matiangi, who accused the NCIC of making haphazard decisions over the weekend, and vowed that the platform will not be shut down.

""They (NCIC) should have consulted widely because they don't have the power to shut anybody down. They don't licence anybody,"" Mucheru said.

When it issued its ultimatum, the NCIC said it was consulting with the Communication Authority of Kenya, which regulates the industry, adding that it would recommend suspension of Facebook's operations if it does not comply.

Meta has taken ""extensive steps"" to weed out hate speech and inflammatory content, and it is intensifying those efforts ahead of the election, a company spokesperson told Reuters.

Mucheru agreed, adding that the platform has deleted 37,000 hate speech related posts during the electioneering period.

Supporters of the leading presidential candidates, veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga and deputy president William Ruto, have used social media platforms to praise their candidates, persuade others to join them or to accuse opposing sides of various misdeeds.

Some of Kenya's 45 tribes have targeted each other during violence in past polls, but Mucheru said this election is different and the country is enjoying peace and calm in spite of the heightened political activities.

302,META,2023-02-10,"Facebook, Gibson Dunn sanction order is light on dollars, heavy on message","Companies

Companies Law firms Meta Platforms Inc Follow















Feb 10 (Reuters) - To Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and its lawyers at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, $925,000 isn't a whole lot of money.

You might even say that a million bucks, give or take, is nothing more than ""loose change"" to a company whose annual earnings topped $115 billion last year and to a law firm that reportedly grosses more than $2 billion annually.

""Loose change,"" in fact, is how U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria of San Francisco described the $925,000 sanction he levied against Meta and Gibson Dunn on Thursday in a class action accusing the social media company of harvesting and sharing users’ personal data without their knowledge or consent. Chhabria, as you've probably heard, ordered Facebook and its lawyers to pay that sum to plaintiffs' lawyers as recompense for their bad-faith litigation tactics.

Even in the context of just this case, which Facebook agreed late last year to settle for $725 million, a $925,000 sanction – which is less than half of the $2 million requested by plaintiffs' lawyers -- hardly rates an asterisk.

But money wasn’t the point of Chhabria’s order.

The judge wanted to make an example of Facebook and its law firm to draw attention to what he considers to be a frequent problem in big cases: corporations and their lawyers using delay and obfuscation to wear down plaintiffs' lawyers on the other side.

Chhabria's message comes through most clearly near the end of the opinion, after the judge expended pages and pages detailing the many ways in which Facebook contested discovery requests from lead plaintiffs' lawyers at Keller Rohrback and Bleichmar Fonti & Auld.

""Does anyone really think that Facebook was planning on taking this case to trial?"" the judge wrote. ""Or was Facebook, with the assistance of its lawyers, executing a different play from the playbook: resist discovery as long as possible, make things increasingly difficult and expensive and frustrating for the opposition, and hope that would drive down the case’s settlement value? This is, by far, the most likely explanation for Facebook and Gibson Dunn’s conduct.""

Some context is in order. Discovery in the case was so complex and contentious that the U.S. magistrate judge who oversaw it urged both sides to engage a special master. And as I’ve previously told you during the year-long sanctions saga, after Chhabria first threatened Facebook and Gibson Dunn last February, the law firm has offered rationales and justifications for all of the discovery disputes in case. Gibson Dunn has insisted throughout that although the firm and its client litigated “zealously” as plaintiffs fished for a viable theory, they never violated a discovery order or failed to abide by instructions from the magistrate and special master. (It’s also worth pointing out that discovery had not yet closed when the two sides announced their settlement last year.)

Chhabria noted those arguments by Facebook and its lawyers, even acknowledging a ruling from the magistrate judge that rejected plaintiffs’ accusations of bad faith litigation to prolong one of many discovery fights. But the judge also stepped back from the minutiae of the battles over particular categories of evidence to look more broadly at Facebook’s litigation strategy.

What he saw, he said, was all too familiar: A big corporation and its high-priced lawyers pushed the outer limits of the discovery process with the goal of forcing plaintiffs' lawyers to accept a discounted settlement offer just to end the misery of fighting endless discovery disputes.

“This is not to suggest that there necessarily was some back-room meeting at which Facebook and its lawyers said, ‘Ok, here’s the plan, let’s be as unreasonable and obstructionist as possible in the hope that we’ll frustrate the plaintiffs into settling for less than they could get if we were cooperative in discovery,’” Chhabria wrote. “Unfortunately, this approach to litigation is common enough that no such meeting was necessary. Facebook and its lawyers fell into their roles with ease, and then they took things way too far.”

Gibson Dunn and Meta both declined to provide a statement on Chhabria’s order.

Chhabria took pains to emphasize that the problem in this case was not thoughtless or incompetent advocacy. Quite to the contrary. In his view, Facebook and Gibson Dunn’s self-described zealousness was instead “a sustained, concerted, bad-faith effort to throw obstacle after obstacle in front of the plaintiffs—all in an attempt to push the plaintiffs into settling the case for less than they would have gotten otherwise.”

Chhabria delivered his reprimand on corporate litigation tactics with writing that’s irresistibly quotable, accusing Facebook and Gibson Dunn in the very first sentence of the order of “using delay, misdirection, and frivolous arguments to make litigation unfairly difficult and expensive for their opponents.”

Later in the opinion, in addressing Gibson Dunn’s assertion that class counsel were to blame for discovery delays, the judge offered a seething refutation: “No matter the conduct of the opposing party, counsel cannot twist their words—not to mention the words of the court—in support of frivolous arguments. They cannot resist the disclosure of obviously discoverable information. They cannot ignore potential sources of evidence, only for opposing counsel to learn about those sources at a … deposition near the close of discovery. They cannot treat depositions like fighting matches. And they cannot encourage their client’s obstinance.”

A relatively small monetary sanction is no salve for the sting of language like that – as Chhabria surely knows. If you are a corporate defendant or defense lawyer appearing in his courtroom, consider yourself warned.

Feb 8 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) investors formally asked a U.S. appeals court to revive a proposed class action accusing the Facebook parent of concealing a serious privacy breach that let a political consulting firm harvest users' personal information.

The request came during oral arguments on Wednesday before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco over the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where data for up to 87 million users was accessed.

Investors claimed that Facebook, as the company was known, misled them in 2016 by describing data breaches as a mere ""risk,"" when it knew that Cambridge had accessed user data.

The investors said they incurred losses in July 2018 when Facebook's share price fell after the company said user growth slowed after the magnitude of the breach became public.

U.S. District Judge Edward Davila ruled in 2020 that Facebook's statements were not false because Cambridge's data use had been in the news in 2015.

In Wednesday's hearing, the investors' lawyer Tom Goldstein told a three-judge panel that Davila's ruling should be reversed because Facebook had downplayed the news reports and not taken strong action.

Meta's lawyer Joshua Lipshutz countered that the company had adequately disclosed that cyberattacks had occurred and would occur in the future.

Circuit Judges Margaret McKeown and Jay Bybee appeared skeptical, calling those disclosures ""boilerplate"" and suggesting they might not be meaningful to investors.

""If they have one incident of phishing by some 18-year-old sitting in his parent's basement it's true,"" Bybee said. ""But it's not helpful considering the nature of the leak to Cambridge.""

Lipshutz replied that even if there were misstatements, investors must still show Meta had wrongful intent.

""It's not plausible that the company was trying to mislead the public about something the public already knew,"" he said.

Facebook paid more than $5 billion in penalties to U.S. authorities over Cambridge Analytica. It agreed to pay $725 million to settle a lawsuit by Facebook users in December.

Summary Law firms

Law firms Related documents CEO Mark Zuckerberg and departing COO Sheryl Sandberg due to sit for hours of questions

Underlying lawsuit alleges company shared user data illegally, including with Cambridge Analytica















(Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg and outgoing chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg are set to answer attorney questions as part of San Francisco federal court litigation over the Cambridge Analytica data sharing scandal, according to a new court filing.

Lawyers for both plaintiffs and Meta-owned Facebook have agreed that the plaintiffs' attorneys can depose Zuckerberg for six hours and Sandberg for five hours as part of the data privacy lawsuit, according to a joint filing late Tuesday.

The parties have also agreed that plaintiffs can question Javier Olivan, the company's chief growth officer who will replace Sandberg as COO, for three hours, according to the court document.

There are depositions in the case scheduled through Sept. 20, the filing said.

A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment and the company's outside lawyers from Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for the plaintiffs at Keller Rohrback and Bleichmar Fonti & Auld declined to comment.

The four-year-old proposed class action alleges Facebook violated consumer privacy laws by sharing users' personal data with now-defunct British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica and others.

Facebook has said of the underlying lawsuit that its privacy practices are consistent with its disclosures and “do not support any legal claims.”

The Tuesday case management statement from the parties comes amid long-running discovery marred by plaintiffs' allegations of litigation misconduct.

The plaintiffs' lawyers recently filed a sanctions motion seeking $854,000 in fees and costs from Facebook, Gibson Dunn and the firm's lead partner in the case, Orin Snyder. The company and firm in a response filing said there has been no sanctionable conduct.

At least one other recent plaintiffs' effort to force Zuckerberg to answer attorney questions tied to the Cambridge Analytica scandal failed.

The D.C. attorney general's office, in its own lawsuit against the social media company, sought to question Zuckerberg about Facebook's data privacy practices. Facebook's lawyers argued the District's effort was a ""transparent attempt to harass."" A D.C. superior court judge in March rejected the bid.

The case is In re Facebook Inc., Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 3:18-md-02843

For the plaintiffs: Derek Loeser of Keller Rohrback; and Lesley Weaver of Bleichmar Fonti & Auld

For Facebook: Orin Snyder and Deborah Stein of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher

WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday let Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) WhatsApp pursue a lawsuit accusing Israel's NSO Group of exploiting a bug in the WhatsApp messaging app to install spy software allowing the surveillance of 1,400 people, including journalists, human rights activists and dissidents.

The justices turned away NSO's appeal of a lower court's decision that the lawsuit could move forward. NSO had argued that it is immune from being sued because it was acting as an agent for unidentified foreign governments when it installed the ""Pegasus"" spyware.

President Joe Biden's administration had urged the justices to reject NSO's appeal, noting that the U.S. State Department had never before recognized a private entity acting as an agent of a foreign state as being entitled to immunity.

Meta, the parent company of both WhatsApp and Facebook, in a statement welcomed the court's move to turn away NSO's ""baseless"" appeal.

""NSO's spyware has enabled cyberattacks targeting human rights activists, journalists and government officials,"" Meta said. ""We firmly believe that their operations violate U.S. law and they must be held to account for their unlawful operations.""

A lawyer for NSO did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

WhatsApp in 2019 sued NSO seeking an injunction and damages, accusing it of accessing WhatsApp servers without permission six months earlier to install the Pegasus software on victims' mobile devices.

NSO has argued that Pegasus helps law enforcement and intelligence agencies fight crime and protect national security and that its technology is intended to help catch terrorists, pedophiles and hardened criminals.

In court papers, NSO said that WhatsApp's notification to users scuttled a foreign government's investigation into an Islamic State militant who was using the app to plan an attack.

In one notorious case, NSO spyware was used - allegedly by the Saudi government - to target the inner circle of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi shortly before he was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.

NSO appealed a trial judge's 2020 refusal to award it ""conduct-based immunity,"" a common law doctrine protecting foreign officials acting in their official capacity.

Upholding that ruling in 2021, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals called it an ""easy case"" because NSO's mere licensing of Pegasus and offering technical support did not shield it from liability under a federal law called the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which took precedence over common law.

WhatsApp's lawyers said that private entities like NSO are ""categorically ineligible"" for foreign sovereign immunity.

The Biden administration in a filing in November said the 9th Circuit reached the right result, even though the government was not ready to endorse the circuit court's conclusion that FSIA entirely forecloses any form of immunity under common law.

According to court papers, the accounts of 1,400 WhatsApp users were accessed using the Pegasus tracking software, secretly using their smartphones as surveillance devices.

An investigation published in 2021 by 17 media organizations, led by the Paris-based non-profit journalism group Forbidden Stories, found that the spyware had been used in attempted and successful hacks of smartphones belonging to journalists, government officials and human rights activists on a global scale.

The U.S. government in November 2021 blacklisted NSO and Israel's Candiru, accusing them of providing spyware to governments that used it to ""maliciously target"" journalists, activists and others.

NSO also is being sued by iPhone maker Apple Inc (AAPL.O), accused of violating its user terms and services agreement.

Summary Companies Meta climbs after report of more layoffs

Fidelity National slumps on payments business spinoff

Tech-related heavyweights drive S&P 500 gains

Indexes rally: S&P 500 +1.15%, Nasdaq +1.48%, Dow +1.11%















Feb 13 (Reuters) - Wall Street closed sharply higher on Monday as investors awaited inflation data likely to hint at the path of the Federal Reserve's future interest rate hikes, while Meta Platforms gained after a report that the Facebook parent was planning fresh layoffs.

Meta (META.O) jumped about 3% after the Financial Times reported on Sunday that the company was preparing to announce a new round of job cuts, adding to layoffs last November.

Microsoft (MSFT.O) rose more than 3%, Nvidia (NVDA.O) gained 2.5%, and Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) each rose over 1%. Along with Meta, those tech-related heavyweights contributed more than any other stocks to the S&P 500's gains during a trading session that saw light volume.

Helping lift Microsoft, Stifel raised its price target on the software company and said it is clearly looking to upend Alphabet's Google search dominance through its integration with ChatGPT.

Investors are laser-focused on January inflation data due on Tuesday to reassess their bets on the central bank's monetary policy path.

Wall Street's main indexes lost ground last week after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that interest rates may need to move higher than expected in the central bank's battle against inflation.

""Today is just a natural reaction in the opposite direction after we've seen very heavy selling pressure,"" said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments in Atlanta.

Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes rose, led by information technology (.SPLRCT), up 1.77%, followed by a 1.46% gain in consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD). The energy index (.SPNY) dipped 0.6%.

The S&P 500 climbed 1.15% to end the session at 4,137.32 points.

The Nasdaq gained 1.48% to 11,891.79 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.11% to 34,246.13 points.

However, volume on U.S. exchanges was relatively light, with 9.5 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 11.9 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.

So far in this year, the S&P 500 has gained about 8%, and the index remains down about 14% from its record high close in January 2022.

Fidelity National Information Services Inc (FIS.N) plunged 12.5% following the banking and payments processing conglomerate's decision to spin off its merchant payments business.

Coca-Cola (KO.N) rose 1.6% ahead of its quarterly report due out early on Tuesday.

As U.S. quarterly earnings reports wind down, 69% of the S&P 500 firms that have reported results so far have exceeded profit expectations, according to Refinitiv data. Analysts expect December-quarter earnings to have fallen nearly 3% from a year earlier.

Across the U.S. stock market (.AD.US), advancing stocks outnumbered falling ones by a 2.5-to-one ratio.

The S&P 500 posted four new highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 80 new highs and 59 new lows.

307,META,2022-12-02,Australia says law making Facebook and Google pay for news has worked,"













SYDNEY, Dec 2 (Reuters) - An Australian law giving the government power to make internet giants Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O) and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google negotiate content supply deals with media outlets has largely worked, a government report said.

But the law, which took effect in March 2021 after talks with the big tech firms led to a brief shutdown of Facebook news feeds in the country, may need to be extended to other online platforms, the review said.

Since the News Media Bargaining Code took effect, the tech firms had inked more than 30 deals with media outlets compensating them for content which generated clicks and advertising dollars, said the Treasury department report, published late Thursday.

""At least some of these agreements have enabled news businesses to, in particular, employ additional journalists and make other valuable investments to assist their operations,"" said the report.

""While views on the success or otherwise of the Code will invariably differ, we consider it is reasonable to conclude that the Code has been a success to date.""

The report mostly recommended that the government consider new methods of assessing the administration and effectiveness of the law, and did not suggest changing the law itself.

But it did note the law lacked ""a formal mechanism to extend the Code to other platforms"", and suggested the government order the competition regulator, which led the design of the law, to ""prepare reports on this question"".

""The review shows the Code has been successful balancing bargaining power between news media and digital platforms,"" said Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones.

""Digital platforms must continue to negotiate in good faith with news businesses to ensure they are fairly remunerated for the news content they create.""

Google director of government affairs and public policy in Australia Lucinda Longcroft said the company had ""furthered our significant contribution to the Australian news industry"" by signing deals representing 200 mastheads across the country and ""the majority of these outlets are regional or local"".

Meta declined to comment.

May 6 (Reuters) - Investment bank Jefferies Financial Group Inc (JEF.N) said on Friday the Instagram account of its Chief Executive Officer Rich Handler had been hacked.

""Any stories related to discounted sales of shares, crypto donations or donations to Ukraine ... that appear on that hacked Instagram account are categorically false,"" Jefferies said.

Jefferies said it was working with Instagram-owner Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) to get back control of the social media account.

Handler is a prolific user of the social media platform, and has used his Instagram account to post updates on the bank's return to office policies in the past.

310,META,2022-11-17,Meta's WhatsApp makes Brazil a key test market for business messaging,"













Nov 17 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms (META.O) said on Thursday its WhatsApp messaging service will introduce a commercial directory and test a payments tool in Brazil, as it bets on business messaging as a potential fresh source of revenue.

Brazil, one of the app's biggest markets, will be the first country to see the new tools deployed outside pilot programmes.

""The ultimate goal here is to make it so you can find, message and buy from a business all in the same WhatsApp chat,"" Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a video shown at a WhatsApp summit in Sao Paolo.

The directory will allow users to find companies with business messaging accounts on WhatsApp, enabling easier access to customer service chats, Meta said in a blog post.

Users previously needed to add a phone number to their contacts or click a link on a separate platform to open a chat with a business. The company started testing the directory in Sao Paolo last year.

loading

The directory service will be introduced in Indonesia, Mexico, Colombia and the United Kingdom as well via WhatsApp's API, which mainly serves large businesses.

Partnering with local companies, WhatsApp will also test a payments tool in Brazil that would make in-app transactions possible with credit or debit cards.

A spokesperson for WhatsApp declined to disclose fee arrangements with the payments firms.

WhatsApp, the social media giant's biggest app in terms of daily users, piloted the end-to-end shopping model with Indian online grocery service JioMart over the summer.

Aside from JioMart, currently only personal payments can be sent on WhatsApp and only in India and Brazil.

Boosting business messaging has assumed greater urgency this year as Meta's core advertising business has stalled. The company experienced its first-ever annual revenue declines and last week laid off 11,000 employees.

Despite WhatsApp's popularity, and its eye-popping $22 billion acquisition price tag in 2014, to date it has contributed only a sliver to Meta's total revenue.

March 29 (Reuters) - Russia's communications regulator on Tuesday said it had drawn up two administrative cases against Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google for failing to remove banned information from its YouTube video-sharing platform, accusing it of blatantly promoting false content.

Roskomnadzor said Google could be fined up to 8 million roubles ($91,533), or as much as 20% of the company's annual revenue in Russia for repeat offences.

It said YouTube had become one of the key platforms in the ""information war"" against Russia.

Google did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

Russia has restricted access to Twitter (TWTR.N) and Meta Platforms' (FB.O) flagship Facebook and Instagram services since sending troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, as a simmering dispute with U.S. technology giants has escalated into a battle to control information flows.

YouTube, which has blocked Russian state-funded media globally, is under heavy pressure from Moscow, which earlier this month accused it of spreading what it called threats against Russian citizens. read more

""The American platform openly enables the spread of false content, containing inaccurate publicly significant information about the course of the special military operation in Ukraine, discrediting the armed forces of the Russian Federation, as well as information of an extremist nature with calls for violence against Russian servicemen,"" Roskomnadzor said.

Russia last week said Meta was guilty of ""extremist activity"", something the company's lawyer denied in a Moscow court. read more

Russia launched what it calls a special operation in Ukraine to degrade its neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists.

Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in response.

Summary Companies This content was produced in Russia where the law restricts coverage of Russian military operations in Ukraine















MOSCOW, Oct 19 (Reuters) - A Russian lawmaker on Wednesday urged state institutions to stop using WhatsApp messenger and the industry ministry sought to promote domestically produced software as Russia tries to wean itself off Western technology.

WhatsApp owner Meta Platforms Inc. (META.O) was found guilty of ""extremist activity"" in Russia in March and later added to financial monitoring agency Rosfinmonitoring's list of ""terrorists and extremists"". Meta's lawyer in court has said Meta was not carrying out extremist activity and was against Russophobia.

Russia blocked Meta's Facebook and Instagram in March, objecting to restrictions on Russian media and some posts permitted by users in Ukraine.

Widely used among Russians, WhatsApp has always remained available, but Anton Gorelkin, deputy head of the Russian parliament's committee on information policy, on Wednesday said he personally would be deleting the app and recommended a wider ban.

""I think it is necessary to introduce a full ban on WhatsApp use for official purposes by the Russian state and municipal employees,"" Gorelkin wrote on Telegram, an alternative messenger that is very popular in Russia.

""Whether it is a Russian alternative or from Dubai does not matter - the main thing is that it does not belong to a company that openly participates in the information war against our country and is included on the list of terrorist and extremist organisations.""

Russia has acknowledged major shortcomings with its electronics industry. As Western sanctions and an exodus of foreign firms stymie its access to technology imports and solutions, Moscow has sought to boost the industry with tax breaks and preferential loans.

Vasily Shpak, deputy industry and trade minister, said the niche vacated by foreign telecoms manufacturers should be filled by domestic ones.

""There will be no going back,"" Interfax news agency quoted Shpak as saying, adding that firms exiting the country must not be allowed to return to the same niches they have vacated.

""This niche should be filled by our producers,"" Shpak said, calling for electronics products with domestic software to form the ""basis of Russia's technological independence"".

July 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street is bracing for the slowest global revenue growth in the history of the social media sector, as intensifying competition from TikTok and Apple in advertising threaten to compound economic woes in the second quarter.

The dour expectations come after a blowout 2021, when social media ad sales in the United States grew 36% to reach $58 billion as brands increased marketing budgets to recover from the pandemic and reach customers online.

But social media platforms have since warned investors and employees that the tide is turning as inflation lingers around 40-year highs, an environment where brands spend less on advertising.

Meta Platforms (META.O) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told employees last month the company was slashing hiring plans and that ""this might be one of the worst downturns that we've seen in recent history."" read more

Snap Inc (SNAP.N), which owns Snapchat and is due to report earnings after the close, earlier said it expected to miss its own quarterly revenue forecast due to deteriorating economic conditions. read more

Global social media ad sales are now expected to grow by 11%, the slowest pace on record, according to media intelligence firm MAGNA, which downgraded the growth forecast from 18%.

Analysts had expected some degree of slowing growth after 2021. However, growing competition from viral short-form video app TikTok and Apple has created a ""perfect storm"" and ""investors are rightfully wary"" about digital ad growth this year, wrote Barclays analysts in a research note this month.

Apple had already upended the digital ad industry when it introduced new iPhone privacy controls last year that hurt the ability for companies like Meta and Snap to target and measure ads on their apps.

Apple's own advertising business, which mostly consists of developers paying to promote their app on the App Store, is expected to grow 36% this year to $6.9 billion, Barclays wrote, adding that Apple and TikTok together will take 34% of every new ad dollar that is spent outside China this year.

Lior Eldan, chief operating officer of mobile app marketing agency Moburst, which has worked with brands like Uber and Reddit, said clients are now spending about two to three times more on Apple ads, in part because the effectiveness of ads on other platforms has been degraded by Apple's privacy changes.

""We've seen dramatic increases in budgets on Apple search ads following the privacy changes,"" he said.

While still much smaller than behemoths like Facebook and YouTube, TikTok is poised to grow over 200% to become a $12 billion business, Barclays wrote.

TikTok remains important for many clients' advertising strategies, said Yvonne Williams, vice president of media at ad agency Code3, which has worked with brands like Gap and Dior.

Alphabet's Google, which reports second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, is the company most likely to be shielded from negative effects, because Google Search is ""mission critical"" for many advertisers, analysts from RBC Capital Markets said in a note on Tuesday.

Meta, Snap and Pinterest are more exposed to the Apple privacy changes and competition from TikTok, Barclays said.

Jordan is a leading member of the House Freedom Caucus. February 8, 2023. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein/File Photo/File Photo















WASHINGTON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - U.S. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan on Wednesday subpoenaed the chief executives of Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms (META.O), and Microsoft (MSFT.O) for documents and communications relating to free-speech issues.

Jordan and other conservatives accused the companies of suppressing conservative speech during the Trump administration, and expanded that accusation to include colluding with the Biden administration once he won the White House. The White House and major tech companies have rejected the allegation.

""These subpoenas are the first step in holding Big Tech accountable,"" Jordan's office said in a statement.

Microsoft and Meta said that they had already begun producing documents. Microsoft said it was ""engaged with the Committee, and committed to working in good faith."" None of the other three companies responded to a request for comment.

The subpoenas, sent to Alphabet's Sundar Pichai, Andy Jassy of Amazon.com, Tim Cook of Apple, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, and Satya Nadella of Microsoft, demand documents and communications related to alleged collusion between the government and the companies to stifle free speech.

Jordan set a March 23 deadline to turn over documents.

Republicans who took control of the House of Representatives in January after narrowly winning control in the November elections have made questions about Big Tech a top focus and created a Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government.

Last week, the panel held its first hearing into Republican claims that the Justice Department and FBI show anti-conservative bias, a move made following the FBI's discovery of hundreds of classified documents at Republican former President Donald Trump's Florida resort.

Jordan wrote related letters to the companies in December, making similar demands to big tech but this was when the House was in Democratic hands and before he became chair. Jordan's office said that the companies did not adequately comply.

BENGALURU, Sept 22 (Reuters) - The head of WhatsApp's India payment business, Manesh Mahatme, has quit after more than a year with the Meta Platforms-owned (META.O) company to join Amazon India, a source told Reuters on Thursday.

Mahatme's exit comes at a critical time for Whatsapp, which is seeking to ramp up its payments service in a highly competitive market and lock horns with more established payers such as Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google Pay, Ant Group-backed Paytm (PAYT.NS) and Walmart's (WMT.N) PhonePe.

During his stint at WhatsApp Pay, the company won regulatory approval to more than double its payments offering to 100 million users in India, its biggest market with more than half a billion users overall. read more

Mahatme has joined as director of product in the e-commerce division of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) in India, the source said.

He joined WhatsApp Pay in April 2021. Mahatme was previously on the board of Amazon Pay India between 2014 and 2021, according to his LinkedIn profile.

WhatsApp in a statement said Mahatme played an important role in expanding access to WhatsApp payments in India, adding the payments service was a ""a priority for Meta and we will continue to innovate and drive momentum as part of our broader efforts.""

Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.

WhatsApp rolled out cashback rewards this year to lure more Indians to its peer-to-peer payments service, even though the regulatory caps on number of users that can use its service meant it continues to face stiff competition from rivals.

GENEVA, Sept 12 (Reuters) - The head of a U.N. team of investigators on Myanmar said on Monday that Facebook has handed over millions of items that could support allegations of war crimes and genocide.

The Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (IIMM) aims to build case files for proceedings in national, regional or international courts. It was established in 2018 by the U.N. Human Rights Council and began work the following year.

""Facebook has shared with the mechanism millions of items from networks of accounts that were taken down by the company because they misrepresented their identity,"" Nicholas Koumjian, head of the IIMM, said in a speech to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.

Myanmar is facing charges of genocide at the UN's International Court of Justice (ICJ) over a 2017 military crackdown on the Rohingya that forced more than 730,000 people to flee into neighboring Bangladesh.

Facebook, whose parent company changed its name to Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) last year, said that they support international efforts for accountability for the crimes committed against the Rohingya.

""(We) have made voluntary, lawful disclosures to the U.N.'s investigative mechanism as well as disclosures of public information to The Gambia"" which has filed the ICJ genocide case, Miranda Sissons, director of human rights policy at Meta, said in an e-mail.

In 2018, U.N. human rights investigators said the social media site had spread hate speech that fueled the violence in Myanmar. Facebook has said it is working to block hate speech.

With the Facebook items and other pieces of information from over 200 sources, the mechanism has prepared 67 ""evidential and analytical packages."" These packages are intended to be shared with judicial authorities, including the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the ICJ, Koumjian added.

The ICC has also opened a case looking at deportation and other crimes against humanity in relation to Rohingya refugees who were forced into ICC member state Bangladesh.

Myanmar denies genocide and says its armed forces were conducting legitimate operations against militants.

REUTERS/Murad Sezer















Sept 21 (Reuters) - Iran curbed access on Wednesday to Meta Platforms' (META.O) Instagram and WhatsApp, two of the last remaining social networks in the country, amid protests over the death of a woman in police custody, residents and internet watchdog NetBlocks said.

Last week's death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was arrested by morality police in Tehran for ""unsuitable attire"", has unleashed anger over issues including freedom in the Islamic Republic and an economy reeling from sanctions. read more

NetBlocks also reported a ""nation-scale loss of connectivity"" on Iran's mail mobile telephone provider and another company's network.

WhatsApp's servers have been disrupted on multiple internet providers, hours after Instagram's services were blocked, London-based NetBlocks said.

The group's data shows a near-total disruption to internet service in parts of Kurdistan province in west Iran since Monday, while the capital city of Tehran and other parts of the country have also faced disruptions since Friday when protests first broke out.

Two residents in Tehran and southern Iran said they could only send text and not pictures on WhatsApp and that Instagram appeared to be completely blocked.

Iran has often curbed internet access to make it difficult for protesters to post videos on social media to generate support and also to obtain reliable reports on the extent of the unrest.

In 2019, the government shut down the internet for about a week to help stifle fuel protests which turned political, sparking the bloodiest crackdown in the 40-year history of the Islamic Republic.

Protests have been particularly intense in Kurdistan where Iran's Revolutionary Guards has a history of suppressing unrest. read more

Iran's minister of communications said earlier on Wednesday he had been misquoted after news outlets cited him as saying the authorities might disrupt internet services for security reasons. read more

Social media websites such as TikTok, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook are routinely blocked in parts of the Islamic Republic, which has some of the strictest internet controls in the world. But tech-savvy residents bypass curbs using virtual private networks (VPNs).

Meta and Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

REUTERS/Nicholas Pfosi/File Photo















BOSTON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Federal investigators are probing whether the employee who reported a package explosion this week at Boston's Northeastern University might have staged the incident, a law enforcement official told Reuters on Wednesday.

Boston police said on Tuesday that a package delivered to the urban campus had exploded while being handled by the 45-year-old employee, who they said suffered hand injuries requiring hospital treatment. The employee has not been named. read more

Northeastern cancelled some classes following the Tuesday incident. Other Boston-area campuses, including Harvard University, urged students to be cautious, stirring emotions in a city still scarred by the deadly 2013 Boston Marathon bombings.

The Boston Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment the law enforcement official's comments, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The Suffolk County district attorney's office, which on Tuesday said it was ready to work with law enforcement on any prosecutions, said federal investigators were taking the lead on the case. It said no one had been federally charged.

The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ABC News, citing unnamed law enforcement sources, said authorities have found no evidence of a detonation and are questioning whether the incident actually took place.

Also citing unnamed law enforcement sources, CNN reported earlier on Wednesday the package contained a note criticizing Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (META.O).

The note also deplored the relationship between virtual reality developers and academia, CNN reported. Boston's WCVB news reported the note was packed into a pressurized container that exploded when it was opened.

Meta did not provide comment on the reports, nor did the Boston Police Department.

The city was rocked by the Boston Marathon bombings of 2013, when three people were killed and more than 260 others wounded by a pair of homemade bombs at the annual race.

A jury in 2015 sentenced Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to death for carrying out the attacks with his older brother, who died several days after the bombing in a gunfight with police.

319,META,2022-08-08,U.S. FTC commissioner Phillips to resign in autumn,"













WASHINGTON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - One of the two Republicans on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) who has dissented in several antitrust actions filed against social media companiessaid on Monday that he will resign later this year.

FTC Commissioner Noah Phillips said in a statement he had written to President Joe Biden announcing his intent to resign this fall.

Phillips, a former chief counsel for Republican Senator John Cornyn, dissented in December 2020 in an FTC antitrust case filed against Facebook, which is now known as Meta Platforms (META.O). He also dissented last month when the FTC sought a court order to block Meta from buying virtual reality (VR) content maker Within Unlimited.

Democrats hold a 3-2 majority on the commission and only three can be from one political party.

The FTC works with the Justice Department to enforce antitrust law and investigates allegations of deceptive behavior by companies.

In April, Phillips said the Biden administration is ""as hostile to mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as any in my lifetime.""

He argued that since President Joe Biden took over antitrust enforcement ""has been anything but vigorous—indeed, it has been sclerotic. By that I mean not just fewer cases being brought, but a longer process with fewer decisions being made.

The White House has made fostering competition a top priority. National Economic Council director Brian Deese said last month Biden believes that ""driving structural change to promote competition across the economy"" will ""generate more innovation, greater productivity, more opportunity in the country while lowering prices.""

Phillips and fellow Republican FTC Commissioner Christine Wilson last year asked the White House to disclose any ""evidence"" of wrongdoing behind high retail gasoline prices after Biden urged the agency to dig deeper into possible ""illegal conduct.""

He said in January he had received no response. He said ""an antitrust investigation predicated on fumes would have wasted resources.""

320,META,2022-10-25,Alphabet properly preps its books for a downturn,"













NEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Alphabet (GOOGL.O) is better prepared than its ad-dependent rivals. The parent of Google reported on Tuesday third-quarter revenue growth slowed to 6% year-over-year to $69 billion, the worst performance since the pandemic. Still, its revenue is more diversified, and it runs leaner than peers. For the company run by Sundar Pichai, a looming downturn will be a little less painful.

Google taps a greater variety of sources for dollars than Meta Platforms (META.O), Twitter (TWTR.N) or Snap (SNAP.N). It sells advertising for both search and video via YouTube, and those sites top Morgan Stanley’s list of criteria including engagement and reach for strength during an economic slide. Unlike Facebook, say, Google is more utilitarian than entertainment. So, in a downturn, its users – and corresponding advertisers – will be stickier. That shows up in Alphabet’s own results: Google’s search revenue for example rose 4%, while for YouTube, sales slipped 2%.

Still, it isn’t resting on its laurels – the business is also relatively lean. The average headcount at Alphabet increased 62% from 2019 to 2022 reckons Bernstein’s analysts. That’s less top heavy than Facebook’s owner or Snap, whose workforces more than doubled.

That explains why Alphabet’s net profit margins have held steady: In the third quarter of 2019 it was 17% versus 20% in the third quarter this year. Contrast that with Meta, whose net profit margins analysts estimate will fall 16 percentage points to 19%, according to Refinitiv. An economic downturn will hurt technology giants but not equally.

321,META,2022-11-30,Cooley lays off 78 lawyers as U.S. law firms fight demand dip,"Law firms Cooley LLP Follow















(Reuters) - Silicon Valley-founded law firm Cooley said Wednesday it has laid off 150 U.S. employees, including 78 lawyers, amid a drop in client demand for the firm and the broader U.S. legal industry.

Joe Conroy, Cooley's chairman and CEO, said in a firmwide email reviewed by Reuters that certain practice groups were ""substantially overbuilt"" after aggressive hiring to meet soaring demand in 2020 and 2021.

""Simply put, we hired more talent than we can reasonably develop, train and deploy against current and anticipated client demand,"" Conroy said.

None of the attorneys who were laid off were partners, and a majority of the reductions came from the firm's business department, which handles M&A work, according to a person familiar with the layoffs.

Cooley earlier this month confirmed it had conducted an unspecified number of ""attorney separations"" as a result of annual mid-year associate performance reviews it held over the summer. A person familiar with the matter said those performance review-related departures were different from Wednesday's layoffs.

The layoffs come as many large tech companies — a core Cooley clientele — have also been trimming their workforces. Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc said earlier this month it would slash 11,000 jobs, and Amazon.com Inc said it had laid off some employees in what could preview much larger cuts.

Cooley had revenue of $1.98 billion last year and had more than 1,200 attorneys, according to trade publication American Lawyer.

Many U.S. law firms went on a hiring spree last year to keep up with record-breaking global M&A activity that topped $5.9 trillion in deals. But that transactional work has slowed in 2022, and the demand for legal services has dropped overall, Wells Fargo's Legal Specialty Group found earlier this month.

Conroy said the firm's recruiting success ""proved to be misaligned with the unexpected economic downturn that has occurred and will likely persist well into the year ahead.""

Conroy said the employees who have been laid off will receive severance benefits and other services.

322,META,2022-08-15,Facebook's former top lawyer jumps to international law firm Latham & Watkins,"













(Reuters) - Latham & Watkins said in a statement Monday it has recruited Colin Stretch, who served as the top lawyer at Facebook Inc for about six years before leaving the tech giant in 2019.

Stretch will be of counsel at the international law firm's Washington, D.C., office, where he will work with both startups and public company clients, according to Latham.

As general counsel role at Facebook, now known as Meta Platforms Inc, he testified before Congress in high-profile hearings in 2017 as the U.S. investigated Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Facebook said as many as 126 million Americans over two years may have seen politically divisive posts that originated in Russia under fake names. A 2019 report from then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller found that the Russian government interfered in the election in a ""sweeping and systemic fashion,"" which Russia has denied.

Stretch told a panel of federal lawmakers in October 2017 testimony that Facebook in retrospect ""should have had a broader lens"" to spot political ads bought with Russian money. Stretch declined to comment on the testimony on Monday.

Ian Schuman, the global chair of Latham's capital markets and public companies practices, said that ""the judgment, the ability to see around corners, the war stories Colin has gotten at Facebook makes us more valuable to clients.""

Stretch attributed his decision to leave Facebook in 2019 to a commute from his family's home in D.C. to his job in Silicon Valley that ""just became too much.""

After leaving Facebook, Stretch began lecturing at New York-based Columbia University's law and business schools. Latham said Stretch will continue teaching at both.

Stretch joined Facebook in 2010 after a 10-year stint at D.C. law firm Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick. He was present for the company's 2012 initial public offering, as well as its acquisitions of photo-sharing social network Instagram in that same year and messaging service WhatsApp in 2014.

Stretch left the company prior to the U.S. suing Facebook in December 2020, alleging that it acted illegally to maintain a social network monopoly. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has asked a judge to order Facebook to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.

Facebook has argued that the FTC has failed to ""plausibly establish"" that it acted illegally to protect a monopoly.

Meta has tapped Latham in several lawsuits, including an ongoing trade secrets case pending in Boston federal court. Meta is accused of misappropriating computer algorithms developed by start-up Neural Magic Inc. The company has denied the allegations.

323,META,2022-08-02,"Antitrust watchdogs go big on drama, light on plot","













NEW YORK, Aug 2 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Competition watchdogs are throwing the book at some some odd targets. The Department of Justice went to court read more on Monday with book publisher Penguin Random House over its $2.2 billion acquisition of smaller rival Simon & Schuster, a case whose witnesses include horror author Stephen King. Separately, the Federal Trade Commission is wrestling with Facebook owner Meta Platforms over its purchase of Within Unlimited, the maker of a virtual-reality fitness app. Both cases test new and important ideas. Meanwhile trustbusters risk missing out on the bigger picture.

Penguin Random House, owned by the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann (BTGGg.F), is the biggest book publisher in the United States so it’s not unusual that its merger with a rival would attract regulatory attention. What’s odd is that chief U.S. antitrust litigator Jonathan Kanter and his team are chiefly concerned that the deal would reduce writers’ payments read more , rather than that it will raise the price of books. And FTC head Lina Khan has complained that Meta’s purchase of Within, for an undisclosed price, is an attempt to “buy its way to the top” – even though the FTC didn’t gatecrash Mark Zuckerberg’s firm’s earlier acquisition of customer-service software maker Kustomer for $1 billion.

True, it makes sense for antitrust guardians to spend more time sweating the small stuff. Facebook was allowed to buy Instagram in 2012, a deal that presented no threat of consumers being saddled with rising prices since both companies’ products are free. Yet that merger helped what’s now Meta balloon to its present $430 billion in market value, with a dominant position in online advertising. The Department of Justice argues that Penguin Random House’s deal will lessen quality, choice and innovation, reflecting the reality that consumers can be harmed without being directly hit in the pocketbook.

Yet there are bigger deals to scrutinize, for more conventional reasons. Amazon.com (AMZN.O) closed its $8.5 billion purchase of movie studio MGM even though Khan has been a vocal critic read more of Jeff Bezos’ e-commerce empire and what she argues is its effect on competition. Microsoft (MSFT.O) too is pursuing its biggest acquisition to date, shelling out $69 billion for “Call of Duty” video-game maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) even though the software giant is home to one of the world’s most prominent gaming consoles, the Xbox. Since regulators have only finite resources, the search for a new plot creates the risk that the real story gets missed.

Nov 10 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever.

All eyes are turning to the latest U.S. inflation figures, but all tongues are wagging about the crash in crypto.

The October snapshot of U.S. consumer prices comes at a slightly more nervous juncture for markets than even a few days ago. Not only has the FTX collapse triggered turmoil across the crypto universe, Meta Inc. (META.O) laying off 13% of its workforce has brought the tech and economic outlook back into sharp focus.

U.S. rates market have been comfortable pricing an implied terminal rate above 5%, to be reached some time in the middle of next year, for over a week. Sticky inflation could push these expectations even higher, but how much more will the Fed really tighten without slamming the economy?

Economists expect monthly and annual core readings to dip from September, and the headline annual rate to fall to 8.0% from 8.2%. That would be the lowest since February.

As terminal rate forecasts have plateaued since the turn of the month, Treasury yields have been pretty rangebound and the dollar has eased back from its recent 20-year peak. Perhaps macro traders are laying the ground for a move.

Meanwhile, there have been moves aplenty in other markets. Bitcoin sank 10% on Tuesday and 12% on Wednesday to a two-year low below $16,500. Thursday marks a year to the day since its all-time peak of $69,000. Not a particularly happy anniversary.

chart

Could cratering crypto be spilling over to tech? The web of holdings and investments between crypto and tech is murky, but real.

Tesla shares sank to a two-year low on Wednesday, and Cathie Wood's ARKK Innovation ETF slumped to a five-year low - it is down 80% from its peak last year. Meta shares may have surged as investors cheered the 11,000 job cuts, but dismissals on that scale are a clear health warning for sector.

Markets may be getting twitchy. For the first time in a month, the VIX 'fear index' rose two days in a row.

NEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Two Sigma Investments, Hudson Bay Capital Management, and Soros Fund Management were among the prominent hedge funds that added stakes in mega-cap technology companies in the last quarter, positioning themselves to potentially benefit from the recent comeback in growth stocks.

Two Sigma Investments, for instance, added a new position in Facebook-parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) of slightly more than 1.5 million shares that was worth $248.5 million at the end of June, according to securities filings.

Hudson Bay Capital added a new position of 4.66 million shares in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) worth nearly $638 million at the end of June, while Soros Fund Management added a new position of nearly 30,000 shares in Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) worth $20.1 million at the time of the filing.

Meta Platform's shares are up 12.1% so far this quarter, Apple has gained 26.6% and Tesla's shares have increased 37.8%.

Quarterly filings known as 13-fs are one of the few ways that hedge funds are required to disclose their long positions, but may not reflect current holdings.

Tech and growth stocks have come screaming back in recent weeks after a brutal first half of the year, as some investors bet the Federal Reserve will be less hawkish than previously anticipated in its fight to tame the worst inflation in forty years.

The Russell 1000 Growth Index (.RLG), which is dominated by tech stocks, is up 17.6% for the current quarter, compared with the 10.5% gain in the Russell 1000 Value index (.RLV).

The tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 19%.

Besides mega-cap tech companies, funds also added new positions in smaller growth and tech companies.

Soros, for instance, added 300,000 shares in Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N) that were worth $6.1 million at the end of the quarter, while Two Sigma bought 10.6 million shares of Snap Inc (SNAP.N) worth approximately $140 million at the end of June.

Shares of Snap are down 6.7% for the quarter to date, while shares of Uber are up nearly 59% over the same time.

July 27 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) results sparked a relief rally on Wednesday in heavyweight technology and growth shares as investors expressed confidence in Big Tech's ability to navigate a recession.

High-growth and megacap companies have powered the U.S. stock market for the past decade, but rising interest rates to combat decades-high inflation as well as a recent sharp rally in the dollar have taken a toll on the stocks.

The rate-sensitive growth stocks (.RLG) fell 25% this year as the Federal Reserve began its monetary policy tightening, compared with a near 18% fall in the S&P 500 index.

An eagerly-anticipated interest rate decision by the Fed later on Wednesday will be pivotal for the rate-sensitive group. The central bank is expected to raise rates by 75 basis points.

Alphabet shares rose 4.5% after the company reported better-than-expected Google ad sales, while Microsoft rose 3.1% after it said it targets double-digit growth in fiscal revenue. read more

""The guidance was pretty good and that helped the market know that the landscape is definitely slowing but at the end of the day, good companies are going to navigate it well,"" said Burt White, chief strategy officer at Carson Group.

""The market has rebounded and is now looking for leadership from some of the big tech names.""

Focus will now be on ad revenue at Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O) after disappointing results from Snapchat's owner Snap Inc (SNAP.N) last week sparked a selloff in social media and ad tech firms. read more

Meta shares rose 2.7%, while Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), which are slated to post reports on Thursday, firmed 2.5% and 0.5%, respectively.

Oct 28 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) independent oversight board said on Friday it would ""welcome the opportunity"" to discuss Twitter's plans on content moderation in more detail with the company.

""Independent oversight of content moderation has a vital role to play in building trust in platforms and ensuring users are treated fairly,"" the oversight board said in a tweet.

Elon Musk, who recently acquired Twitter, said on Friday the company will be forming a content moderation council with ""widely diverse viewpoints"".

Summary Companies Digital ad group says it maintained momentum in Q3

Reiterates full-year earnings forecast

Shares rise as much as 9%















LONDON, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Martin Sorrell said his digital ad group S4 Capital (SFOR.L) had maintained momentum in a third quarter marked by disappointing results from major platforms including Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O) and Facebook's Meta (META.O). read more read more

""The prospects for Alphabet, Meta, Amazon in particular, and for TikTok are not as good as they were - there has been a slowing of growth - but it continues to be pretty strong,"" he told Reuters on Monday.

""And then the other side of it, in technology services and digital transformation, most of the prognostications of that are around growth of 20 to 25% over the next four or five years, so we think we're well positioned to take advantage of both those things.""

S4, launched by Sorrell in 2018 after he left the world's biggest ad holding group WPP, said like-for-like gross profit/net revenue rose more than 29% in the three months to end-September, keeping it on track for growth of 25% for the year.

It said it would produce operational core earnings of about 120 million pounds ($142 million) this year, in line with guidance cut in July, reflecting the costs of a hiring spree.

Shares in S4 rose 9% to 229 pence in early deals, the highest level since the downgrade in the summer.

Sorrell said Twitter and Snap, which each account for around 1% of the digital ad market, were not a good indicator for the sector.

He said advertisers were pausing spending on Twitter pending clarity on how new owner Elon Musk would moderate content.

Musk had three main problems, Sorrell said, namely ad revenue and content moderation, the loss of some good people in the recent layoffs and the opportunity costs for his other ventures like Tesla (TSLA.O) and SpaceX.

""But it doesn't pay to bet against him,"" he said. ""So I think he'll get it right in the end, but it's going to be very bumpy.

""At the moment most clients are suspending their activities because they're worried about extreme content and content moderation on the site.""

333,META,2023-01-23,Spotify to trim 6% of workforce in latest tech layoffs,"













Jan 23 (Reuters) - Spotify Technology SA (SPOT.N) said on Monday it plans to cut 6% of its workforce and would take a related charge of up to nearly $50 million, adding to the massive layoffs in the technology sector in preparation for a possible recession.

The tech industry is facing a demand downturn after two years of pandemic-powered growth during which it had hired aggressively. That has led firms from Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) to Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to shed thousands of jobs.

""Over the last few months we've made a considerable effort to rein in costs, but it simply hasn't been enough,"" Chief Executive Daniel Elk said in a blog post announcing the roughly 600 job cuts.

""I was too ambitious in investing ahead of our revenue growth,"" he added, echoing a sentiment voiced by other tech bosses in recent months.

Spotify's operating expenditure grew at twice the speed of its revenue last year as the audio-streaming company aggressively poured money into its podcast business, which is more attractive for advertisers due to higher engagement levels.

At the same time, businesses pulled back on ad spending on the platform, mirroring a trend seen at Meta and Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), as rapid interest rate hikes and the fallout from the Russia-Ukraine war pressured the economy.

The company, whose shares rose 5.8% to $103.55, is now restructuring itself in a bid to cut costs and adjust to the deteriorating economic picture.

It said Dawn Ostroff, the head of content and advertising, was leaving after an over four-year stint at the company. Ostroff helped shape Spotify's podcast business and guided it through backlash around Joe Rogan's show for allegedly spreading misinformation about COVID-19.

The company said it is appointing Alex Norström, head of the freemium business, and research and development boss Gustav Söderström as co-presidents.

Spotify had about 9,800 full-time employees as of Sept. 30.

334,META,2022-07-25,Tech giants to self-regulate in reducing harmful content in New Zealand,"













WELLINGTON, July 25 (Reuters) - Big tech companies agreed on Monday to reduce harmful online content in New Zealand, making a move that critics said dodged the alternative of government regulation.

Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Alphabet-owned Google (GOOGL.O), TikTok, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N) had signed a code of practice, said Netsafe, a government-funded internet-safety group.

The companies would follow the code as self-regulation, Netsafe chief Brent Carey said in a statement.

""There are too many Kiwis being bullied, harassed, and abused online, which is why the industry has rallied together to protect users,"" Carey said in a statement.

Industry lobby group NZTech will be responsible for the companies meeting obligations, which include reducing harmful content online, reporting how they do that and supporting independent evaluation of results.

""We hope the governance framework will enable it to evolve alongside local conditions, while at the same time respecting the fundamental rights of freedom of expression,"" said NZTech chief executive Graeme Muller.

Meta and TikTok said in statements they were enthusiastic about the code making online platforms safer and more transparent.

Interest groups want more detail, however - for example, about sanctions for any failure by the companies to comply and about a mechanism for public complaints.

They also point to the pact being administered by an industry body, not the government.

""This is a weak attempt to preempt regulation – in New Zealand and overseas – by promoting an industry-led model,"" Mandy Henk, chief executive of Tohatoha NZ, a non-profit organisation that lobbies on the social impact of technology, said in a statement.

The framework that the companies agreed to is called the Aotearoa New Zealand Code of Practice for Online Safety and Harms.

New Zealand has been a leader in trying to stamp out violent extremism online. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and French President Emmanuel Macron in 2019 launched a global initiative to end online hate.

NAIROBI, July 29 (Reuters) - Kenya's ethnic cohesion watchdog has given Meta's (META.O) Facebook seven days to tackle hate speech and incitement on the platform relating to next month's election, failing which its operations will be suspended.

East Africa's biggest economy is in the throes of campaigning ahead of presidential, legislative and local authorities elections on Aug. 9.

Advocacy group Global Witness said in a report published on Thursday that Facebook had accepted and carried more than a dozen political advertisements that breached Kenya's rules.

Kenya's National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) said the report corroborates its own internal findings.

""Facebook is in violation of the laws of our country. They have allowed themselves to be a vector of hate speech and incitement, misinformation and disinformation,"" Danvas Makori, an NCIC commissioner said on Friday.

Meta has taken ""extensive steps"" to weed out hate speech and inflammatory content, and it is intensifying those efforts ahead of the election, a company spokesperson told Reuters.

""We have dedicated teams of Swahili speakers and proactive detection technology to help us remove harmful content quickly and at scale,"" the spokesperson said.

The NCIC has held talks with the Communications Authority of Kenya (CAK), which regulates social media firms, and it will recommend the suspension of Meta's operations, Makori said.

He accused Meta of violating Kenya's constitution and laws governing hate speech and the use of social media platforms.

""This country is bigger than a social media company or an entity. We will not allow Facebook, or any other social media company, to jeopardise security,"" he said.

Supporters of the leading presidential candidates, veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga and deputy president William Ruto, have used social media platforms to praise their candidates, persuade others to join them or to accuse opposing sides of various misdeeds.

The NCIC is a statutory body established to foster ethnic harmony among Kenya's 45 tribes, some of which have targeted each other during violence in past polls.

REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino















LONDON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Facebook approved a series of online ads promoting violence in Brazil, days after protesters ransacked government buildings, according to a new report.

Earlier this month, thousands of supporters of Brazil’s far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro stormed the nation’s congress, supreme court, and presidential palace in an attack lasting more than three hours.

In an attempt to stem the flow of posts inciting violence online, Facebook’s parent company Meta (META.O) said it had designated Brazil as a “temporary high-risk location” and removed content calling for people to take up arms or forcibly invade government buildings.

However, four days after the uprising, human rights organisation Global Witness found Facebook was still allowing ads containing death threats and other calls to violence on its platform.

Using fake accounts, the group submitted 16 bogus ads to run on the platform, 14 of which were approved for publication.

Among the approved ads were messages which read, in Portuguese: “We need to unearth all the rats that have seized power and shoot them”, “We need a military revolution to restore the rule of law”, and “Death to the children of Lula voters”.

Leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took office on Jan. 1 after defeating Bolsonaro in a runoff election in October. Bolsonaro refused to concede defeat, however, and some supporters claimed the election was stolen.

Global Witness also submitted the ads for approval on YouTube, but the video-sharing platform immediately suspended the group's accounts.

Global Witness said it withdrew the ads from Facebook before any other users could see them.

“In the aftermath of the violence in Brasilia, Facebook said they were ‘actively monitoring’ the situation and removing content in violation of their policies. This test shows how poorly they’re able to enforce what they say,” said Rosie Sharpe, digital threats campaigner at Global Witness.

“YouTube’s much stronger response demonstrates that the test we have set is possible to pass.”

Meta spokesperson Mitch Henderson said Global Witness’ small sample of ads was not representative of how the company enforced its policies at scale.

“Like we’ve said in the past, ahead of last year’s election in Brazil, we removed hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that violated our policies on violence and incitement and rejected tens of thousands of ad submissions before they ran.

“We use technology and teams to help keep our platforms safe from abuse and we’re constantly refining our processes to enforce our policies at scale.”

337,META,2022-11-09,"Mexico's 'out of control' illegal trafficking threatens wildlife, report says","













MEXICO CITY, Nov 9 (Reuters) - A U.S. environmental group said on Wednesday it had filed a complaint to Mexican state prosecutors, arguing that toothless regulation was allowing illegal wildlife trafficking to threaten species in one of the world's most biodiverse countries.

""Wildlife trafficking in Mexico is out of control,"" the Arizona-based Center for Biological Diversity said in a report pointing to lax penalties, lack of political will and unregulated markets, despite laws prohibiting the trade of protected species.

Although they are protected by law, animals such as toucans, monkeys, bears and jaguars are openly and increasingly sold on platforms including Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) Facebook and Instagram and Chinese firm ByteDance's TikTok, the report found.

A Meta spokesperson told Reuters that company policies prohibited the sale of endangered animals and it removed infringing content or accounts as it detected them, in collaboration with national organizations and user reports.

Neither Mexico's environmental ministry nor Byte Dance immediately responded to requests for comment.

Researchers who scoured social networks, visited local markets and interviewed experts and officials said propagation of false online profiles made the trade harder for authorities to regulate.

Mexico is one of the world's few ""megadiverse"" countries, housing some 10% to 12% of the world's known species. But according to the study, illegal trafficking is having an irreversible impact on the country's ecosystems.

The populations of native species such as the totoaba, vaquita marina, howler monkey, scarlet macaw and the sea cucumber have plunged in recent years due to demand from China alongside the involvement of organized crime in the business, worth an estimated $100 billion annually.

Howler monkeys are sold as exotic pets, while vaquitas, the world's smallest porpoises, are among the planet's most endangered mammals as they are often trapped in nets of fishers looking for totoabas, whose swim bladders are used in traditional Chinese medicine.

The report said a Mexican special prosecutor's office had tackled internet wildlife trafficking until the start of 2019, but the office was shut to save money under the administration of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.

""Budget cuts to the environmental agency responsible for verifying, monitoring and inspecting the sale of wildlife in Mexico have allowed the problem to continue to grow,"" it said.

TIRANA, June 4 (Reuters) - Albania's parliament on Saturday voted in chief of defence Bajram Begaj as the country's new president, a largely ceremonial position.

With 78 votes in favour in the 140-seat parliament, Begaj will run Albania’s highest office for the next five years.

Major General Bajram Begaj, 55, became chief of defence of Albania's armed forces in 2020 after holding different positions within the army, mainly in the field of medicine.Begaj will take office in July from outgoing president Ilir Meta. He was elected in the fourth round of voting after three previous rounds failed to reach a consensus.

During the first three rounds, a majority of three-fifths of the votes was needed to vote in the new president.Begaj was elected with a simple majority with the votes of the ruling Socialist Party of Prime Minister Edi Rama.

The role of president is largely symbolic, though it has some powers over the judiciary and the military.

339,META,2023-02-14,U.S. FTC commissioner Christine Wilson to resign,"













Feb 14 (Reuters) - Christine Wilson, the sole Republican on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), said on Tuesday she will resign soon, blaming the move on the agency's top official, Lina Khan.

""Much ink has been spilled about Lina Khan's attempts to remake federal antitrust law as chairman of the Federal Trade Commission,"" Wilson wrote in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal. ""Less has been said about her disregard for the rule of law and due process and the way senior FTC officials enable her.""

Wilson said in the piece that she would resign ""soon"" but gave no date.

Her departure will not change the balance of power in the commission. It should have five members but without Wilson, a Republican, it would have just Khan, as chair, and commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. All three are Democrats.

Khan, Slaughter and Bedoya said in a brief statement that they wished Wilson well. ""While we often disagreed with Commissioner Wilson, we respect her devotion to her beliefs and are grateful for her public service,"" they said.

The agency declined further comment.

Wilson said Khan has been responsible for ""abuses of power,"" such as voting to challenge Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) acquisition of virtual reality content maker Within. Wilson argued that Khan had said before coming to the FTC that Meta should not be able to make additional acquisitions, and that this meant Khan should be recused from FTC deliberations regarding the deal.

""I dissented on due-process grounds, which require those sitting in a judicial capacity to avoid even the appearance of unfairness,"" wrote Wilson. The FTC lost the fight to stop the deal.

Wilson accused the Biden administration FTC of overstepping by being too aggressive in stopping mergers and banning most noncompete clauses.

The telecoms operators sought approval from the EU antitrust watchdog on Jan. 6 for the joint venture, which would be their first attempt to take on Meta (META.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google in the lucrative online advertising sector.

The Commission can approve the deal with or without remedies or it can open a four-month long investigation if it has serious concerns.

""The JV will offer a privacy-led, digital identification solution to support the digital marketing and advertising activities of brands and publishers,"" the Commission said.

341,META,2023-01-05,Big tech layoffs may further disrupt equity and diversity efforts,"













NEW YORK, Jan 5 (Reuters) - 2023 is shaping up as a challenging year to be a woman or minority working in the tech sector, or even a person with one too many years under their belt.

Surging firings by technology companies last year are disproportionately affecting women and mid-career talent which may make it more difficult to improve diversity in one of the most sought-after industries, according to data from a research firm.

In recent years, U.S. tech majors have stepped up hiring and made diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) a priority. But as the industry grapples with over-hiring since mid-2020, rising interest rates and changes in business and consumer behavior, tech companies have announced deep cuts, risking their diversity efforts.

Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) layoffs will now include more than 18,000 roles as part of a workforce reduction it previously disclosed, its CEO said on Wednesday. That comes to about 6% of its corporate workforce. Salesforce Inc (CRM.N) said on Wednesday it planned to eliminate about 10% of its staff.

The rare shakeup in big tech companies risks further disrupting diversity pledges that have already grown stagnant as companies de-emphasize DEI efforts.

Companies including Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Amazon.com, Twitter Inc and Snap Inc (SNAP.N) have together cut over 97,000 jobs in 2022 to deal with the slowing economy and shareholder pressures, according to a report from employment firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. That is up 649% from 2021.

Women and Latino workers represent 46.64% and 11.49%, respectively, of the tech layoffs from September to December 2022, while those segments make up 39.09% and 9.96%, respectively, of the entire industry, according to data from Revelio Labs Inc, a startup that analyzed data from tech layoff tracker Layoffs.fyi and talent database Parachute List by Rocket.

Reuters Graphics

Mid-career talent is also overrepresented in layoffs, said Reyhan Ayas, Revelio Labs senior economist.

Meta, for instance, committed in 2019 to doubling the number of Black and Hispanic employees in its U.S. workforce as well as doubling the number of women in its global workforce by 2024.

Donald Tomaskovic-Devey, sociology professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who studied U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity data for 2008-2016, found that about 7% of tech firms are actively trying to diversify their workforce.

Tomaskovic-Devey said if the same pattern holds, the current round of layoffs will lead to fewer women and non-Asian minorities in tech firms and further entrench the dominance of white and Asian males in the industry.

Twitter was hit with a lawsuit that claimed the social media company disproportionately targeted female employees in layoffs.

Snap and Twitter did not respond to requests for comment. Meta declined to comment.

DISRUPT DIVERSITY

Black and Asian talent has been less affected by the job cuts but the unexpected layoffs in tech may make it more difficult to attract diverse early-career talent to ""the cool kid on the block"" or well-known tech companies, said Morgan DeBaun, CEO of Blavity Inc, which hosts the largest annual Black tech conference, AfroTech.

This will disrupt diversity efforts even further, said Benjamin Juarez, a recruiting consultant and co-founder of Latinos in Tech. Underrepresented talent will face increased competition for entry-level roles as experienced workers settle for those jobs, he added.

Entry-level jobs often present the best option for diverse candidates to get a foothold in the tech industry.

""Someone looking to break in to tech for the first time should anticipate that it could be a long road,"" said Amanda Daering, co-founder of HR consulting firm Newance which builds finance and tech teams at startups.

Companies have made cuts to budgets allocated to make workplaces more diverse, said Nadiyah Johnson, CEO of Milky Way Tech Hub, which helps corporations source diverse candidates.

""There's been patterns of pushing back projects that at one point in time were a priority, especially the first year or two since the George Floyd murder,"" she said.

Still, some are hopeful.

Latinos in Tech's Juarez said he is hopeful that massive layoffs will give rise to minority led-startups, his preferred solution to the stagnant DEI efforts.

""We want to increase the amount of Latinos in the tech space but we're starting to see that some of these DEI efforts just don't work and we just need to essentially build our own path.""

Summary Law firms

Law firms Related documents Antitrust plaintiffs in separate case question ""broad"" language

Hearing set for Oct. 27















(Reuters) - A group of plaintiffs' lawyers has raised questions about the scope of Meta Platform Inc's pending $90 million privacy settlement in California federal court, telling a judge that their allegations in a separate antitrust case should be carved out and not swept up into the deal.

The attorneys at Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro and Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan said in a court filing on Monday they were concerned that broad language in the privacy settlement could be used to thwart pending antitrust claims in front of another judge in California's Northern U.S. District Court.

Attorneys for Facebook in the two cases did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. A representative from Facebook also did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Facebook has denied liability in both cases.

The privacy settlement would resolve claims that Facebook tracked users' web activity even after they had logged out of the social media website. In the antitrust case, Facebook is accused of exploiting user data to curb competition. The case also involves the company's data collection practices.

The data privacy settlement announced in February ""risks providing a benefit to common defendant Meta Platforms Inc for which it did not bargain and to which it is not entitled,"" lawyers for the antitrust plaintiffs said in Monday's court filing.

The plaintiffs' attorneys asked U.S. District Judge Edward Davila to include a sentence in the privacy settlement that says the resolution of the dispute does not limit the claims alleged in the antitrust litigation.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the antitrust case and for the data privacy plaintiffs on Tuesday did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

A hearing on the data privacy settlement is scheduled for Oct. 27.

The antitrust plaintiffs' lawyers said they are concerned about language in the privacy settlement that releases ""any and all claims ... whether known or unknown."" The attorneys argued in their filing that the alleged injuries in the two cases are ""fundamentally different.""

The data privacy plaintiffs sought to recover damages for invasion of privacy. The antitrust plaintiffs said they are seeking damages ""based on the diminished compensation that they received for their data because of Facebook's destruction of competition.""

The case is In re Facebook Internet Tracking Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 5:12-md-02314.

Users had earlier complained of not being able to send and receive text messages on iMessage and some reported problems with placing FaceTime calls.

More than 2,000 users reported issues with sending messages on the app, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.

Downdetector tracks outages by collating status reports from several sources including user-submitted errors on its platform. The outage may be affecting a larger number of users.

Sept 22 (Reuters) - Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen is launching a nonprofit organization that will seek solutions to harms created by social media, she said on Thursday.

The former product manager at Facebook, since renamed Meta Platforms (META.O), made headlines last year after coming out as the source of thousands of leaked internal documents, which she said detailed the social media company's failures to protect teen girls on Instagram and clamp down on vaccine misinformation.

Facebook has consistently said it disagrees with Haugen's characterization.

Her nonprofit, Beyond the Screen, will create an open database to document ways that Big Tech companies are failing their ""ethical obligations to society"" and outline possible solutions, according to a press release.

It will partner with Project Liberty, an organization working to build a new operating protocol for social networking, and Common Sense Media, which advocates for safe media content for kids.

NEW DELHI, April 6 (Reuters) - India's VerSe Innovation has raised $805 million in a funding round led by Canada's top pension fund, putting a $5 billion valuation on the Google-backed (GOOGL.O) parent of short-video app Josh and news aggregator Dailyhunt.

The funding round saw participation from firms including Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board, Luxor Capital and Sumeru Ventures.

VerSe said the investment will strengthen the AI-powered local language content platform across its family of apps, which targets the next billion of internet users from India.

Josh, which has more than 150 million monthly active users, competes in India with home-grown rival Moj and Meta Platforms Inc's (FB.O) Instagram Reels, all of which have sprung up since the country blocked the popular TikTok in June 2020 amid a border crisis with China.

The short video space has since attracted global investor interest in applications filling the gap.

347,META,2022-07-18,Indonesia urges tech platforms to sign up to new licensing rules or risk being blocked,"













JAKARTA, July 18 (Reuters) - Indonesia urged tech companies on Monday to register under new licensing rules, or run the risk of having their platforms blocked, with data showing many big tech firms such as Google and Meta had yet to comply days out from July 20 deadline.

The requirement to register is part of a set of rules, first released in November 2020, that will allow authorities to order platforms to take down content deemed unlawful, or that ""disturbs public order"" within four hours if considered urgent, and 24 hours if not.

In a text message to Reuters, Communications Minister Johnny G. Plate urged companies to register before sanctions were applied. His ministry said last month that platforms could be blocked if they did not comply.

As of Monday, more than 5,900 domestic companies and 108 foreign companies had registered, including short-video app TikTok and music streaming firm Spotify (SPOT.N), according to communications ministry data.

Other platforms such as Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O), Twitter (TWTR.N) and Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, have not yet registered.

Spokespeople for Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Google, did not respond to requests for comment.

The new licensing system applies to all domestic and foreign Electronic Service Operators.

The government can also compel companies to reveal communications and personal data of specific users if requested by law enforcement or government agencies.

The government says the new rules have been formulated to ensure internet service providers protect consumer data, and that online content is used in a ""positive and productive"" way.

Despite the threat, some analysts doubt whether Indonesian authorities would immediately block platforms operated by non-compliant companies, especially given how widely used some of the platforms are in Indonesia, including by state officials.

With a youthful, digitally savvy population of 270 million, Indonesia is a top-10 market globally by number of users for a host of social media companies, including TikTok, Twitter and Facebook.

Some activists say the new articles related to content posed a threat to privacy and freedom of expression.

""Our analysis shows that this will be the most repressive regulation of its kind in the region,"" said Nenden Arum, from digital rights group, the Southeast Asia Freedom of Expression Network (SAFEnet).

Minister Plate said the registration requirement was administrative and not about content.

There were an estimated 191 million social media users in Indonesia as of February 2022, according to Statista. Only China and India have more social media users in the Asia Pacific region.

SINGAPORE, Jan 15 (Reuters) - (This Jan. 15 story has been corrected to remove the reference that Sumitomo Corp and KDDI have stakes in MPT in paragraph 8)

Israel's Cognyte Software Ltd (CGNT.O) won a tender to sell intercept spyware to a Myanmar state-backed telecommunications firm a month before the Asian nation's February 2021 military coup, according to documents reviewed by Reuters.

The deal was made even though Israel has claimed it stopped defence technology transfers to Myanmar following a 2017 ruling by Israel's Supreme Court, according to a legal complaint recently filed with Israel's attorney general and disclosed on Sunday.

While the ruling was subjected to a rare gag order at the request of the state and media cannot cite the verdict, Israel's government has publicly stated on numerous occasions that defence exports to Myanmar are banned.

The complaint, led by high-profile Israeli human rights lawyer Eitay Mack who spearheaded the campaign for the Supreme Court ruling, calls for a criminal investigation into the deal. It accuses Cognyte and unnamed defence and foreign ministry officials who supervise such deals of ""aiding and abetting crimes against humanity in Myanmar.""

The complaint was filed on behalf of more than 60 Israelis, including a former speaker of the house as well as prominent activists, academics and writers.

The documents about the deal, provided to Reuters and Mack by activist group Justice for Myanmar, are a January 2021 letter with attachments from Myanmar Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) to local regulators that list Cognyte as the winning vendor for intercept technology and note the purchase order was issued ""by 30th Dec 2020"".

Intercept spyware can give authorities the power to listen in on calls, view text messages and web traffic including emails, and track the locations of users without the assistance of telecom and internet firms.

Representatives for Cognyte, Myanmar’s military government and MPT did not respond to multiple Reuters requests for comment. Japan's Sumitomo Corp (8053.T) and KDDI Corp (9433.T) which have a telecoms joint venture in Myanmar that provides technical and marketing support to MPT's operations, declined to comment on communication intercept matters, saying they were not privy to such details.

Israel's attorney general did not respond to requests for comment about the complaint. The foreign affairs ministry did not respond to requests for comment about the deal, while the defence ministry declined to comment.

Two people with knowledge of Myanmar’s intercept plans separately told Reuters the Cognyte system was tested by MPT. They declined to be identified for fear of retribution by Myanmar's junta.

MPT uses intercept spyware, a source with direct knowledge of the matter and three people briefed on the issue told Reuters although they did not identify the vendor. Reuters was unable to determine whether the sale of Cognyte intercept technology to MPT was finalised.

Even before the coup, public concern had mounted in Israel about the country's defence exports to Myanmar after a brutal 2017 crackdown by the military on the country's Rohingya population while Aung San Suu Kyi's government was in power. The crackdown prompted the petition led by Mack that asked the Supreme Court to ban arms exports to Myanmar.

Since the coup, the junta has killed thousands of people including many political opponents, according to the United Nations.

COGNYTE UNDER FIRE

Many governments around the world allow for what are commonly called ‘lawful intercepts’ to be used by law enforcement agencies to catch criminals but the technology is not ordinarily employed without any kind of legal process, cybersecurity experts have said.

According to industry executives and activists previously interviewed by Reuters, Myanmar's junta is using invasive telecoms spyware without legal safeguards to protect human rights.

Mack said Cognyte's participation in the tender contradicts statements made by Israeli officials after the Supreme court ruling that no security exports had been made to Myanmar.

While intercept spyware is typically described as ""dual-use"" technology for civilian and defence purposes, Israeli law states that ""dual-use"" technology is classified as defence equipment.

Israeli law also requires companies exporting defence-related products to seek licenses for export and marketing when doing deals. The legal complaint said any officials who granted Cognyte licenses for Myanmar deals should be investigated. Reuters was unable to determine whether Cognyte obtained such licenses.

Around the time of the 2020 deal, the political situation in Myanmar was tense with the military disputing the results of an election won by Suu Kyi.

Norway's Telenor (TEL.OL), previously one of the biggest telecoms firms in Myanmar before withdrawing from the country last year, also said in a Dec. 3, 2020 briefing and statement that it was concerned about Myanmar authorities’ plans for a lawful intercept due to insufficient legal safeguards.

Nasdaq-listed Cognyte was spun off in February 2021 from Verint Systems Inc (VRNT.O), a pioneering giant in Israel's cybersecurity industry.

Cognyte, which had $474 million in annual revenue for its last financial year, was also banned from Facebook in 2021. Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) said in a report Cognyte ""enables managing fake accounts across social media platforms"".

Meta said its investigation identified Cognyte customers in a range of countries such as Kenya, Mexico and Indonesia and their targets included journalists and politicians. It did not identify the customers or the targets.

Meta did not respond to a request for further comment.

Norway’s sovereign wealth fund last month dropped Cognyte from its portfolio, saying states said to be customers of its surveillance products and services ""have been accused of extremely serious human rights violations"". The fund did not name any states.

Cognyte has not responded publicly to the claims made by Meta or Norway's sovereign wealth fund.

Summary

Summary Companies CFO says MercadoLibre is in test phase to process Brazil WhatsApp payments

The e-commerce firm to hold its cryptocurrency assets

MercadoLibre expects to grow advertising business ""multiple times""















LONDON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Latin American e-commerce retailer and fintech firm MercadoLibre (MELI.O) is in talks with Meta (META.O) to process payments for its WhatsApp messaging service starting in Brazil, the company's chief financial officer told Reuters on Wednesday.

Facebook owner Meta said last month that it will launch a payments tool in Latin America's largest economy, allowing WhatsApp users to message and buy from a business directly in the chat.

""We are in the test phase as one of the partners that processes payments in Brazil,"" Pedro Arnt told Reuters in an interview.

The payments tool in Brazil would allow WhatsApp users to find a company's account through a directory service and make in-app transactions with credit or debit cards.

""This could be an opportunity for us to leverage WhatsApp efficiently to generate more sales and better customer contacts,"" Arnt added.

He did not say how advanced the test phase is nor indicate the potential revenue generation for its financial arm Mercado Pago.

However, Brazil is one of WhatsApp's biggest markets, together with India and Indonesia.

Mercado Pago was among several companies named by WhatsApp last month as having the necessary technical integration, ""many of which"" were also participating in production testing.

MercadoLibre last month posted better-than-expected profit for the third quarter on record net revenue of $2.7 billion, with 88 million unique active users in 18 countries.

""We have a very strong relationship with our consumers because we can solve both their financial needs and their commerce needs. That puts us in a very strong position,"" Arnt said.

CRYPTO INVESTMENTS

The CFO said the firm will hold on to its cryptocurrency despite the market rout in the wake of the FTX exchange's collapse, allowing it to still offer Mercado Pago users in some countries the possibility to buy, hold and sell crypto within digital wallets.

The company's cryptocurrency investment of $30 million between the second and fourth quarter of 2021 is now worth $11 million, said Arnt.

""The market timing was wrong but it had a lot to do with learning about crypto storage, purchasing and selling,"" he said. ""No more purchases and we are not selling either, we are still holders of those assets.""

As the company expands its regional logistics network through Mercado Envios, Arnt said its fleet now contained more than 1,000 electric vehicles as it boosts same-day and next-day shipments.

The largest tech firm in Latin America by market capitalization is currently in talks with startups such as U.S. based Xos Trucks to work on design specifications of vehicles.

""We see this happening in 2024,"" he added.

MercadoLibre aims to continue investing in technology to provide retail advertisers with more insight into consumer behavior after the Ads business reached 1.3% penetration over gross merchandise volume. ""This business should be able to grow multiple times over the next few years,"" Arnt said.

350,META,2022-06-10,Messaging app Telegram to launch paid subscription plan,"













June 10 (Reuters) - Messaging app Telegram will launch a paid subscription plan for its users this month, founder Pavel Durov said on Friday.

Users who will opt for Telegram Premium will get a higher limit for chats, media and file uploads, Durov said in a blogpost.

""The only way to let our most demanding fans get more while keeping our existing features free is to make those raised limits a paid option,"" he said.

The app, along with messaging tool Signal, have seen an increase in users following privacy concerns with larger rival WhatsApp, owned by Meta Platforms Inc . Telegram currently has 500 million monthly active users and is one of the 10 most downloaded apps in the world, according to its website.

Durov said the move to offer a paid subscription was to ensure that Telegram remains funded primarily by its users and not advertisers.

BENGALURU, Nov 3 (Reuters) - WhatsApp is globally rolling out a feature called Communities to organize various chat groups in larger structures, as well as other features such as bigger group video calls and in-chat polls, the messaging service owned by Meta Platforms (META.O) said on Thursday.

The Communities feature will bring together various chat groups under bigger umbrellas where administrators could send alerts to a community of thousands – a feature that could be used by workplaces or schools.

The app will now also allow chat groups to have up to 1,024 users, much higher than the 256 participants restriction it had until recently, according to a company statement.

WhatsApp rivals, including Telegram and Discord, allow thousands of members in group chats.

Other feature releases include 32-person video calling as well as in-chat polls, a common fixture on social media apps, including Meta's Facebook and Twitter.

WhatsApp owner Meta already found guilty of 'extremist activity'

Dispute with foreign tech has escalated amid Ukraine conflict

This content was produced in Russia where the law restricts coverage of Russian military operations in Ukraine















MOSCOW, July 28 (Reuters) - A Russian court on Thursday fined Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) WhatsApp messenger, Snapchat owner Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and other foreign firms for their alleged refusal to store the data of Russian users domestically.

Moscow has clashed with Big Tech over content, censorship, data and local representation in disputes that have escalated since Russia sent its armed forces into Ukraine on Feb. 24. read more

Moscow's Tagansky District Court fined WhatsApp 18 million roubles ($301,255) for a repeat offence after it incurred a 4 million rouble penalty last August. WhatsApp's fine exceeded the 15 million rouble penalty handed to Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google for a repeat infringement last month.

The court fined Tinder owner Match Group (MTCH.O) 2 million roubles, Snap and Hotels.com, owned by Expedia Group Inc (EXPE.O), 1 million roubles, and music streaming service Spotify (SPOT.N) 500,000 roubles.

Communications regulator Roskomnadzor said the five companies had not provided documents confirming that the storage and processing of Russians users' data was taking place on Russian territory in time.

Expedia Group said in a statement it was reviewing the court's decision, but had no further information to provide.

""However, we can confirm that Hotels.com closed its Russian point of sale on April 1, 2022, and no longer collects Russian user data,"" Expedia said.

The other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Spotify closed its Russian office in March and soon afterwards suspended its service in the country. read more

Russia restricted access to Meta's flagship platforms Facebook and Instagram, as well as fellow social network Twitter (TWTR.N), soon after the conflict in Ukraine began, a move critics have cast as an effort by Russia to exert greater control over information flows.

Meta was found guilty of ""extremist activity"" in Russia and saw an appeal against the tag rejected in June, but Moscow has permitted WhatsApp to remain available. read more

More than 600 foreign companies have agreed to Russia's demands since the data storage law was passed in 2015, said Anton Gorelkin, deputy head of the Russian parliament's committee on information policy.

""In the context of the information war with the West, we are convinced that this law was necessary,"" Gorelkin wrote on Telegram. ""Only in this way can we be sure that foreign intelligence services and all kinds of fraudsters do not gain access to (the data).""

Jan 8 (Reuters) - Seattle's public school district filed a lawsuit against Big Tech claiming that the companies were responsible for a worsening mental health crisis among students and directly affected the schools' ability to carry out their educational mission.

The complaint, filed on Friday against Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and TikTok-owner ByteDance with the U.S. District Court, claimed they purposefully designed their products to hook young people to their platforms and were creating a mental health crisis.

In an emailed statement, Meta, which owns Facebook, said it has developed more than 30 tools to support teens and their families and will continue to work closely with experts, policymakers and parents.

Google said it has invested heavily in creating safe experiences for children across its platforms and has introduced ""strong protections and dedicated features to prioritize their well being,"" while Snap said it works closely with many mental health organizations to provide in-app tools and resources for users and that the well-being of its community is its top priority.

TikTok did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment. In the past, the companies have said they aim to create an enjoyable experience for users and exclude harmful content and invest in moderation and content controls.

The lawsuit says the companies' actions have been a substantial factor in causing a youth mental health crisis.

""Defendants have successfully exploited the vulnerable brains of youth, hooking tens of millions of students across the country into positive feedback loops of excessive use and abuse of Defendants' social media platforms,"" the lawsuit said.

Students with mental health issues perform worse, causing schools to take steps including training teachers to identify and address such symptoms, hire trained personnel, and create additional resources to warn students about the dangers of social media, the complaint said.

The lawsuit seeks compensation for monetary damages and other penalties.

In 2021, U.S. lawmakers accused Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg of pushing for higher profits at the expense of children's mental health following testimony by whistleblower Frances Haugen. Facebook has consistently said it disagrees with Haugen's characterization that the company failed to protect teen girls on Instagram.

""The argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical,"" Zuckerberg posted on his Facebook page in response. ""We make money from ads, and advertisers consistently tell us they don't want their ads next to harmful or angry content. And I don't know any tech company that sets out to build products that make people angry or depressed.""

354,META,2023-02-09,Twitter gets EU yellow card for disinformation reporting effort,"













BRUSSELS, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's Twitter was hit with a yellow card from the European Commission on Thursday as its reported efforts to tackle disinformation fell short of those by Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google, Meta Platforms (META.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and TikTok.

The companies presented progress reports on compliance with a beefed up European Union (EU) code of practice on disinformation in the last six months.

The reports included data on how much advertising revenue the companies had averted from disinformation actors, the number or value of political advertisements accepted or rejected and instances of manipulative behaviours detected.

The European Commission last year linked the code to new online content rules known as the Digital Services Act which allows regulators to fine companies as much as 6% of their global turnover for breaches.

Commission Vice-President for Values and Transparency Vera Jourova singled out Twitter for criticism.

Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

""I am disappointed to see that Twitter's report lags behind others and I expect a more serious commitment to their obligations stemming from the Code,"" Jourova said in a statement.

The EU executive said Twitter's report lacked data and did not contain information on commitments to empower fact checkers.

EU industry chief Thierry Breton warned of hefty sanctions for non-compliance.

""It is in the interest of all signatories to abide by their commitment to fully implement the code of practice against disinformation, in anticipation of the obligations under the Digital Services Act,"" he said.

Activist NGO Avaaz said Big Tech was falling short.

""The circus at Twitter is undermining the very foundations of the code. They've set the bar so low that nobody's looking at the failures of other platforms,"" its campaign director Luca Nicotra said.

""Google's made zero progress in collaborating with fact-checkers and is really behind on transparency and access to data. TikTok is trying to catch up but their algorithm is still massively accelerating disinformation. Despite some progress, Meta's sheer size means they're often still one of the biggest source of disinformation,"" he said.

Google said it was committed to making the code a success. Meta said it had invested heavily in its efforts and that its teams continue to work to improve its approach. TikTok said in a blogpost that it will ramp up its efforts.

The next reports are due in July. The signatories to the code on Thursday launched a transparency centre allowing EU citizens, researchers and NGOs to access online information about their efforts combating disinformation.

Data on Downdetector showed that at the peak of the outage, more than 60,000 user reports had indicated issues with the video sharing app in the United States alone by 07:20 PM ET. The number of reports have now come down to 700.

Downdetector tracks outages by collating status reports from several sources, including user-submitted errors on its platform.

Meta Inc's (META.O) social media apps and Elon Musk-owned Twitter were also facing problems on Wednesday. Meta's Facebook and Instagram were down for thousands of users in the United States, while some Twitter users were unable to tweet.

356,META,2022-08-29,Chile battles flood of 'half truths' as constitution vote nears,"













SANTIAGO, Aug 29 (Reuters) - A Chilean constitution that bans private property and allows abortions in the ninth month of a pregnancy. Private companies counting votes. A flood of prisoners and recent migrants allowed to vote in the upcoming constitutional referendum.

All these stories have gone viral on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok and WhatsApp in Chile as citizens prepare to vote on a new constitution on Sept. 4, but all are inaccurate.

Nearly 80 percent of Chileans voted to draft a new constitution in 2020, a year after violent protests against inequality rattled the world's top copper-producing nation.

But support has dropped and polls show voters are more likely to reject the new text.

The proposed constitution, written by predominantly independent and progressive elected constituents, is easily available on the streets, online, or in a podcast format. Focusing on social rights and the environment, it is a sharp shift from the current market-oriented constitution that dates back to the Augusto Pinochet era. read more

Paulina Valenzuela, a statistician and managing partner of a public polling company Datavoz, says most misinformation over the past year centered around the constituents who were drawing up the document, but switched to the new text itself after it was completed in early July.

""More than false I'd say they're half truths,"" Valenzuela said. ""Where there's an interpretation of the text, of how the norm or article should be interpreted.""

Valenzuela said it's hard to quantify what impact misinformation has on polls, but 65% of respondents reported encountering misinformation in the last week of July.

Fabian Padilla, who founded Fact Check CL, a fact-checking site that started during the 2019 protests, said sites can't declare legal interpretations false, in contrast to, for example, the kind of patently false medical claims that circulated during the pandemic.

""With Covid, misinformation was very consistent, repeating the same patterns, some of it very absurd,"" Padilla said. ""But with constitutional text it's very debatable.""

This leads to consultations with legal experts and longer verification times.

""It hurts us a lot when there's a fact check that takes us days and we know that just one day more means millions and millions more visits,"" Padilla said.

Marcelo Mendoza, an informatics professor at the computer science department of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, has studied the spread of misinformation in Chile for years.

False claims about the new constitution travel three times faster on Twitter than news from reputable outlets, he said. He added that the false claims make the majority of their impact within 24 hours, a timeframe social media companies struggle to beat.

""They're always getting there late,"" Mendoza said.

The plebiscite itself and Chile's election agency Servel have also been the subjects of misinformation. Servel's President Andres Tagle says this is the fifth election cycle in which the agency has been hit, adding that the attacks have been marked by increasing intensity and a cumulative effect on public trust.

Twitter and Facebook parent Meta said they have been actively working with Chile's government and fact checkers to help stop the spread of misinformation.

""We provided (Servel) with a training session on Twitter Rules while having an open and constant communication with them,"" a Twitter spokesperson told Reuters.

The company did not say how many accounts have been suspended or tweets have been removed but pointed to its Transparency Report. The report says the Chilean government requested information 19 times regarding 33 accounts in the second half of 2021 and the company did not comply in any of those instances.

A Twitter spokesperson, citing privacy concerns, said the company releases non-public information about Twitter users only in response to ""a subpoena, court order, other valid legal process, or in response to a valid emergency request.""

Meta says it activated a rapid-response team on Facebook and Instagram to identify violations, is working with fact checkers including Fast Check CL, and limits the reach of posts found to be misleading.

When it comes to its WhatsApp encrypted messaging system, Meta says it's focusing on reducing the virality of messages, which has reduced the number of forwarded messages by 25% globally since 2020.

But Tagle said he thought the measures still fell short of what is needed. The election agency's president also added that he would like social companies to be regulated by Chilean law, making them responsible for posts if they can't identify the user.

""I don't believe in the social media companies' intentions,"" Tagle said. ""They sell advertising, so when more people see their content, when they see fake things, it's also welcome.""

357,META,2022-07-05,Russian lawmakers approve harsher fines for foreign tech firms without offices,"Summary

Summary Companies This content was produced in Russia where the law restricts coverage of Russian military operations in Ukraine















MOSCOW, July 5 (Reuters) - Russian lawmakers on Tuesday approved a bill providing for stricter penalties for foreign internet companies that fail to open an office in Russia, including fines.

Moscow has long sought to exert greater control over technology firms, and disputes over content and data have intensified since it sent armed forces into Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Foreign social media giants with more than 500,000 daily users have been obliged since July 1, 2021, to open offices in Russia or risk penalties ranging up to outright bans.

Now, the turnover fines that Russia has imposed on the likes of Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google and Meta Platforms (META.O) for hosting banned content could be applied to companies that fail to open offices, after the lower house passed the bill in the second of three readings.

Fines could be as high as 10% of a company's turnover in Russia from the previous year, rising to up to 20% for repeat violations.

The state communications regulator Roskomnadzor last November listed 13 mostly U.S. companies required to set up on Russian soil by the end of the year.

Only Apple (AAPL.O), Spotify (SPOT.N), Rakuten Group's (4755.T) messaging app Viber and the photo-sharing app Likeme have fully complied - though Spotify closed its office in March in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine and subsequently suspended its streaming service.

Meta, which Russia found guilty of ""extremist activity"" in March, is no longer listed, and its Facebook and Instagram platforms are banned, although its messaging app WhatsApp is not.

Four other companies have fulfilled at least one other Roskomnadzor requirement but have not established a Russian legal entity or office. Those were Google, Twitter (TWTR.N), ByteDance's TikTok and Zoom Video Communications (ZM.O), according to the government website.

The chat tool Discord, Amazon's (AMZN.O) live streaming unit Twitch, the messaging app Telegram, the bookmarking service Pinterest (PINS.N) and Wikipedia owner Wikimedia Foundation have taken no steps to comply, according to the website.

WASHINGTON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Kanye West's accounts on Twitter and Instagram were restricted over the weekend, with the social media platforms saying they removed posts by the rapper that online users condemned as anti-Semitic.

West, who legally changed his name to simply Ye last year, was locked out of his Instagram by Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) on Friday. He then moved to Twitter, posting on Saturday for the first time in two years.

West's first post on Twitter since 2020 was a blurry photo of himself singing karaoke with Meta Platforms founder Mark Zuckerberg. The tweet said: ""Look at this Mark How you gone kick me off instagram.""

West then tweeted: ""You guys have toyed with me and tried to black ball anyone whoever opposes your agenda."" That post, in which he said he was not anti-Semitic, was removed by Twitter. His account was also locked, a Twitter spokesperson confirmed on Sunday.

The step by Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) to lock the performer's account was noteworthy because billionaire Elon Musk, who has said he would buy Twitter and calls himself a free speech absolutist, had welcomed West's return to the platform and replied to a post by the rapper tweeting: ""Welcome back to Twitter, my friend!""

On Monday evening Musk said on Twitter that he had talked to West and ""expressed my concerns about his recent tweet, which I think he took to heart.""

West has previously made erratic online posts. Earlier this year, he was suspended from Instagram for 24 hours after he directed racial slurs at comedian Trevor Noah.

Before he took to Twitter early on Saturday, the rapper had his Instagram account suspended after a since-removed post in which he invoked anti-Semitic tropes, accusing a musician of being controlled by ""the Jewish people.""

The company said on Saturday temporary restrictions on posting, commenting and messaging were imposed on West's Instagram account.

The suspension comes days after German sporting goods maker Adidas (ADSGn.DE) said it had put under review its business partnership with West.

CNBC, which first reported the news, said West had been publicly critical of Adidas and its CEO and told the broadcaster that the German group was copying his ideas. Adidas has been partnering with West since 2013, CNBC said. read more

359,META,2023-03-13,Saints involve police after Walker-Peters racially abused online,"













March 13 (Reuters) - Southampton have contacted the police after defender Kyle Walker-Peters received racist abuse on social media following their goalless draw with Manchester United, the Premier League club said on Monday.

Walker-Peters, 25, was targeted online after his challenge on United's Alejandro Garnacho left the 18-year-old winger in pain, forcing manager Erik ten Hag into withdrawing his second-half substitute.

Garnacho later left Old Trafford on crutches, with Ten Hag confirming he had twisted his ankle.

""The racial abuse I received is something that no player or person should ever have to experience,"" Walker-Peters wrote on Instagram.

""We need to be better, and this is bigger than just football. More needs to be done to prevent this from happening time and time again.

""To @garnacho7, it would never be my intention to injure a fellow professional. I wish you a speedy recovery.""

Southampton said in a statement they were ""disgusted and disappointed in the behaviour of those online who lower themselves to abusing players for the colour of their skin"".

""What is equally frustrating is the lack of meaningful action in those two years from the social media platforms who allow such hatred to breed and fester,"" the statement said.

Southampton said they have forwarded the messages to Hampshire Police and reported the posts to the social media platforms.

""We can only hope that they finally pay attention to what continues to be a major problem,"" the club added.

Meta, which owns Instagram, said they have been in touch with the club and removed a number of comments from the platform for breaking their rules.

""Over the last few years, we've launched several ways to help protect people from having to experience abuse in the first place, including our Hidden Words feature which lets people filter offensive comments and DMs,"" a Meta spokesperson said.

""We recently started turning this on by default for people with creator accounts.

""No one thing will fix this overnight, but we'll continue to work to help protect our community from abuse and respond to valid legal requests to support police investigations.""

The abuse was also condemned by the Football Association and the Premier League.

""No one should have to face abuse of this kind. We are supporting Southampton with their investigations,"" the league said.

360,META,2022-11-18,Big Tech layoffs are dystopian job-market fiction,"













NEW YORK, Nov 18 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Layoffs at technology giants including Twitter, Amazon.com (AMZN.O), and Meta Platforms (META.O) mark the first large-scale job cuts since early 2020. After years of falling U.S. unemployment, it might seem like Silicon Valley is foreshadowing the beginning of a dystopian future for workers. Yet there’s a good chance that what happens in Silicon Valley won’t spill over into the rest of the economy.

Tech firms were quick to hire a couple of years ago. After the pandemic hit in 2020, it took four months for employment in what government statistics call the ”other information” sector to return to its pre-Covid level. By comparison, overall employment didn’t recover for 29 months.

Silicon Valley is ahead of the curve on firing too. Rising interest rates are making capital more expensive, which forces companies to clip spending on future projects. That’s particularly burdensome for tech firms that rely heavily on innovation to drive growth. Elon Musk halved Twitter's headcount in November to rein in costs. Employment has since fallen further as disappointed workers resign.

Elsewhere, companies are still recruiting. There were roughly two job openings for every available worker in September. Job listings for restaurant workers were up 38% from the pre-crisis levels as of Nov. 10, according to Indeed. Hospitality and tourism listings sit 15% higher than they were.

Could Silicon Valley’s pains spread? That depends on the Federal Reserve, which has a mandate to bring inflation down from an annual rate of 6.3%, excluding food and energy prices, to its target of 2%. Officials warned in September that the fight would likely bring layoffs and slower hiring. The Fed’s projections see unemployment hit 4.4% in 2024, suggesting roughly 1.2 million more people out of work.

Yet inflation seems to have peaked in June. Fed Governor Christopher Waller suggested on Wednesday that such a trade-off might be avoidable. That raises the hope that what’s coming isn’t even a white-collar recession, but a tech-specific adjustment. That’s not much consolation for workers handing back their door badges. But it suggests that Silicon Valley’s modest cull might be as bad as it gets.

CONTEXT NEWS

Amazon.com, Twitter, Meta Platforms, and other technology companies have collectively laid off tens of thousands of employees in recent weeks as leaders look to cut costs and brace for slower growth.

The Federal Reserve has warned that rising interest rates could lead to higher unemployment. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly emphasized high job openings as a sign that the labor market is imbalanced.

Inflation data published on Nov. 10 showed prices climbing 7.7% in the year through October. That’s down from the prior month’s 8.2% pace.

361,META,2023-01-03,Breakingviews: Disney’s next 100 years hinges on a metaverse,"













NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Mickey Mouse is turning triple digits in 2023. Walt Disney (DIS.N) in October will celebrate its 100th anniversary. In the past century, the Magic Kingdom’s theme parks have survived technological forces. Taking the real Disneyland as a blueprint for the metaverse that marries its brand and streaming ambitions is not hard to fathom.

Disneyland, the theme park business that opened 32 years after the company began, was based on the vision of founder Walt Disney, who oversaw its completion in an orange grove in Anaheim, California. The theme park was revolutionary at the time, because Disney wanted a destination attractive to both kids and adults. Rides and experiences extracted from Disney’s hefty trove of animated characters and movies such as Sleeping Beauty’s Castle and the Mad Tea Party formed the basis for the playbook. The idea expanded and now the company operates parks in Paris, Hong Kong, Shanghai, not to mention the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida.

The theme parks, and their related consumer products, are an increasingly important part of the company. In the year ending September 2018, the division had a chunky 25% operating margin and represented almost 40% of Disney’s total operating profit of $16 billion. The company’s TV and cable assets, like ESPN, are declining. And so, Disney will lean evermore on the theme parks to help it boost profit, and offset losses from the company’s streaming video division. By 2024, the parks, experiences and consumer products’ margins are expected to increase to 30% while accounting for two-thirds of Disney’s operating profit, according to estimates from Goldman Sachs.

In that way, Disney has the blocks for its metaverse. Take the Star Wars franchise. It has spawned over 10 movies, several TV series for the flagship streaming service Disney+ and serves as the backdrop at Disney World for Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser, a two-night immersive experience that mimics life in the faraway galaxy. Creating an augmented reality-based world next is not that far-fetched.

That, however, requires beating a company like Meta Platforms (META.O), which is already spending on its version of the metaverse, to the punch. Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger, who is at his second stint at the helm, will have to hand the reins to someone who can oversee the transition. Tim Sweeney who is ahead of the curve as boss of ""Fortnite"" owner Epic Games, or former Meta executive Carolyn Everson, who is on the Disney board, could lead the way. For the Magic Kingdom, the next century hinges on the virtual world.

362,META,2023-01-20,Breakingviews: Layoffs take Big Tech back to more modest future,"













NEW YORK, Jan 20 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Alphabet’s (GOOGL.O) plan to cut 12,000 jobs adds to the sense that U.S. technology firms are preparing for a more modest future. But it’s still grander than the not-so-distant past.

The Google parent joins rivals Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O), who are firing nearly 40,000 people between them. Tech firms based in the United States announced over 97,000 job cuts in 2022 according to consulting firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, the most since the dot-com crash. Over 80% of these occurred in the final three months of the year. Moreover, new job postings fell sharply at the end of 2022, according to trade group CompTIA.

Reuters Graphics

Even so, the pandemic bounty remains. There were 4.4 million people employed in tech in December, according to provisional figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s an all-time high, and over 440,000 more than in February 2020, the month before Covid-19 hit America. Alphabet, Microsoft, Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) and Amazon all said they are cutting about 5% of employees. If all tech firms did the same, that would leave employment at 4.2 million, or about 5% larger than it was at the end of 2019.

That seems about right. Tech revenue and employment can be volatile, but tends to grow faster than the economy at large. In the period from 2012 to the end of 2019, for example, America’s GDP grew 2.3% annually according to the Federal Reserve, while tech jobs increased at a rate of about 3%. For bosses like Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai or Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, who’d rather not retrench too much, cutting around 5% of staff is enough to show investors they’re serious about costs, without signaling an all-out retreat.

BERLIN, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Germany's cartel office has concluded proceedings against Google (GOOGL.O) over its online news service after the tech giant made several changes benefiting publishers, the office said on Wednesday.

The office said Google had abandoned plans to integrate the Google News Showcase into general searches and changed its contractual practice to make sure publishers do not face difficulties in asserting their ancillary copyright in response to its concerns.

A publisher's participation in the News Showcase will continue not to affect search results, added the office.

The cartel office said Google would implement further measures in the coming weeks, including providing more information about Showcase, and that it would continue to monitor this development.

Under expanded powers that entered into force last year, the cartel office has taken up cases involving several tech giants, including Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Facebook owner Meta .

REUTERS/Jim Bourg















March 17 (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Donald Trump posted to YouTube and Facebook on Friday, in a return to the tech platforms he used to power his political rise until he was cut off following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on Congress by his followers.

The posts on his Facebook page and YouTube channel, which were titled ""I'M BACK!,"" show a CNN video announcing Trump's election as president in the 2016 race against Hillary Clinton. It then fades to a 'Trump 2024' screen.

""Sorry to keep you waiting,"" Trump says in the video.

Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) YouTube restored Trump's channel earlier on Friday. Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) had reinstated Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts earlier this year.

His Twitter account was reinstated in November by the platform's new owner Elon Musk but Trump has yet to post on Twitter.

Trump powered his improbable 2016 presidential campaign through his use of social media. His return gives him access to key vehicles for political fundraising, allowing him to reach a combined 146 million followers across three major tech platforms as he makes another run for the presidency in 2024.

""We carefully evaluated the continued risk of real-world violence, while balancing the chance for voters to hear equally from major national candidates in the run up to an election,"" YouTube said in a tweet, referring to its move to restore his account.

Trump's campaign team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

His campaign spokesman told Fox News Digital in January that being back on Facebook ""will be an important tool for the 2024 campaign to reach voters.""

The former president founded his own social media platform called Truth Social in late 2021, which he relied on to communicate with supporters during his ban from Twitter and Meta.

YouTube banned Trump in 2021 for violating its policy against inciting violence after his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol as Congress was certifying Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election.

Opponents of Trump's return point to his messages on Truth Social, where he has nearly 5 million followers, as evidence that he still poses the same risk that led to his suspensions.

Trump's return to YouTube and Facebook is happening just as the Manhattan District Attorney's office is considering criminal charges related to hush-money payments made to a porn star during Trump's 2016 campaign, charges that Trump and his allies are arguing without evidence are politically motivated.

Trump also faces a $250 million civil fraud lawsuit brought by New York state, alleging a decade-long scheme to manipulate more than 200 asset valuations and Trump's net worth to win better terms from banks and insurers. Trump has called the suit a witch hunt.

365,META,2022-07-11,Zayo launches subsea cable route connecting Britain and Europe,"













STOCKHOLM, July 11 (Reuters) - U.S. communications infrastructure provider (ZAYOG.UL) on Monday said it has launched the Zeus subsea route connecting the UK and continental Europe as cloud service providers seek faster internet connection.

Undersea cables transmit nearly all the world's internet data traffic, and many technology companies, including Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google and Meta have also invested in building their own subsea cables.

Zayo, which was bought by investment firms Digital Colony Partners LP and EQT for about $8.2 billion in 2019, owns several terrestrial fibre routes in the UK, Ireland and several European countries.

The new subsea cable, which was announced last year, will have access points in Lowestoft, U.K. and Zandvoort, the Netherlands.

""From a data center standpoint, London, Amsterdam and Frankfurt for us are the most critical routes, so that's why we decided to go first with that one,"" Yannick Leboyer, Zayo's chief operating officer for Europe, said in an interview.

""It's probably the riskiest investment we have done in Europe in many years,"" he said. ""When we kicked this off there were no customers, but now we have customers.""

Zayo did not give details of its investment.

366,META,2022-10-20,Amazon faces $1 bln lawsuit in UK for 'favouring its own products',"Summary

Summary Companies Consumer rights advocate bringing case for customers

Amazon says collective action is 'without merit'

Case focuses on marketplace's 'Buy Box' feature















LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) is facing a lawsuit in Britain for damages of up to 900 million pounds ($1 billion) over allegations the online marketplace abused its dominant position by favouring its own products, lawyers said.

Consumer rights advocate Julie Hunter plans to bring the collective action on behalf of British consumers who have made purchases on Amazon since October 2016, lawyers representing her said.

The proposed case - which Amazon said was ""without merit"" - would be the latest mass action against a tech giant to be filed at London’s Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT).

Law firm Hausfeld, which represents Hunter, said on Thursday that Amazon has breached competition law by using “a secretive and self-favouring algorithm” to promote its own products through the “Buy Box” feature on its website.

Hunter said in a statement: “Far from being a recommendation based on price or quality, the Buy Box favours products sold by Amazon itself, or by retailers who pay Amazon for handling their logistics. Other sellers, however good their offers might be, are effectively shut out.”

An Amazon spokesperson said in a statement: “This claim is without merit and we’re confident that will become clear through the legal process.”

The lawsuit is expected to be filed at the CAT by the end of this month and will have to be certified by the tribunal before it can proceed.

It is being brought on an “opt-out” basis, meaning that any potential claimants will be included in the claim unless they choose to opt out.

The case follows the announcement by Britain’s antitrust watchdog in July that it is investigating Amazon over suspected breaches of competition law, including how it selects which products are placed within the “Buy Box” feature.

Amazon has faced similar probes elsewhere, recently making an offer to the European Commission to avert possible hefty EU antitrust fines.

The platform has also declined to describe its product-search system to an Australian competition regulator which has heard complaints of large marketplace platforms giving preference to in-house wares.

The CAT authorised an estimated 920 milion-pound ($1.1 billion) damages claim against Google (GOOGL.O) in July and approved another case worth up to 1.7 billion pounds against Apple (AAPL.O) in May.

The tribunal is also due to decide in January whether to give the go-ahead to a claim valued at up to 2.2 billion pounds against Meta Platforms (META.O), the owner of Facebook and Instagram, over alleged anti-competitive behaviour.

Google and Apple deny the allegations against them, according to court filings, and Meta did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

(Reuters) - Latham & Watkins said Tuesday that Michele Anderson, former associate director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Corporation Finance, is joining the firm as a partner in Washington, D.C.

Oct 15 (Reuters) - Brentford have condemned racist abuse directed at striker Ivan Toney via a direct message on social media following the side's 2-0 win over Brighton & Hove Albion in the Premier League.

Toney shared images of the messages he received on Instagram, with the caption: ""I wasn't even going to post this but I woke up angry"".

Brentford said the abusive message was sent on Friday, after Toney scored twice in the match in West London.

""We condemn this discriminatory behaviour in the strongest possible terms. An attack on one of our players is an attack on all of us,"" Brentford said in a statement on Saturday.

""We expect strong support from the police, legal authorities and from Instagram's parent company, Meta, to ensure that the individual involved faces the full force of the law for this despicable hate crime.""

Toney has been a key player for Brentford this season with eight goals and three assists in 11 games in all competitions for the West London club.

369,META,2023-03-09,US FTC will seek to stop ICE from buying Black Knight,"













WASHINGTON, March 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Thursday said it would take action aimed at stopping New York Stock Exchange parent Intercontinental Exchange (ICE.N) from acquiring mortgage data vendor Black Knight (BKI.N) in a $13.1 billion deal.

The agency said the proposed deal would mean higher fees, less innovation and fewer choices in the process of financing the purchase of a home.

""This deal would reduce competition in key areas of the mortgage process, ultimately raising costs for lenders and homebuyers,"" said Patty Brink, acting deputy director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition.

The FTC voted 4-0 to bring an administrative complaint.

ICE said in a statement that it would ""vigorously oppose"" the FTC action.

""The proposed acquisition can bring to life a true end-to-end solution for the mortgage industry, benefiting aspiring and current homeowners across the United States,"" said Tim Bowler, president of ICE Mortgage Technology.

Under President Joe Biden, who has promised tougher antitrust enforcement, the FTC has sued to stop an unusually large number of deals, and many companies terminated their transactions without a fight. One exception was Facebook parent Meta, which battled the FTC over its plan to buy virtual reality company Within Unlimited. The court ruled for Meta and the FTC dropped its opposition.

The ICE deal for Black Knight, which was announced in May, prompted worries from the beginning that it could raise costs for consumers by giving ICE too much pricing power in the mortgage data market that lenders rely on.

Black Knight, which provides software, data and analytics to the real estate and housing finance markets, is the latest in a string of deals undertaken by ICE since 2016 to support its mortgage-servicing business as it bets on a windfall from automation of the home financing process.

In 2020 ICE, in an $11-billion deal, purchased Ellie Mae, a cloud-based platform that supports all aspects of mortgage origination. That followed a $335-million deal for Simplifile in 2019, and the acquisition of MERS, in which ICE took a majority stake in 2016 and bought outright in 2018.

In February, Reuters reported that Black Knight had decided to put its Empower loan origination software business up for sale in a response to U.S. antitrust concerns.

The FTC said in a statement that the proposed asset sale was inadequate to address the harm that the transaction would do.

The Community Home Lenders Association, which opposed the deal, has argued that Empower and ICE's Encompass unit are the top two vendors for loan origination software, jointly controlling upwards of 60% of the market.

370,META,2022-05-24,Oh Snap! Social media stocks lose billions after Snapchat parent warning,"













May 24 (Reuters) - Snap Inc (SNAP.N) shares plunged more than 40% and sparked a sector-wide selloff on Tuesday after a profit warning from the Snapchat parent signaled tough times ahead for the once-booming digital ad industry.

The company was on track to lose $15 billion in market capitalization, while shares of major online advertisers and social-media firms were set to lose a combine $200 billion in value from the rout.

Snap shares closed at $12.79, lower than their 2017 IPO price of $17.

Meta Platforms (FB.O), Pinterest (PINS.N), Twitter (TWTR.N) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O)dropped between 5% and 24%.

Snap said on Monday it was expecting to miss quarterly revenue and profit targets set just a month earlier and would have to slow hiring and lower spending.

Valuations for social media stocks are coming back down to earth after the companies posted unprecedented growth last year when advertisers began to recover from the pandemic, said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at ad agency GroupM.

""There's a resetting of expectations,"" he said, adding that while economic problems like inflation are partly hurting revenue, Snap and other platforms have also overestimated their ability to maintain break-neck growth.

Even so, Snap's valuation of nearly 15 times 2024 estimated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, according to Refinitiv data, was significantly higher than Alphabet's 8.5 times and Meta's six times.

The bleak view from one of the sector's well-known names underlines the impact of the Ukraine war, surging inflation and rising interest rates on social media companies just when they were trying to shake off the hit from changes to Apple's iOS operating system. read more

""Snap is a proxy for online advertising and when you see weakness there then you automatically think Facebook, Pinterest and Google,"" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Bright Trading LLC.

""Once you start thinking about Google, that's when the markets start to sell off.""

Snap and its peers including Meta are in the path of a storm that also includes increasing competition from TikTok for users' attention and ad dollars, said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at research firm Insider Intelligence.

Tuesday's selloff comes days after a Bank of America fund managers survey indicated investors are becoming increasingly bearish on tech stocks, a stark reversal to a bullish trend in the past 14 years.

Analysts said Snap's outlook for core profit suggested expenses will outpace its revenue growth, given headcount was up 52% in the prior quarter.

""There's a lot to deal with in the macro environment today,"" Chief Executive Officer Evan Spiegel said at a tech conference on Monday.

BRUSSELS, July 7 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are investigating the video licensing policy of the Alliance for Open Media (AOM), whose members include Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Meta , the European Commission said on Thursday.

The investigation is the latest to hit the tech industry, which will be subject to tough new rules in Europe next year that could force companies to change their core business models and do more to tackle illegal content on their platforms.

""The Commission confirms that it has a preliminary investigation ongoing into AOM's licensing policy,"" a spokesperson for the EU executive told Reuters.

""The fact that the Commission has a preliminary investigation does not prejudge the outcome of the investigation on the existence of an infringement,"" the spokesperson said, without providing further details.

AOM did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Founded in 2015, the group aims to create a new standard software for streaming higher-quality 4K video on browsers, devices, apps, and gaming, known as AV1.

While the AV1 software is not yet adopted widely, Netflix (NFLX.O) and YouTube have started using it for some customers, and browsers such as Google Chrome and Firefox have started to support the new format.

Apple and Google did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Meta and Amazon declined to comment. Microsoft (MSFT.O), Netflix, Broadcom (AVGO.O), Cisco (CSCO.O) and Tencent (0700.HK), who are also AOM members, did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.

Intel (INTC.O), Huawei (HWT.UL), Mozilla, Samsung (005930.KS) and Nvidia (NVDA.O) are also AOM members, according to its website.

In a questionnaire sent to some companies earlier this year and seen by Reuters, the EU watchdog said it was investigating alleged anti-competitive behaviour related to the license terms of AV1 by AOM and its members in Europe.

""The Commission has information that AOM and its members may be imposing licensing terms (mandatory royalty-free cross licensing) on innovators that were not a part of AOM at the time of the creation of the AV1 technical, but whose patents are deemed essential to (its) technical specifications,"" the paper said.

It said this action may be restricting the innovators' ability to compete with the AV1 technical specification, and also eliminate incentives for them to innovate.

The questionnaire also asked about the impact of an AOM patent license clause in which licensees would have their patent licenses terminated immediately if they launched patent lawsuits asserting that implementation infringes their claims.

Companies risk fines of up to 10% of their global turnover for breaching EU antitrust rules.

June 21 (Reuters) - The Telegram messaging app, used by a wide range of Russian and Ukrainian officials during the war, only needs a small number of paid subscribers to cover its costs, founder Pavel Durov said on Tuesday.

Telegram Premium service users will get a higher limit for chats, media and file uploads, Durov said on June 10, noting that paid subscriptions would ensure the app remains funded primarily by users and not advertisers. read more

Telegram and Signal have signed up more messaging users due to growing concerns about privacy on larger rival WhatsApp, owned by Meta Platforms Inc (META.O). Telegram has 500 million monthly active users and is one of the 10 most downloaded apps in the world, according to its website.

Jan 26 (Reuters) - Spotify Technology SA's (SPOT.N) music streaming platform suffered a brief outage on Thursday, leaving tens of thousands of users unable to access the platform before services appeared to come back online.

""Everything's looking much better now,"" Spotify Status, an account that provides updates about the platform's status, said in a tweet.

In the second such outage within two weeks, more than 41,000 Spotify users reported on Downdetector.com they were having issues with the streaming platform at the peak of the disruption.

As Spotify was coming back online, Downdetector said reports of outages had fallen below 2,000.

Spotify suffered a brief outage earlier this month, with more than 45,000 affected users from the United States at the peak of the disruption.

Summary

Summary Companies Mass tech layoffs spawn new wave of startups

Early-stage VC funding at around record levels

Echoes of dotcom crash that fueled Facebook, others















Jan 3 (Reuters) - Nic Szerman lost his job at Meta Platforms (META.O) in November, just two months after joining full-time, falling victim to a sweeping 13% reduction of its workforce as the advertising market cratered.

Days later he was back working, seeking investment for his own company Nulink, a blockchain-based payment company, and sent pitches to startup accelerator Y Combinator and Andreessen Horowitz’s cryptocurrency fund.

""As counterintuitive as it may sound, this layoff left me in a really good position,"" the 24-year-old said. ""Because I don't have to pay back the sign-on bonus, I get four months of pay, and now I have time to focus on my own project.""

Szerman is part of a wave of would-be entrepreneurs who are emerging from the ashes of the mass job losses seen in Silicon Valley in the second half of 2022, according to venture capitalists.

U.S. tech giants including Meta, Microsoft (MSFT.O), Twitter and Snap (SNAP.N) have purged more than 150,000 staff, according to Layoff.fyi, which tracks technology job losses.

While overall venture capital (VC) financing fell 33% globally to about $483 billion in 2022, early-stage funding was robust, with $37.4 billion raised in so-called angel or seed rounds, in line with the record level seen in 2021, according to data from research firm PitchBook.

Day One Ventures, an early stage venture fund in San Francisco, launched a new initiative in November to fund startups founded by people who had been laid off from their tech jobs, touting the slogan ""Funded, not Fired"".

The program aims to cut 20 checks for $100,000 by the end of 2022. Day One said it had received over 1,000 applications, most of them from people who were cut loose by Meta, Stripe and Twitter.

""We're investing $2 million in 20 companies - if we just find one unicorn it almost returns the fund, which I think is a really unique opportunity for us as fund managers,"" said Masha Bucher, co-founder at Day One Ventures.

""Looking at the last economic cycle, companies like Stripe, Airbnb, Dropbox have been created in crisis.""

HOT: GAMING AND AI

Also in November, multi-stage fund Index Ventures, which has bankrolled Facebook, Etsy and Skype, launched its second Origins fund, which will invest $300 million in early-stage startups.

Silicon Valley investor U.S. Venture Partners and Austrian VC firm Speedinvest have meanwhile earmarked a similar amount for newly founded companies.

Investors highlighted gaming and artificial intelligence among hot areas of interest.

""With advances in game design, new innovations like cloud gaming, and the emergence of social networking in this sphere, gaming has really transcended into mainstream culture,"" said Sofia Dolfe, partner at Index Ventures.

""In every period of economic uncertainty, there is opportunity - to reset, re-prioritize and re-focus energy and resources.""

DOTCOM BUBBLE 2.0

Szerman said his project was rejected by Y Combinator, while he hasn't heard back from Andreessen Horowitz yet, though he added that other early-stage venture capitalists had expressed interest.

""I told the investors we'll chat in two or three months,"" he added. ""I'll focus on scaling the system now.""

Some investors compared the 2022 downturn to the dotcom crash of the early 2000s, when dozens of overvalued startups went bust, flooding the market with talent and helping to spark a wave of new companies such as Facebook and YouTube.

""Many great companies have been created in relatively dark times,"" said Harry Nelis, partner at investment firm Accel, who sees a new generation of risk takers emerge among the swathe of people left unemployed.

Some industry players say former Big Tech employees are uniquely placed to start their own companies, having seen first-hand how some of the biggest firms in the world operate, and enjoying ongoing access to their network of highly skilled colleagues.

One former Googler has sought to help others like him looking for life after technology giants. In 2015, Christopher Fong, who spent almost a decade working for the tech titan in California, launched Xoogler, a project designed to help former employees hoping to start their own companies. Since then, the group's membership has since swelled to more than 11,000.

Fong told Reuters that experience in Big Tech firm gave founders a ""strong brand that can be leveraged to meet investors, potential customers, and recruit team members"".

377,META,2022-11-17,Roku becomes latest firm to reduce staff with 200 job cuts,"













Nov 17 (Reuters) - Roku Inc (ROKU.O) said on Thursday it would cut 200 jobs in the United States, becoming the latest tech company to lay off workers amid an economic slowdown and decades-high inflation.

Tech companies including Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and Snap Inc have reduced staff this year as they grapple with a slowdown in growth and mounting costs.

The video-streaming device maker expects to book a charge between $28 million and $31 million in the fourth quarter related to the layoffs, mainly severance payments and associated costs.

Shares in Roku, which said layoffs would cut staff expenses by an estimated 5%, fell 2% in trading before the bell.

The company's shares have plunged about 75% this year as inflation and the risks of a looming recession have cut ad-spending budgets. read more

Roku, which blamed ""current economic conditions"" for the cuts, had 3,000 full-time employees in 13 countries as of Dec. 31 last year.

379,META,2022-10-28,"Social media failing to keep up with Brazil electoral disinformation, rights groups say","













SAO PAULO, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Human rights groups and researchers have raised concerns in Brazil that social media platforms are failing to effectively police disinformation ahead of a highly polarized presidential vote on Sunday.

Brazil's Superior Electoral Court (TSE) bolstered measures this month to tackle disinformation around the election, especially on video sharing platforms. Sunday's runoff vote pits far-right President Jair Bolsonaro against leftist former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.

Groups that monitor the online spaces told Reuters that tech companies are still struggling to follow through on agreements they signed with the TSE in February, in which they promised to combat material that could undermine the democratic process.

The TSE did not respond to a request for comment.

""Social media platforms are failing Brazil's voters,"" said Deborah Brown, a senior researcher on digital rights at Human Rights Watch, who called the platforms and messaging apps ""extremely important"" spaces for electoral debate.

""That space has been riddled with electoral disinformation, such as baseless allegations of electoral fraud,"" she said.

Bolsonaro, who is narrowly trailing Lula in recent opinion polls, has repeatedly criticized the country's electronic voting machines for allegedly being vulnerable to fraud, without providing evidence, raising concerns that he might not concede defeat if he loses.

Jon Lloyd, senior advisor at UK-based Global Witness, said the platforms have ""many correct policies"" in place to combat disinformation but ""the enforcement is really lacking.""

""They're not actually following through on what their policies say and that's a big concern,"" he said.

Online disinformation has intensified since Brazil's first round of voting on Oct. 2, according to Philip Friedrich, a senior research analyst for technology and elections at Freedom House.

""Social media companies bear some responsibility for the country being on tenterhooks about this year's election,"" Friedrich said. ""While major social media companies like Twitter and Meta released statements about their preparations before the first round of voting, we've seen few updates about how they are responding to shifts in disinformation.""

An explosion of video-based platforms has also added to the difficulty of fighting disinformation compared to past elections, said Brazil researcher Rosana Pinheiro-Machado at Dublin's University College.

""The last election was the election of WhatsApp. This is the election of Tiktok and Instagram,"" she said.

TikTok said in a statement to Reuters ""we take our responsibility to protect the integrity of our platform and elections with utmost seriousness.""

A spokesperson for Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said: “We’ve prepared extensively for the 2022 election in Brazil,"" adding that around 30 million people in Brazil have clicked on the electoral label on Facebook and have been directed to the TSE's website.

Twitter (TWTR.N) and YouTube, which is owned by Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O), did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

380,META,2022-07-25,Tech investors may be overvaluing moats,"













NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Technology investing is mostly about carving out a business that can’t be copied and reaping monopoly-style margins. Investors seem to think Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Apple (AAPL.O) have done this, but they may be overvaluing the moats.

Over the past year, Meta Platforms (META.O) and Netflix (NFLX.O) valuations have been pounded as competition in advertising and video streaming has caused investors to reassess growth prospects. Meta’s stock, for example, has lost half its value since the start of 2022 as tech giants Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Apple are expanding fast in advertising. The rise of TikTok makes the walls surrounding ad-dependent social networks in particular look flimsy read more . Similarly, the growth of streaming services from Apple, Walt Disney (DIS.N) and others have slowed subscriber growth at Netflix to a crawl and pressured margins.

Investors have fewer worries when it comes to Microsoft and Apple. With Apple’s first quarter market share of North American mobile phone shipments exceeding 50%, according to Canalys, it is increasingly inconceivable to think that users will ditch their iPhones. And it’s credible to think the $2.5 trillion company’s Chief Executive Tim Cook will have success selling more advertising and financial services to its customers. It’s even harder to imagine companies abandoning their workplace software, run by Microsoft, which, for example, holds 85% of the market share in U.S. public sector productivity software, according to Omdia.

And yet valuation multiples reflect these relative expectations, and then some. The stock price of Meta has corrected so much, its enterprise value is now worth less than 4 times estimated revenue for the next 12 months. Five years ago, that metric was 9 times, according to Datastream. Netflix has an enterprise value of 3 times estimated revenue for the next 12 months, half its valuation five years ago. Meantime, Apple, at 6 times, is twice its valuation from five years ago. Likewise, Microsoft’s multiple has risen 60% to over 8 times.

The buffers for the latter two companies are assailable. Rivals still want to steal customers, antitrust regulators can’t be dismissed entirely, and the biggest threat – these firms miss out on a market shift as tech advances – remains. While moats protect against rivals, they may do little against a recessionary wave that smashes earnings in the sector overall. Technology investors may be right on their assessment, but wrong on the way they are valuing it.

Oct 4 (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N) employees will have to come in to office twice a week, the company said on Tuesday, at a time when companies worldwide are adapting to hybrid working models.

Tech giants such as Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) opted for flexible working policies early on during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Peer Lyft (LYFT.O) in March shifted to a 'fully flexible' work option, allowing workers the choice of where to live and work.

Uber announced Tuesdays and Thursdays as ""anchor days"" where all non-remote employees must work from office globally, starting Nov. 1.

The ride-hailing service, however, added that employees could work from anywhere for up to four weeks per year. Last July, it had said it will let staff work from anywhere as much as half the time.

Dec 6 (Reuters) - BuzzFeed Inc (BZFD.O) will cut about 12% of its workforce to rein in costs, the online media company said on Tuesday, as it joins a growing number of U.S. firms that have taken similar measures in anticipation of a potential economic downturn.

As of Dec. 31, BuzzFeed had 1,522 employees across six countries, according to a regulatory filing.

""Our revenues are being impacted by a combination of worsening macroeconomic conditions, and the ongoing audience shift to vertical video, which is still developing from a monetization standpoint,"" Chief Executive Officer Jonah Peretti said in a letter to affected employees.

""That requires us to lower our costs. Unfortunately, reducing our workforce is an essential part of cost cutting. Staff salaries are the single largest cost at the company.""

Peretti said he expected the economic downturn to extend well into 2023.

Several technology companies, including Meta Platforms (META.O), Twitter Inc and Snap Inc (SNAP.N), have cut jobs and scaled back hiring in recent months as higher interest rates, rising inflation and an energy crisis in Europe start to take a toll on the economy.

Companies Law firms Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP Follow















(Reuters) - Stephen Swedlow, the co-managing partner of law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan's Chicago office, is set to leave his litigation practice to join the Cook County bench.

Swedlow's six-year term as a Cook County circuit judge will begin Dec. 5, about a month after he ran unopposed in the Nov. 8 election.

Swedlow has represented both plaintiffs and defendants in private practice at Quinn Emanuel, playing lead roles in trade secrets litigation against Apple Inc and class action claims against Facebook.

Partner profits averaged $5.74 million at the firm last year, according to The American Lawyer. As a Cook County circuit judge, Swedlow will make $216,297 a year.

Swedlow contributed $950,000 to his own campaign, according state election disclosures.

New judges are assigned to the Cook County court's traffic division, which is a ""good training ground"" for incoming judges, a court spokesperson said.

In an email, Swedlow said joining the judiciary was a goal ever since he clerked from 1995 to 1996 for Jerome Farris, a judge of the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals who died in 2020.

""It will be a big change to be the judge and I might miss the competition of being a litigant at trial,"" Swedlow said. ""I have achieved pretty much all that can be achieved in civil practice and have tried to leave all my cases and clients to other QE partners.""

At Quinn Emanuel, Swedlow was the lead attorney for a class of health insurers who won $3.7 billion from the federal government under an Obamacare program, earning a $185 million fee award for the firm.

A group of insurers has asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to overturn to overturn the fee award, calling it ""untenable.""

Swedlow was also the co-lead counsel for a class of plaintiffs who claim Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc exploited user data to thwart industry competitors. Meta has denied the claims.

Last week, Quinn Emanuel informed the federal judge overseeing the case, U.S. District Judge James Donato, about Swedlow's impending departure from the firm and asked that he be replaced as co-lead counsel by Kevin Teruya, a Los Angeles-based partner.

Swedlow is one of at least two Chicago lawyers who will be leaving private practice at a large law firm for the Cook County bench. The other is Michael Weaver, the pro bono litigation partner at McDermott Will & Emery.

Weaver did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did a spokesperson for McDermott.

It is common for Cook County judicial races to have competitive Democratic primaries but unopposed general contests — the Nov. 8 general election had only one contested judicial race between a Democrat and a Republican.

Swedlow defeated fellow Democrat Jennifer Bae, the employee discipline director at the Cook County Sheriff's Office, in June.

Weaver beat civil litigator Deidre Baumann and Cook County prosecutor Paul Joyce in the Democratic primary.

OAKLAND, Calif., Sept 13 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google must face all but one antitrust allegation about its online advertising business brought in a lawsuit by attorneys general for Texas and 16 other states or territories, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday.

Google won its motion to dismiss an allegation that a cooperation agreement it struck with Meta Platforms' (META.O) Facebook in 2018 was an unlawful restraint of trade, with U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel saying the companies had valid business reasons for the deal.

Google failed to convince Castel to dismiss three other counts related to its market power, though the judge found that some underlying claims by the states lacked merit.

Google said in a blog post on Tuesday that the decision underscored how Texas' case ""is deeply flawed.""

Texas' attorney general's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The antitrust case is one of several against Google and other big tech companies that could go to trial over the next couple of years.

The two firms, Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro and Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, were appointed last year as co-lead counsel for a group of consumers who claim Facebook exploited user data to maintain its market power. The company has denied the claims.

As part of mounting friction in the case between the two firms, Hagens Berman in court documents suggested Quinn Emanuel didn't value women colleagues, while Quinn Emanuel accused its rival of a ""power grab"" and making ""offensive"" personal attacks.

The quarreling over leadership intensified this week as the firms weighed how to replace one of the co-leaders in the case, who is leaving for an elected judicial post in Chicago.

Hagens Berman and another firm asked a judge to not just accept another Quinn Emanuel partner to join the leadership but also to name a third attorney from another firm who has been involved in the case.

Quinn Emanuel proposed keeping the leadership structure in place, calling the appointment of a new lawyer an ""opportunistic and unnecessary power grab.""

A spokesperson for Hagens Berman on Tuesday did not immediately comment. A representative from Quinn Emanuel did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

Central to the fight, Hagens Berman asked U.S. District Judge James Donato to appoint Brian Clark of Lockridge Grindal Nauen as co-counsel. Clark has served on the plaintiffs' executive committee for the consumer class.

Hagens Berman partner Shana Scarlett and Clark said the current leadership structure ""has not been without its challenges."" Scarlett and Clark said Quinn Emanuel was not regularly sharing billing records as part of a routine review process.

""Although finding equality in the law is a complicated topic, promoting men who can respect the voices of female counsel is one place to start,"" Scarlett and Clark wrote.

Quinn Emanuel's Stephen Swedlow, co-lead counsel but who is leaving the firm to join a Chicago court as a judge, fired back within hours.

In his court filing, Swedlow said the suggestion his firm doesn't ""respect"" women attorneys was an ""offensive, unprofessional, and unsupported"" attack.

Swedlow declined to comment, and Scarlett did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

The case is Klein v. Meta Platforms Inc, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 5:20-cv-08570.

For consumer class: Shana Scarlett of Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro; Stephen Swedlow of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan

387,META,2023-02-11,"Wall Street Week Ahead: Last year's laggards lead U.S. stocks' 2023 rebound, for now","













NEW YORK, Feb 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks that took a beating last year are surging in the early weeks of 2023, leading markets higher. Some investors believe that trend is unlikely to last.

Stunning gains in shares of companies such as Nvidia (NVDA.O), Netflix (NFLX.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O) are lifting sectors that struggled in last year’s selloff, including technology (.SPLRCT), and communication services (.SPLRCL).

Smaller stocks that tumbled in 2022 have also burst out of the gate: a Goldman Sachs basket of unprofitable tech stocks that tumbled over 60% in 2022 has rebounded 21% in 2023, dwarfing the S&P 500’s 6.5% gain.

A range of factors are driving the moves, including the attractiveness of beaten-up shares, a tailwind from falling bond yields and market participants unwinding bearish bets against stocks.

Some investors, however, are skeptical that the gains will last, especially if markets continue recalibrating expectations for how high the Federal Reserve will need to raise rates this year to keep cooling off inflation.

While it’s not unusual to see a reversal of trends to begin a year, ""the extent to which it’s occurred is pretty dramatic,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital. “It certainly can’t continue at the extremes it has been.”

Greenwood Capital recently sold at least a portion of its shares in some 2023 winners, including Meta Platforms and Netflix. Meta is up 45% so far this year, while Netflix is up almost 18%. Those stocks fell 64% and 51% last year, respectively.

The S&P 500 jumped 6.2% in January as many investors rushed to raise their equity positioning after whittling it down last year, encouraged by several months of easing inflation readings. One measure, equity positioning for systematic investors, has climbed to its highest in a year, according to a report from Deutsche Bank issued Feb 3.

Moderating bond yields, which surged in 2022 as the Fed raised interest rates to fight soaring inflation, bolstered the case for scooping up last year's losers. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell about 40 basis points during the first few weeks of the year to 3.4% at the start of February after reaching 15-year highs last year.

While falling yields often increase the allure of equities in general, they are particularly beneficial for the technology and growth stocks whose valuations suffered when yields shot higher in 2022.

“When interest rates fall, lower quality, longer duration assets do well,"" said Rob Almeida, global investment strategist at MFS Investment Management.

Yields have headed higher again in recent days, however, as investors raised estimates for how high the Fed will lift rates and how long the central bank will keep them at peak levels. That's weighed on stocks in the latest week, which saw the S&P 500 lose 1.1% after two straight weeks of gains.

""The market leaders to-date ... are vulnerable to the higher-for-longer interest rates and a slowing economy,"" strategists at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute said in a note Thursday. ""We do not view the recent breadth and leadership as sustainable -- yet -- and prefer not to chase equity rallies at this time.""

Investors will be closely watching Tuesday's release of U.S. consumer price data for signs that inflation is continuing to moderate.

David Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors, is skeptical of the latest rally and some of the stocks leading the current run. His firm is underweight many of the big tech and growth stocks that have rebounded in 2023, preferring healthcare and defense shares and keeping a big allocation in cash.

“Either the deterioration last year from an overvalued space is over, or this is a dead cat bounce in a wounded large sector and the bear market of last year is not over,"" Kotok said. ""I am in the latter camp.”

To be sure, there are some signs the leaders could continue to do well.

Since 1990, the three best-performing sectors in January went on to post an average return of 11.3% over the next 12 months versus the S&P 500’s average gain of 9.3% over that time, according to investment research firm CFRA Research.

Matt Stucky, senior portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company, said some of last year’s most beaten-up stocks could continue moving higher in the near term as investors cover more short positions.

Short sellers have covered $51 billion of their bearish bets so far in 2023, or about 6% of total shares shorted, including over $1 billion in shorts each related to Amazon (AMZN.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O), shares, according to financial and analytics firm S3 Partners.

“Can this last a quarter or two? Yes,"" Stucky said. ""Can it last for the entirety of 2023 or a multiyear period? Likely not.""

388,META,2022-08-31,Apple chief privacy officer set to leave company for law firm -Bloomberg News,"













Aug 30 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) Chief Privacy Officer Jane Horvath will be leaving the company soon to work at a law firm, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday citing people familiar with the matter.

Horvath, who joined Apple in 2011, is taking a job at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, the report said. (https://bloom.bg/3pVA6zI)

The iPhone maker's top privacy executive, who is also a lawyer, had previously served in key privacy roles at Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google the U.S. Department of Justice, as per her LinkedIn profile.

Horvath was hired to formalize privacy practices after the 2011 ""locationgate"" scandal, in which iPhones were found to be gathering information about users' whereabouts.

The reported move by Horvath also comes after Apple upended the digital ad industry by introducing new iPhone privacy controls last year, which hurt the ability for firms like Meta (META.O) and Snap (SNAP.N) to target and measure ads on their apps.

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.

389,META,2023-01-27,Apple developing software to help users build apps for upcoming headset - The Information,"













Jan 27 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is developing software to help users of its upcoming mixed-reality (MR) headset build their own augmented reality apps, the Information reported on Friday, citing four people who worked on the headset.

According to a Bloomberg News report, the company was in talks with about half a dozen media partners including Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) to develop virtual reality content for its MR headset.

The iPhone maker did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Mixed reality is one of three types of extended reality technologies often associated with the metaverse. An MR headset could allow the wearer to use a real-world object to trigger a virtual-world reaction.

The iPhone maker's MR headset is set to launch in this year's spring event and will cost around $3,000, according to a separate Bloomberg News report.

That would be twice as much as Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) Quest Pro virtual and mixed reality headset, which was launched late last year for $1,500.

390,META,2022-12-13,Apple plans to let rival app stores on iPhones in EU -Bloomberg,"













Dec 13 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is preparing to allow alternative app stores on its iPhones and iPads in the European Union as soon as late next year to comply with a new European competition law it had fought, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.

Opening up to outside app stores could present a major threat to Apple's fast-growing services business, but rivals would first have to surmount the hurdle of convincing consumers to leave the security and simplicity of using Apple's own store.

The magnitude of consequences depends on how the U.S. company complies with additional mandates in the European law, known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA).

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and other companies with app stores could receive boosts to sales as a result of Apple's planned change on rival storefronts.

Apple declined to comment. Meta, Amazon and Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment but a coalition of app makers said Apple must fully comply with the DMA to truly open competition.

As part of the reportedly planned change, Apple customers could ultimately install apps without using the company's App Store. But Apple has not made decisions on whether to comply with other provisions of the law, such as allowing for alternative payment systems to its own.

Permitting its payment tool to be bypassed would threaten billions of dollars in revenue Apple collects from charging a commission of up to 30% on App Store purchases.

About $10 billion worth of transactions flowed through the App Store last year, according to estimates from Sensor Tower, a mobile analytics company. At least 70% of the funds go to app makers.

Angelo Zino, a stock analyst at CFRA, said he expects under 0.2% of Apple's total sales to be affected by competing app stores in Europe.

""The ultimate impact will be minimal as most consumers are creatures of habit and are very satisfied with the platform,"" he said. ""We expect a majority of consumers will keep the status quo by utilizing (Apple's) existing app store.""

Enforcement of the European Union's DMA is expected to begin in mid-2024. The law requires big tech companies to open their systems to competitors in hopes of increasing consumer choice. The big gatekeepers, as the law describes them, face fines of up to 10% of annual global revenue for violations.

The iPhone maker has said that allowing sideloading, bypassing its App Store, exposes users to security and privacy dangers. But some regulators and critics, such as ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games, have said those concerns are overblown.

Epic CEO Tim Sweeney tweeted Tuesday that U.S. Congress must pass proposed legislation similar to DMA, or it ""would leave American developers in serfdom.""

Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google has allowed sideloading on phones powered by its Android operating system for years. But to take advantage, users must adjust settings and swipe past security warnings, meaning 90% of downloads still come from Google's official app store, Epic has alleged in court.

391,META,2023-01-09,"Facebook, YouTube remove content backing Brazil attack","[1/2] Supporters of Brazil's former President Jair Bolsonaro demonstrate against President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, in Brasilia, Brazil, January 8, 2023. REUTERS/Adriano Machado















STOCKHOLM/LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Facebook parent Meta (META.O) and Google's (GOOGL.O) video platform YouTube said on Monday they were removing content supporting or praising the weekend ransacking of Brazilian government buildings by anti-democratic demonstrators.

Tens of thousands of supporters of Brazil's far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro smashed presidential palace windows, flooded parts of Congress with a sprinkler system and ransacked rooms in the Supreme Court in a more than three hour attack.

""In advance of the election, we designated Brazil as a temporary high-risk location and have been removing content calling for people to take up arms or forcibly invade Congress, the Presidential palace and other federal buildings,"" a Meta spokesman said.

""We are also designating this as a violating event, which means we will remove content that supports or praises these actions,"" he said. ""We are actively following the situation and will continue removing content that violates our policies.""

Leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took office on Jan. 1 after defeating Bolsonaro in a runoff election in October, ending Brazil's most right-wing government in decades.

Bolsonaro refused to concede defeat and some supporters have claimed the election was stolen, with people taking to social media and messaging platforms from Twitter (TWTR.MX), Telegram and TikTok to YouTube and Facebook, to organise protests.

A spokesperson for YouTube told Reuters that the video-sharing company was ""closely tracking"" the situation in Brazil, where social media platforms have been ordered to block users accused of supporting the attack.

""Our Trust and Safety team is removing content that violates our Community Guidelines, including livestreams and videos inciting violence,"" the spokesperson said.

""In addition, our systems are prominently surfacing authoritative content on our homepage, at the top of search results, and in recommendations. We will remain vigilant as the situation continues to unfold.""

'PROACTIVE MONITORING'

A representative for Telegram said the private messaging app was working with Brazil's government and fact checking groups to prevent the spread of content inciting violence.

""Telegram is a platform that supports the right to free speech and peaceful protest. Calls to violence, however, are explicitly forbidden on our platform,"" a spokesperson said.

""Our moderators use a combination of proactive monitoring in public-facing parts of our platform in addition to accepting user reports, in order to remove such content.""

TikTok and Twitter did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Twitter's Brazil staff was severely cut in layoffs following Elon Musk's takeover in October, which included eight employees who oversaw trending topics and helped add context to tweets that had been labelled for misinformation, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Messages seen by Reuters throughout the week showed members of such groups organising meeting points in several cities around the country, from where chartered buses would leave for Brasilia, with the intention to occupy public buildings.

Social media companies were criticised for not doing enough when supporters of former U.S. President Donald Trump invaded the U.S. Capitol two years ago. Platforms like Facebook and Alphabet's YouTube have said they are working to remove misleading information about elections and voting.

392,META,2022-10-20,Instagram to make it easier to avoid trolls,"













Oct 20 (Reuters) - Instagram will enhance features that help users block the accounts of abusers and trolls on the social media platform, the Meta Platforms-owned (META.O) company said on Thursday.

Users will now be able to block all existing accounts of a person, expanding a feature launched last year that only allowed the blocking of any new accounts that they may create.

""Based on initial test results from this new change, we expect our community will need to block 4 million fewer accounts every week, since these accounts will now be blocked automatically,"" Instagram said in a blog post.

The photo-sharing app has been doubling down on tackling hate speech and online abuse on its platform, which is more popular among teens and young adults than Meta's Facebook.

Instagram has also upgraded its feature that helps prevent users from viewing possibly abusive messages, by filtering offensive words to story replies, and said on Thursday it is expanding ""nudges"" designed to protect creators from harassment.

Nov 30 (Reuters) - Silicon Valley leaders welcomed Elon Musk's management of Twitter, with Netflix (NFLX.O) co-founder Reed Hastings going so far as to call the billionaire ""the bravest, most creative person on the planet.""

Meta Platforms (META.O) CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday said he was keen to see how Elon Musk's management of content moderation on Twitter would fare, arguing it was good for platforms to take different approaches.

""You can agree or disagree with what Elon is doing, or how he's doing it, but I do think it's going to be very interesting to see how this plays out,"" said Zuckerberg, speaking at the New York Times DealBook conference.

""I would guess that not everything is going to work, but I think some things might work,"" he said.

Hastings said Musk has a different management style than his own but added: ""I'm 100% convinced he's trying to help the world with all of his endeavors.""

The Netflix co-founder said Musk believes in free speech and its role in democracy.

""It's not how I would do it, but I'm deeply respectful,"" said Hastings. ""I'm amazed that people are so nitpicky.""

394,META,2022-08-31,"Snap to cut 20% of staff, cancel projects in cost-cutting effort","













Aug 31 (Reuters) - Snap Inc (SNAP.N) said on Wednesday it will lay off 20% of all staff and shut down projects, including mobile games and novelties like a flying drone camera, as high inflation and a deteriorating economy ravage the advertising industry.

The cuts will help the company save an estimated $500 million in costs annually, Snap said.

Snap shares rose 15% in morning trading, which reverberated across the sector. Shares in Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) were up 5% and Pinterest Inc (PINS.N) rose 6%.

The company said it will focus on improving sales and the number of Snapchat users.

The ""clear and defining action"" to refocus its business has reassured investors, said Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight.

Analysts and investors have viewed Snap as an early indicator for trends affecting other social media platforms, as Snap is usually first to report quarterly earnings or provide business updates.

Snap's warning in May that it would miss its revenue targets due to worsening economic conditions sparked a sell-off in social media stocks. read more

Shares in Santa Monica, California-based Snap closed down 2.5% at $10 on Tuesday after The Verge first reported Snap's plans for layoffs, and AdAge reported the departure of two top advertising executives.

Revenue growth so far in the third quarter is up 8% from the previous year, which is ""well below what we were expecting"", Chief Executive Evan Spiegel wrote in a memo to employees that was also released publicly on Wednesday.

If that growth rate holds, it would be the slowest revenue growth Snap has had since becoming a public company in 2017 - a far cry from triple-digit growth rates it has recorded in previous quarters.

Two of Snap's top ad sales executives - Chief Business Officer Jeremi Gorman and Vice President of ad sales Peter Naylor - are leaving to join Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and build the streaming service's ad business. read more

Gorman, a longtime advertising executive who previously worked at Amazon, was instrumental in building Snap's ad business, said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at research firm Insider Intelligence.

Gorman and Naylor's departures come after Snap reported a disappointing second quarter, and it is facing more competition from TikTok, she said.

""Snap is clearly going through a tough time,"" Enberg said.

'FACE THE CONSEQUENCES'

Despite reducing spending in some areas, Snap must now ""face the consequences of our lower revenue growth and adapt to the market environment"", CEO Spiegel wrote in the memo.

Senior vice president of engineering Jerry Hunter will be promoted to chief operating officer and will be responsible for improving coordination between engineering, ad sales and product teams, Spiegel said.

Snap and other social media platforms including Meta have all suffered from privacy updates that Apple Inc (AAPL.O) introduced on iPhones last year.

These have made it difficult for digital ad sellers and advertisers to target ads to relevant audiences and measure their sales results.

Closer collaboration between engineering and sales could potentially help Snap improve targeting and measurement of its ads.

The restructuring of the ad sales division also includes three new president roles that will oversee the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Asia-Pacific regions.

Snap will also discontinue investment in its Pixy flying drone camera, just a few months after its debut in May.

395,META,2023-01-05,WhatsApp announces new proxy support feature to bypass internet shutdowns,"













Jan 5 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) WhatsApp said on Thursday users of the messaging app will now be able to use proxy servers to access the service in countries where the app is blocked.

A proxy server is an intermediary between users and web services and acts as a web filter that allow netizens to circumvent restrictions and censorship.

WhatsApp said proxy support on the app is now officially available for users with the latest version.

Users in countries such as Iran and Syria have used virtual private network (VPN) services to navigate around internet censorship.

The messaging service said, ""in case these shutdowns continue, we hope this solution helps people wherever there is a need for secure and reliable communication.""

WhatsApp ""will do anything"" within its technical capacity to keep the service accessible and that it was not blocking Iranian phone numbers, the messaging service had said in September.

Iran restricted access to Meta's Instagram and WhatsApp after unrest broke out in response to the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was arrested by morality police in Tehran for ""unsuitable attire"".

BENGALURU, Sept 2 (Reuters) - WhatsApp banned 2.39 million Indian accounts in July, the highest so far this year, the Meta (META.O)-owned popular instant messaging app said late on Thursday in its monthly report.

The Asian nation's stricter IT laws have made it necessary for large digital platforms to publish compliance reports every month.

Draft rules circulated in June (https://bit.ly/3KIrfuM) proposed setting up a panel to hear user appeals, and said that significant social media messaging platforms shall allow identification of the first originator of information if directed by courts to do so.

Of the accounts barred, 1.42 million were ""proactively banned,"" before any reports from users. (https://bit.ly/3wPqRoW)

Several accounts were banned based on complaints received through the company's grievances channel and the tools and resources it uses to detect such offenses, the social media platform said. In July, WhatsApp received a total of 574 grievance reports.

The messsaging platform, which has been criticised earlier for spreading fake news and hate speech in the country, as well as elsewhere in the world, had taken down 2.21 million accounts in India in June.

397,META,2022-04-20,YouTube blocks account of Hong Kong's sole leadership candidate,"Summary

Summary Companies Campaign channel removed to comply with U.S. sanctions

Lee is sole candidate for Hong Kong's leadership

Former security official is under US sanctions

Has Beijing's backing















HONG KONG, April 20 (Reuters) - YouTube blocked the account of Hong Kong's sole leadership candidate John Lee on Wednesday because of U.S. sanctions against him, while Facebook owner Meta said he could keep his account but not use payment services.

The move, which has no bearing on his chances of winning office, follows the imposition of U.S. sanctions on Lee and other Hong Kong and Chinese officials in 2020 over what Washington said was their role in curbing the city’s freedoms under a national security law Beijing imposed in June that year.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), which owns YouTube, said it had taken down Lee's campaign account to comply with U.S. sanction laws as Hong Kong's former security chief and No. 2 official prepares for a leadership election on May 8.

""Google complies with applicable U.S. sanctions laws and enforces related policies under its terms of service. After review and consistent with these policies, we terminated the Johnlee2022 YouTube channel,"" the company said in an email response to Reuters.

Separately, Facebook owner Meta Platforms (FB.O) said that while Lee can keep ""demonetized presences"" on Facebook and Instagram, it had taken steps to prevent use of payments services. Lee's Facebook page was still visible on Wednesday.

'BULLYING'

Lee, a former deputy police commissioner, said the block would not affect his unchallenged campaign bid to lead Hong Kong for the next five years.

""Those so-called sanctions on me are unreasonable, are bullying, are intentionally pressuring, trying to force me to be hesitant. But as I’ve repeatedly stressed, this unreasonable behaviour will only make me convinced that I’m doing the right thing,"" Lee told a media briefing.

""With regards to some (social) media (platforms) which I will have no access to, I feel disappointed but this will not affect my election effort.""

While the internet in mainland China is heavily censored and access to foreign social media platforms and many news sites is blocked, Hong Kong enjoys greater freedoms under the ""one country, two systems"" framework agreed when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.

Critics of the Hong Kong government say those freedoms are being eroded by Beijing, which authorities deny.

Lee, who has Beijing's backing,aims to replace Chief Executive Carrie Lam who will step down on June 30 after governing the city through a period of unprecedented anti-government protests and COVID-19.

He is expected to announce his policy platform this month, media reports said.

Lee has picked nearly 150 heavyweights, including the city's richest man, Li Ka-shing, and other powerful businessmen and politicians, to join his advisory team in a bid to show broad support for his candidacy.

A former career police officer, Lee is expected to prioritise security issues if he gets the top job, having previously urged new legislation to fully implement the sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing.

Authorities in Hong Kong and China say that law was needed to restore stability after widespread anti-government protests in 2019.

Since Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997, it has had four chief executives, all of whom have struggled to balance the democratic aspirations of some residents with the vision of China's Communist leaders.

All four leaders have been backed by China and were chosen by an ""election committee"" stacked with Beijing loyalists.

398,META,2023-01-19,Davos 2023: What you need to know about the WEF on Thursday,"













DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 19 (Reuters) - All eyes were on Greta Thunberg on Thursday as she called on the global energy industry and its financiers to end all fossil fuel investments at a high-profile meeting in Davos with Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA).

During the round-table, she and three of her fellow activists said they had presented a ""cease and desist"" letter to CEOs calling for a stop to new oil, gas and coal extraction.

""As long as they can get away with it they will continue to invest in fossil fuels, they will continue to throw people under the bus,"" Thunberg warned.

That message seemed to have got through to Britain's opposition leader Keir Starmer, who said there would be no investment in new oil and gas fields in Britain if the Labour arty is elected to govern, which would mark a big change from the country's current energy policies.

""What we've said about oil and gas is that there does need to be a transition,"" he said.

While much of the talk at and around the annual World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting has been about the urgent need to address climate change and the challenges and solutions of the transition to a low-carbon economy, war in Ukraine has also been at or near the top of the agenda.

As Kyiv attempts to secure more modern arms from its allies, it has stepped up a parallel effort to lock in financial support from business leaders in Davos to help rebuild the country.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine last year, the United States and its allies have given tens of billions of dollars' worth of weaponry, but Kyiv is still desperate for more, and keen to ride a wave of Western public support to ensure that pledges for its reconstruction are more than just words.

Ukraine, which dominated the WEFs last big meeting in May, has again sent dozens of executives, lawmakers and decision makers with a clear message from President Volodymyr Zelenskiy: commit now, not later.

Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson lent his support, urging allies to double down on sending military equipment to support Ukraine.

""The best thing for the world is to get this thing done, and done fast,"" Johnson said in an interview as part of the Reuters Impact Arctic Warning series.

ChatGPT has also been a hot topic of conversation.

Generative artificial intelligence, the umbrella technology behind the popular chatbot technology, has interesting applications for social media, Chris Cox, the chief product officer for Facebook parent Meta, told Reuters.

He said that such technology has the capability to create image filters for apps like Instagram. Meta has been working on generative AI research, for instance tech that can convert a text prompt into a video clip.

399,META,2022-06-24,U.S. tech industry frets about handing data to states prosecuting abortion,"













PALO ALTO, Calif., June 24 (Reuters) - The technology industry is bracing for the uncomfortable possibility of having to hand over pregnancy-related data to law enforcement, in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision on Friday to overturn the Roe v. Wade precedent that for decades guaranteed a woman's constitutional right to an abortion. read more

As state laws limiting abortion kick in after the ruling, technology trade representatives told Reuters they fear police will obtain warrants for customers' search history, geolocation and other information indicating plans to terminate a pregnancy. Prosecutors could access the same via a subpoena, too.

The concern reflects how the data collection practices of companies like Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) have the potential to incriminate abortion-seekers for state laws that many in Silicon Valley oppose.

""It is very likely that there’s going to be requests made to those tech companies for information related to search histories, to websites visited,"" said Cynthia Conti-Cook, a technology fellow at the Ford Foundation.

Google declined to comment. Representatives for Amazon and Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Technology has long gathered - and at times revealed - sensitive pregnancy-related information about consumers. In 2015, abortion opponents targeted ads saying ""Pregnancy Help"" and ""You Have Choices"" to individuals entering reproductive health clinics, using so-called geofencing technology to identify smartphones in the area.

More recently, Mississippi prosecutors charged a mother with second-degree murder after her smartphone showed she had searched for abortion medication in her third trimester, local media reported. Conti-Cook said, ""I can’t even imagine the depth of information that my phone has on my life.""

While suspects unwittingly can hand over their phones and volunteer information used to prosecute them, investigators may well turn to tech companies in the absence of strong leads or evidence. In United States v. Chatrie, for example, police obtained a warrant for Google location data that led them to Okello Chatrie in an investigation of a 2019 bank robbery.

Amazon, for instance, complied at least partially with 75% of search warrants, subpoenas and other court orders demanding data on U.S. customers, the company disclosed for the three years ending in June 2020. It complied fully with 38%. Amazon has said it must comply with ""valid and binding orders,"" but its goal is to provide ""the minimum"" that the law requires.

Eva Galperin, cybersecurity director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said on Twitter on Friday, ""The difference between now and the last time that abortion was illegal in the United States is that we live in an era of unprecedented digital surveillance.""

400,META,2022-12-04,"New Zealand plans law to require Facebook, Google to pay for news","













WELLINGTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The New Zealand government said it will introduce a law that will require big online digital companies such as Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) to pay New Zealand media companies for the local news content that appears on their feeds.

Minister of Broadcasting Willie Jackson said in a statement on Sunday that the legislation will be modelled on similar laws in Australia and Canada and he hoped it would act as an incentive for the digital platforms to reach deals with local news outlets.

""New Zealand news media, particularly small regional and community newspapers, are struggling to remain financially viable as more advertising moves online,"" Jackson said. ""It is critical that those benefiting from their news content actually pay for it.""

The new legislation will go to a vote in parliament where the governing Labour Party's majority is expected to pass it.

Australia introduced a law in 2021 that gave the government power to make internet companies negotiate content supply deals with media outlets. A review released by the Australian government last week found it largely worked.

WASHINGTON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers on Monday released a revised version of a bill aimed at making it easier for news organizations to negotiate collectively with platforms like Google and Facebook.

The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act ""removes legal obstacles to news organizations' ability to negotiate collectively and secure fair terms from gatekeeper platforms that regularly access news content without paying for its value,"" according to a news release from the lawmakers.

The group includes Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar and Republican Senator John Kennedy, both members of the Judiciary Committee, and House Judiciary Committee members David Cicilline, a Democrat, and Ken Buck, a Republican.

A previous version of the bill, introduced in March 2021, was opposed by two technology industry trade groups that Meta Platforms' (META.O) Facebook, and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google belong to - the Computer & Communications Industry Association and NetChoice.

The updated bill would cover news publishers with fewer than 1,500 full-time employees and non-network news broadcasters. It would allow them to work together to win better deals from Facebook, Google and other large platforms, according to the news release.

The 2021 legislation would have applied to any print, broadcast or digital news organization with a dedicated editorial staff that published at least on a weekly basis.

Oct 19 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) laid off under 1,000 employees across several divisions this week, Axios reported on Tuesday, citing a source, making it the latest U.S. technology company to cut jobs or slow hiring amid a global economic slowdown.

The layoffs affected less than 1% of Microsoft's total workforce of around 221,000 as of June 30.

""Like all companies, we evaluate our business priorities regularly and make structural adjustments accordingly. We will continue to invest in our business and hire in key growth areas in the year ahead,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said.

The company had said in July that a small number of roles had been eliminated and that it would increase its headcount down the line.

Several technology companies, including Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), and Snap Inc (SNAP.N), have cut jobs and scaled back hiring in recent months as global economic growth slows due to higher interest rates, rising inflation and an energy crisis in Europe.

July 22 (Reuters) - Grocery delivery app Instacart said on Friday founder Apoorva Mehta would step down from his role as chairman and leave the company once it goes public.

Chief Executive Fidji Simo, the former head of Meta Inc's (META.O) Facebook app, will succeed Mehta. She joined Instacart as CEO in August 2021 after Mehta transitioned to executive chairman. read more

Mehta said in a Twitter post that stepping down from the company's board would allow him to pursue other opportunities. (https://bit.ly/3aUeaBv)

However, there will be no change in his ownership in the company, a source close to Instacart told Reuters.

Instacart in May said it had confidentially filed with the U.S. securities regulator to go public. Reuters had reported that the company was considering going public through either a direct listing or a traditional IPO. read more

In March, the San Francisco-based firm slashed its valuation by nearly 40% to about $24 billion, following market turbulence that impacted leading technology companies. read more

Sept 30 (Reuters) - Power tools maker Stanley Black & Decker (SWK.N) has cut 1,000 finance roles this week in an effort to trim costs, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday citing people familiar with the matter.

The move comes at a time when several technology companies, crypto exchanges and financial firms are cutting jobs and freezing hirings as global economic growth slows due to higher interest rates, red-hot inflation and an energy crisis in Europe. read more

Jan 25 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google said on Wednesday it believes the complaint from the U.S. Department of Justice accusing the company of abusing its dominance in digital advertising is ""without merit"".

The company also added it will ""defend itself vigorously"".

The government on Tuesday said Google should be forced to sell its ad manager suite, tackling a business that generated about 12% of Google's revenue in 2021 while also playing a vital role in the search engine and cloud company's overall sales.

Google, which depends on its advertising business for about 80% of its revenue, said the government was ""doubling down on a flawed argument that would slow innovation, raise advertising fees and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow.""

The federal government has said its Big Tech investigations and lawsuits are aimed at leveling the playing field for smaller rivals who are up against a group of powerful companies that include Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (META.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

""In contrast with prior cases/investigations against Google's ad tech biz, we view the DOJ complaint as fairly substantive and preempting some potential Google lines of defense,"" said Wells Fargo analyst Brian Fitzgerald.

406,META,2022-05-09,Toronto can teach aspiring tech hubs some lessons,"













TORONTO, May 9 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Toronto has some lessons for would-be technology hubs. Favorable immigration rules and cheaper labor costs are among the factors that lured Silicon Valley tech behemoths to the Canadian city. Search engine Google (GOOGL.O) has doubled its employee base in Canada to more than 3,000 full-time staff in two years, while Facebook owner Meta Platforms (FB.O)announced in March it was creating a Toronto engineering hub and up to 2,500 jobs in the country over several years. While some advantages might fade, that may not matter for now.

Canada’s most populous city lacks the balmy climate of rival tech wannabes like Austin or Singapore, but boasts advantages like looser immigration policies. While Trump-era restrictions made it harder for U.S. companies to hire foreign employees, Canada is more welcoming. Immigrants made up nearly 38% of the country’s tech workers in 2016, according to a study by Brookfield Institute.

Toronto’s proximity to New York and access to public healthcare are added bonuses, while the government promotes technology through tax incentives for research and development. Toronto benefits from a “brain gain” of incoming workers: it added nearly 55,000 more tech talent jobs than it produced graduates, according to a 2021 study by CBRE. The city's modest wages, which are just 65% of the U.S. average according to CBRE, also appeal to employers.

These factors trump features often touted by prospective tech hubs, like plentiful supplies of capital. With a market capitalization of roughly C$4 trillion ($3 trillion) as of the end of March, the Toronto Stock Exchange is dwarfed by bourses south of the border. And while the amount invested in Canadian startups reached almost $14 billion last year according to PitchBook data, more than double the 2019 high, it’s a fraction of what venture capitalists put to work elsewhere. Though Toronto has spawned unicorns like fintech firm WealthSimple and password management company 1Password, it lacks a broad base of homegrown tech firms.

Some of Toronto’s advantages could erode over time. Housing is getting costlier: The city ranked as the fourth least-affordable market of 30 North American metropolitan areas, according to a January analysis by Oxford Economics. The tech influx may push up wages. For now, though, Toronto remains attractive. Collision, an upcoming tech conference held in the city in June, has attracted over 33,000 attendees and more than 1,250 startups. Other aspiring tech hubs should take note.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Toronto-based password management company 1Password said on Jan 19 that it had closed a $620 million funding round, bringing the company’s valuation to $6.8 billion. Financial technology startup Wealthsimple said in May 2021 that it had raised a C$750 million ($585 million) financing round at a post-money valuation of C$5 billion.

- Meta Platforms said on March 29 that it was creating a new engineering hub in Toronto with plans to create up to 2,500 new jobs in Canada over the next several years. It also announced an additional C$510,000 in unrestricted grants to 17 Canadian research labs working on research related to the metaverse.

- Venture capital investment in Canadian startups was close to $14 billion in 2021, more than double the previous high of $5.8 billion in 2019, according to PitchBook data.

407,META,2022-09-12,Big Tech has its moment to take on Lina Khan,"













NEW YORK, Sept 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - A litigation setback for Federal Trade Commission trustbusters shows the thin legal ice on which antitrust hardliners like agency boss Lina Khan tread. Procedural hurdles to dealmaking introduced under her tenure appropriately discourage some mergers. But technology giants with the resources to wage court battles have an opening, now with extra legal precedent, to push back.

An agency-appointed judge's ruling in favor of medical technology companies Illumina (ILMN.O) and Grail (GRAL.O) marks the FTC’s first major loss under Khan. The FTC sued to unwind their $7 billion merger shortly before she was appointed chair in 2021, part of a clampdown on consolidation under the Biden administration that ramped up after she took over.

Under Khan, the FTC expanded deal investigations, stopped putting uncontroversial approvals on a fast-track, and expanded its reach by selectively screening future transactions outside of the normal process read more . These hurdles increase the cost of deals, so transactions without a compelling case no longer make sense. Meanwhile, deals raising bipartisan antitrust bugbears are more verboten than ever.

Yet U.S. dealmaking totaled $2.6 trillion in 2021, per Refinitiv – a record. Big tech firms are buying into adjacent markets: Microsoft (MSFT.O) agreed to buy Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) for $69 billion; Amazon.com (AMZN.O) acquired MGM for $8.5 billion. So Khan is rewriting the antitrust playbook to target tech deals that are harder to block under traditional rubric read more .

The problem, as the FTC found out in court, is convincing judges of these novel theories if buyers litigate. Despite launching its lawsuit on a bipartisan vote, the FTC’s case stretched the bounds of normal antitrust arguments. Khan’s next targets – like a recent lawsuit against Meta Platform’s (META.O) acquisition of virtual reality app developer Within – push even further, implying an even tougher battle.

Seeing this potential weakness, buyers looking to buck a crackdown have reason to stand their ground in court – as Meta is doing. And as the stakes increase, the possibility that a lawsuit will spiral into appeals, possibly all the way to the Supreme Court, rises.

If that happens, fundamental questions of antitrust practice that have largely been uncontested, like the FTC’s analytical methods, could be challenged. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, part of the court’s conservative majority, has expressed antitrust skepticism. Khan says there are benefits to fighting cases the agency might lose. But if courts establish legal precedent limiting the agency’s power, both she and her successors will bear that burden for years to come.

BENGALURU, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Food delivery platform Swiggy is planning to lay off 380 jobs, citing challenging macroeconomic conditions, according to an internal mail seen by Reuters on Friday, and joined a list of Indian startups that are shedding their workforce.

""The growth rate for food delivery has slowed down versus our projections (along with many peer companies globally. This meant that we needed to revisit our overall indirect costs to hit our profitability goals,"" Swiggy Chief Executive Officer and founder Harsha Majety told staff in the mail.

""We needed to right-size our overall personnel costs, also in line with the projections for the future. Our overhiring is a case of poor judgement,"" the mail added.

The food delivery startup, which has an employee strength of 6,000, operates in more than 500 cities.

Fears of an economic downturn prompted startups to slash thousands of jobs in recent months. Edtech startup Byju's, ride-hailing app Ola and video platform ShareChat also announced job cuts over the past six months.

Funding rounds backed by venture capital firms have also slowed down compared with a blockbuster 2021, according to Venture Intelligence.

Earlier this week, technology giants Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) said they would lay off 10,000 and 18,000 employees, respectively, while Meta announced its decision to cut 11,000 jobs.

BOGOTA, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Energy companies operating in Colombia, including majority state-owned oil company Ecopetrol, on Monday raised concerns about a roadblock in the country's Meta province, which led to prodcution cuts of more than 49,500 barrels of oil per day.

The roadblock is impeding movement on the road between Puerto Gaitan and Rubiales, preventing fuel from reaching oil operations, companies said in a joint statement sent to journalists by Ecopetrol and private operators' group the Colombian Petroleum Association (ACP).

More than 5,332 oil workers and their families have been negatively impacted by the protest, which has continued for seven days, the statement said.

""The social and economic impacts are enormous,"" the statement said, citing the impact on oil production as well as delays moving food and other good.

Signatories included Ecopetrol's subsidiary Hocol, as well as Spanish oil company Cepsa (CPF.GQ) and Canadian producer Frontera Energy.

The protests are also impacting operations at refineries in the cities of Cartagena and Barrancabermeja, the companies said, putting Colombia's fuel supplies at risk.

The energy ministry and the national police did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In late January Ecopetrol said it would reduce output at its Barrancabermeja refinery to 210,000 bpd, from 230,000 bpd, because of farmer protests in Magdalena Medio.

410,META,2022-10-13,Big Tech's hiring freeze unlocks rich talent pool for U.S. startups,"













Oct 13 (Reuters) - Late-stage U.S. startups are scooping up talent unlocked by layoffs and hiring freezes at Big Tech, adding experienced engineers and project managers to their roster despite signs of an economic slowdown.

Companies, with steady cash flow from viable products in the market, are offering rich pay checks to lure talent that would have otherwise preferred working at big technology firms including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Facebook-parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O).

Stack Overflow Chief Executive Prashanth Chandrasekar said the coding platform's headcount had more than doubled this year to 540, with some of the new hires being tapped from firms such as Alphabet Inc-owned (GOOGL.O) Google and Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

""When competitors downsize, other talented people who are employed there may consider looking elsewhere, as they may not see their company as being stable,"" Chandrasekar said.

Deepak Rao, CEO of X1 Card, said the credit-card startup's headcount had more than doubled to 35 in a year and more employees from larger companies would join it in the coming months.

Google, Apple, Microsoft and Meta and did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The hiring spree comes even as startup funding is drying up in the face of decades-high inflation, a stronger dollar and massive rate hikes, which have pushed Big Tech to pull back on their spending spree.

Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics

According to GlobalData, venture capital funding raised by U.S. startups fell by nearly a third to $146.3 billion in the first eight months of 2022.

""Tech startups reliant on ongoing VC funding have cut back on hiring, but companies in the later funding stages with viable products in the market are faring much better,"" said Patrick McAdams, CEO of recruiting firm Andiamo.

""These companies have continued to hire strategically and are now able to take advantage of a softening tech hiring market to make key hires that were nearly impossible this time last year (when the pandemic drove up demand for tech workers).""

A survey of 581 executives, almost entirely from U.S. tech startups, showed that more than 40% of them boosted their hiring plans in the first half of 2022, according to hiring firm A.Team and startup consultant MassChallenge.

Companies are also shortening hiring times and offering higher pay packages to lock in candidates as they compete for talent in a tight labor market, recruiters said.

A greater say in decision making provided by startups has also appealed to executives such as Mansoor Basha, who joined Stagwell (STGW.O), a $2.2 billion marketing firm, as technology chief in September from Accenture .

""An opportunity to make key decisions internally was important for me,"" he said.

Still, some analysts warn there is only so long until startups can continue the hiring pace amid a weak economic backdrop.

""If the economy does indeed go into recession, it will only add to the pressure faced by tech firms as demand dries up,"" says Dante DeAntonio, director of economics research at Moody's Analytics.

Sept 9 (Reuters) - Online gaming firm Roblox Corp (RBLX.N) said on Friday it plans to launch 3D advertising on its platform next year, as it strives to diversify its revenue stream beyond in-game purchases.

It will test ads with developers and a handful of advertisers by the end of this year, Roblox said at its annual developers conference.

The 3D advertising, better known as ""immersive ads"", experience will only reach audiences aged 13 and above, Roblox said.

The announcement, however, comes at a time when a deteriorating economy continues to ravage the advertising industry, including giants such as Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O).

California-based Roblox, famous for its games ""Jailbreak"" and ""MeepCity"", has felt the pinch as reopening of schools after the lockdown and the red-hot inflation crimped user spending. read more

To combat the cooling demand, Roblox has been doubling down on the ""metaverse"", a virtual space where players can do everything from hanging out and chatting to shopping and attending concerts.

Currently, it generates most of its revenue from its virtual currency ""Robux"", which kids use to upgrade players' avatars by buying in-game items such as accessories or pets.

Jan 31 (Reuters) - Snap Inc (SNAP.N) on Tuesday said current quarter revenue could decline by as much as 10%, sending its shares down 14% as the company struggles with weak advertising demand.

The owner of photo messaging app Snapchat is the first of the major digital advertising platforms to report fourth-quarter results, which provides an early clue for platforms like Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O) when they report results later this week.

Meta shares fell 2% and Alphabet dropped 1%. Pinterest (PINS.N) dropped 5%.

In a letter to investors, Snap said a weakening economy, increased competition from other social media platforms and ""platform policy changes"" continued to hurt its business in the fourth quarter.

Apple began rolling out privacy changes on iPhones in 2021 that have limited advertisers' ability to collect data for targeted advertising.

Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said during a conference call with analysts that the company is working to improve its ability to measure and boost the effectiveness of its ads, but it would take time for the investments to translate into higher revenue.

HEADWINDS PERSIST

""We expect the headwinds we have faced over the past year to persist throughout Q1,"" the company said in a letter to investors.

Revenue for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 was $1.3 billion, flat from the prior-year and in line with analyst expectations.

Snap's net loss was $288 million during the quarter, versus net income of $23 million the previous year. It reported adjusted earnings per share of 14 cents, beating Wall Street estimates of 11 cents.

Snap will host an investor day on Feb. 16 to detail its plan to move forward after announcing in August that it would lay off 20% of its staff and discontinue experimental projects like a drone camera to cut costs.

The tech sector has been hammered in recent months amid record-high inflation and expectations of a recession.

Shares of the Santa Monica, California-based company are down 65% over the past year.

It said it now has more than 2 million subscribers to its premium product Snapchat+, which Snap launched last year in an effort to develop a new revenue source.

Spiegel said Tuesday he was ""very excited about the opportunity around generative (artificial intelligence),"" which could help advance Snap's investments in augmented reality, or technology that overlays computerized images onto the real world.

Generative AI is a technology that generates text or images in response to a prompt, and has taken the tech industry by storm in recent months.

Daily active users on Snapchat rose 17% year-over-year to 375 million, beating analyst expectations of 374 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

In its letter to investors, the company said its internal forecast assumes a 2% to 10% revenue decline in the first quarter compared to a year ago, and said revenue is currently down 7% so far in the quarter.

Snap forecast daily active users in the first quarter between 382 million and 384 million.

415,META,2023-01-23,Spotify to cut staff as soon as this week - Bloomberg News,"













Jan 22 (Reuters) - Spotify Technology (SPOT.N) is planning layoffs as soon as this week to cut costs, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday, joining the likes of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) who have cut thousands of jobs recently.

The report, which cited sources, said that the number of jobs being eliminated was not specified.

Spotify did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.

Tech firms shed jobs last year as a demand boom during the pandemic rapidly fizzled, and layoffs have continued this year with companies looking to rein in costs to ride out the economic downturn.

In the last few weeks, Google parent Alphabet said it would eliminate 12,000 jobs, while Microsoft said it would eliminate 10,000. Amazon's layoff round will impact more than 18,000 roles.

Other tech companies like Facebook-parent Meta and Elon Musk's Twitter laid off thousands late last year.

416,META,2023-03-07,TikTok to allow creators to sell collections of long-format videos,"













March 7 (Reuters) - Chinese short-video sharing app TikTok said on Tuesday it will allow some creators to produce collections of longer videos and charge their audience a premium for access, opening up a new channel of monetization for its users.

Its new offering ""Series"" will allow eligible creators to put collections of up to 80 videos, each about 20 minutes long behind a paywall. Currently, the allowed length of a video on TikTok is up to 10 minutes.

TikTok, which has disrupted the social media space largely dominated by Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) Facebook and Instagram with its short-form videos and a sophisticated recommendation engine, is now taking a shot at YouTube (GOOGL.O).

TikTok said its users are increasingly coming to the platform for content like must-know spreadsheet shortcuts, workout routines and recipe guides, areas where YouTube still remains the dominant destination.

It is not clear whether TikTok will take a cut from the creators. The company already offers its creators the ability to receive tips and gifts, as well as manages a fund to incentivize them to grow their audience.

TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, hit 1 billion monthly active users in September 2021 and has not reported its user base since. In comparison, Facebook had nearly 3 billion monthly active users as of December 2022.

417,META,2022-03-28,U.S. Chamber sides with Facebook in antitrust appeal,"













WASHINGTON, March 28 (Reuters) - The powerful U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a brief on Monday, urging a D.C. appeals court to reject an appeal by a big group of U.S. states to revive their antitrust lawsuit against Meta Platform's (FB.O) Facebook.

The Chamber, along with the Computer and Communications Industry Association and Business Roundtable, argued that the district court judge hearing the case was right to toss it out because the states had waited too long to file their case.

Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia last July dismissed the states' lawsuit against Facebook, saying they delayed in challenging the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014 respectively.

Boasberg, who also dismissed a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, allowed the agency to refile its complaint but did not do so for the states. read more

The group, made up of 46 states, Guam and the District of Columbia, argued that Boasberg erred in ruling they had waited too long to file the lawsuit and asked an appeals court to reinstate the case. read more

The business organizations argued further that the states were wrong in arguing that Facebook broke the law with exclusionary conduct, in executing what the states called a ""buy-or-bury strategy."" The business groups' brief called this position ""dubious and dangerous.""

BRUSSELS, June 8 (Reuters) - Meta's (FB.O) WhatsApp has until July to show that a privacy policy update introduced in January complies with EU consumer law, the European Commission said on Wednesday, in a case prompted by complaints from consumer bodies across Europe.

The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) and the European Network of consumer authorities said WhatsApp had not explained the changes in plain and intelligible language in breach of EU consumer law. read more

National enforcers have the power to impose sanctions on companies found breaching consumer laws.

The Consumer Protection Cooperation Network, which is made up of national consumer watchdogs and backed by the EU executive, sent a letter to WhatsApp in January asking for clarifications on its updated privacy policy.

The regulators said a March reply from the company did not convince them, prompting them to send a second letter on Wednesday.

""WhatsApp must ensure that users understand what they are agreeing to and how their personal data is used for commercial purposes, in particular to offer services to commercial partners,"" the Commission's justice chief Didier Reynders said in a statement.

WhatsApp said it would respond to the letter in due course.

""Our 2021 update did not change our commitment to user privacy or the way we operate our service, including how we process, use or share data with anyone, including Meta,"" a spokesperson said.

July 22 (Reuters) - Russian-backed separatists in a breakaway region of eastern Ukraine have blocked access to the search engine Google (GOOGL.O), their leader said on Friday, citing what he calls ""disinformation"".

In a message posted on his Telegram channel, Denis Pushilin, head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), accused Google of promoting ""violence against all Russians"" and said that its ""handlers from the U.S. government"" were to blame.

""If Google stops pursuing its criminal policy and returns to the mainstream of law, morality and common sense, there will be no obstacles to its work,"" he said.

He did not provide evidence to support his assertions.

Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Since sending troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, Russia and its proxies in eastern Ukraine have accused Western companies of spreading anti-Russian propaganda and taking a one-sided stance on the conflict.

Russia banned Facebook and Instagram in March after a court found Facebook-owner Meta guilty of ""extremist activity"". Moscow had already curbed access to Facebook for restricting Russian media outlets' access to the platform. read more

420,META,2022-10-27,Breakingviews: Amazon gets irrationally swept up in tech angst,"













NEW YORK, Oct 27 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Amazon.com (AMZN.O) is caught in the crossfire. Following abysmal earnings from Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O) on Wednesday, the $1 trillion online retailer took a big hit after unveiling its own third-quarter results. A warning on the upcoming holiday season erased $200 billion from the company’s market value, despite strong performance in North American sales and the cloud business. When an industry’s investors recalibrate what’s important, however, even decent companies will suffer.

The colossus now run by Andy Jassy booked solid revenue growth in the three months ending Sept. 30, in large part thanks to Amazon Web Services and retail sales in the United States and neighboring countries. Revenue for the business that delivers goods in the mail jumped to $107 billion, a 13% increase from a year earlier. While international sales dipped, they surged by more than a fifth in North America. Meanwhile the data storage business grew 27% to $21 billion.

Retailing isn’t consistently profitable, though. Through the first nine months of this year, more than $8 billion in operating losses chewed up nearly half the operating profit generated by AWS. The bleak economic outlook, despite 2.6% quarterly U.S. GDP growth reported on Thursday, suggests that nervous consumers might deliver more pain. The Conference Board corporate research outfit is predicting a 96% likelihood of recession. Amazon said fourth-quarter operating income could be as low as zero along with net sales projections that fell below what analysts were expecting, according to estimates gathered by Refinitiv. Foreign exchange rates are partly to blame.

North American sales make up almost 60% of Amazon’s top line. A shrinking pie for selling electronics and books online doesn’t sound great even though the company’s ethos is one of focusing on the long-term without obsessing myopically over the latest bottom line. Unlike Meta, Amazon is a victim of wider trends, including angst over the technology sector. It hardly deserves to be punished equally.

Nevertheless, fund managers are moving the goal posts. After years of infatuation with growth, they are now poring over the bottom line. For Amazon, that means proving its retail business can ultimately become profitable. With worsening expectations for its biggest customer – American shoppers – the job will only get harder.

CONTEXT NEWS

Amazon.com shares fell more than 18% to about $90.50 apiece in after-hours trading on Oct. 27 after the company forecast net sales for the Christmas holiday quarter that fell short of what analysts were anticipating.

The company’s net sales in the third quarter ending Sept. 30 were $127.1 billion, lower than the $127.5 billion projected by analysts, according to estimates gathered by Refinitiv. Operating cash flow decreased 27% to $39.7 billion for the trailing 12 months from the previous year-long stretch.

Amazon Web Services, the data storage business, increased sales 28% from a year earlier to $20.5 billion, also short of Wall Street’s expectations.

For the fourth quarter, Amazon said it expects net sales to be between $140 billion and $148 billion, up 2% to 8% from the fourth quarter in 2021. Analysts were expecting more than $155 billion. The company also guided to operating income of between zero and $4 billion for the final three months of the year compared to $3.5 billion a year earlier.

421,META,2022-10-31,Axing the tweeps,"













NEW YORK, Oct 31 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elon Musk isn’t messing around. Twitter’s new owner said earlier this month that he would eliminate 75% of the social media company’s 7,500-person workforce once he took over. He already has shown several senior executives the door, including former Chief Executive Parag Agrawal, and the Washington Post reported on Monday he was starting with a quarter of the employee base. Writing up pink slips en masse will have a ripple effect across Silicon Valley.

Facebook parent Meta Platforms and others have said they would cut staff, but on a much smaller scale. Often companies use periods of slow growth as an opportunity to eliminate underperforming members of the workforce. Soon after, though, many try to upgrade in various positions, keeping the net impact relatively small.

If Twitter’s staff shrinks considerably and permanently, it is bound to give other technology bosses ideas. Even as valuations have fallen, salaries are at an all-time high, according to a September study from job search site Hired.com. Musk is about to change that orthodoxy. (By Lauren Silva Laughlin)

AMSTERDAM, Oct 11 (Reuters) - A group of European telecom regulators does not support the idea of having big tech firms such as Google and Netflix paying for telecommunications infrastructure, it said in initial findings published on Tuesday.

The findings by the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) come as the European Commission is debating whether internet platforms should be obliged to fund digital infrastructure such as 5G telecoms networks, given they make heavy use of it.

""BEREC has found no evidence that such (a direct compensation) method is justified given the current state of the market,"" the BEREC conclusions said.

The telecommunications industry has argued Google, Netflix, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple should pay for a ""fair share"" of telecom infrastructure as their services make up more than half of internet traffic.

However, digital rights groups fear that if the big tech firms fund infrastructure, they will also strike deals with telecom firms to give their own traffic preferential treatment, undermining the principle of net neutrality.

In a reaction to the BEREC findings, telecom lobby group ETNO - the European Telecommunications Network Operators, which represents Deutsche Telekom, Orange Group, Telefonica and others - rejected the BEREC findings as outdated and said it would submit new evidence to the Commission to support its position.

BEREC's findings said the internet had proved resilient to changing traffic patterns in the past and following ETNO's proposals ""could be of significant harm"".

EU industry chief Thierry Breton has said the European Union will review the matter early in 2023.

July 15 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc's (NFLX.O) streaming service was back up after facing a more than hour-and-a-half long disruption across all devices, the company said on Friday.

There were thousands of reports of an outage from countries including the United States, France and India on Downdetector, which collates status reports from a number of sources.

Netflix had more than 220 million subscribers as of March end.

Some users took to Twitter to express disappointment about the outage spoiling their Friday night plans to binge watch shows.

""Friday Night and @netflix is down! How's your Friday Night going?"", one user tweeted.

An outage at Amazon.com's (AMZN.O) cloud services unit had temporarily knocked out Netflix's services in December. The incident had also impacted Walt Disney's (DIS.N) Disney+, Robinhood , a wide range of apps and Amazon.com Inc's e-commerce website. read more

Separately, Block Inc's (SQ.N) Square was also facing issues, according to the outage-tracking website.

On Thursday, social media apps Twitter (TWTR.N) and Meta Platforms-owned (META.O) Instagram faced outages. The micro-blogging site encountered a near three-hour disruption of services. read more

424,META,2022-04-29,U.S. equity funds post a third weekly outflow,"













April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. equity funds witnessed a third weekly outflow in the week to April 27 as investors worried about slowing global growth and a more aggressive Federal Reserve.

According to Refinitiv Lipper data, U.S. investors exited equity funds worth a net $10.55 billion, which was a 34% lower weekly outflow, compared with the previous week.

Fund flows: US equities bonds and money market funds

However, better-than-estimated earnings results from some mega cap U.S. companies including Microsoft Corp , Visa Inc (V.N) and Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) eased some concerns and capped outflows. read more

U.S. large-cap equity funds drew their first weekly inflow in three weeks, worth $698 million, but mid- and small-cap focused funds posted $1.67 billion and $1.74 billion, respectively, in outflows.

U.S. growth funds faced massive outflows for a third consecutive week, amounting $5.13 billion, while value funds had about $2 billion worth of net outgo.

Fund flows: US growth and value funds

Fund flows: US equity sector funds

U.S. money market funds drew inflows of $43.11 billion in the biggest weekly net buying since March 2.

Meanwhile, U.S. bond funds saw outflows easing to a three-week low of $4.53 billion.

U.S. municipal bond funds had net selling of $3.08 billion and taxable bond funds had outflows of $1.09 billion.

U.S. short/intermediate investment-grade funds posted outflows for a 16th week, worth $3.14 billion, although general domestic taxable fixed income funds and loan participation funds attracted $1.15 billion and $0.59 billion, respectively, in net buying.

Inflation-protected funds saw first weekly outflow in nine weeks, worth $319 million.

NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - Results from the four largest U.S. companies by market value highlight a busy week of corporate earnings and could help determine whether the stock market can sustain its recent rally.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) are set to report after the market closes on Tuesday, with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) due on Thursday, in a week that will see reports from about 170 companies representing some 47% of the S&P 500's market value, according to Credit Suisse.

Those four companies, which have helped power gains for the benchmark S&P 500 for the past decade, account for nearly one-fifth of the weigh in the index.

What they forecast is ""pretty representative of how the economy is doing,"" said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco. ""If Microsoft comes in and says things are ok, if Google says things are ok, then that represents a significant weight in not just market cap but the overall economy.""

The heart of the second-quarter earnings period is overlapping with Wednesday's decision from the Federal Reserve on interest rates. The central bank is expected to hike by 75 basis points as it seeks to fight the worst inflation in 40 years. read more

With inflation surging and rate hikes weighing on risk sentiment this year, the S&P 500 is down about 17% in 2022, but has rebounded 7% since its closing low for the year in June.

""This week could be very critical to whether we can continue to recover or whether this is just some kind of bear market rally on the way back down towards lows,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at family investment office Cherry Lane Investments.

The S&P 500 was down 0.6% early Tuesday after retailer Walmart (WMT.N) slashed its profit forecast as rising prices for food and fuel prompted customers to cut back on discretionary purchases. read more

Investors' expectations for second-quarter results were downbeat heading into the period, given concerns about a potential recession as well as inflation raising costs for businesses and consumers.

With 107 S&P 500 companies reported so far, about 75% have posted earnings above analysts' expectations, according to Refinitiv IBES data as of Monday. However, that trails the 81% beat rate for the past four quarters.

Earnings are expected to have climbed 6.1% for the second quarter from the year-ago period, according to Refinitiv. Tech sector earnings are projected to rise 2.4%.

The four megacap companies plus Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O) -- which reports on Wednesday -- are projected in aggregate to increase revenues by 6.7% but see earnings fall by 14.4%, according to Credit Suisse strategists.

When Alphabet and Meta report, focus will be on advertising spending after Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Snapchat's owner Snap Inc (SNAP.N) last week signaled advertisers had tightened their purse strings in response to a darkening economic outlook. read more

Investors will be keen for insight on consumer demand from Apple, maker of iPhones and MacBooks, and online retail giant Amazon.

Microsoft has already warned of financial headwinds from currency effects from the strong dollar, a factor that is expected to loom over an array of companies this period. read more

Overall, investors will want to learn how these companies are ""navigating what has really become a difficult economic environment for them,"" marked by supply chain snags, rising costs and slowing demand, Meckler said.

""The megacaps have historically proven incredibly resilient,” Meckler said.

Jan 23 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) was in talks with about half a dozen media partners including Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) to develop virtual reality (VR) content for its mixed reality headset, Bloomberg News reported on Monday.

Developed with Sony Group Corp (6758.T), the headset will have two ultra-high-resolution displays to handle the VR aspects and a collection of external cameras to enable an augmented reality ""pass-through mode"", the report said.

It added that the tech giant was working to update its own Apple TV+ material to work with the headset.

Disney, Apple and Sony did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that Apple was planning to unveil its first mixed reality (MR) headset this year.

MR is one of three types of extended reality technologies often associated with the metaverse. An MR headset could allow the wearer to use a real world object to trigger a virtual world reaction.

The iPhone maker's MR headset is set to launch in this year's spring event and will cost around $3,000, according to the report.

That would be twice as much as Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) Quest Pro virtual and MR headset, which waslaunched late last year for $1,500.

Luxshare has taken over the AR development team in Shanghai, previously owned by Taiwan's Pegatron (4938.TW) that first helped Apple develop the device, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

Taiwan-based Foxconn (2317.TW) is also helping with the project, Nikkei said, and Apple has tapped two of its most important suppliers, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) and Sony (6758.T), to develop micro OLED displays for the device.

The iPhone maker, Luxshare Precision, Foxconn and Sony did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment, while TSMC declined to comment.

Apple's headset is set to cost around $3,000 and will be launched at this year's spring event, Bloomberg previously reported.

The company hopes to reduce the price for the second generation of the device, Nikkei said.

The device will compete with the likes of Meta Platforms' (META.O) Quest Pro virtual and mixed-reality headset launched late last year at $1,500.

""It was not easy saying no to Super bowl ads, stadium naming rights, large sponsor deals a few months ago, but we did. Today, we are hiring for 2000 open positions for #Binance,"" Zhao said in a tweet to his 6.4 million followers on the social media app.

Binance did not immediately respond to Reuters request for additional details on the new jobs.

The move by Binance comes amid extreme volatility in the cryptocurrency market as investors are dumping risky assets over fears that soaring inflation would force the U.S. Federal Reserve to aggressively raise interest rates and tip the economy into a recession.

Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc (COIN.O) said on Tuesday it would cut about 1,100 jobs, or 18% of its workforce, the latest company preparing to ride out a downturn in the cryptosphere.

March 27 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk is giving ""serious thought"" to building a new social media platform, the billionaire said in a tweet on Saturday.

Musk was responding to a Twitter user's question on whether he would consider building a social media platform consisting of an open source algorithm and one that would prioritize free speech, and where propaganda was minimal.

Musk, a prolific user of Twitter himself, has been critical of the social media platform and its policies of late. He has said the company is undermining democracy by failing to adhere to free speech principles.

His tweet comes a day after he put out a Twitter poll asking users if they believed Twitter adheres to the principle of free speech, to which over 70% voted ""no"".

""The consequences of this poll will be important. Please vote carefully,"" he said on Friday.

If Musk decides to go ahead with creating a new platform, he would be joining a growing portfolio of technology companies that are positioning themselves as champions of free speech and which hope to draw users who feel their views are suppressed on platforms such as Twitter (TWTR.N), Meta Platform's (FB.O) Facebook and Alphabet-owned (GOOGL.O) Google's YouTube. read more

BERLIN, May 5 (Reuters) - Europe's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, the architect of landmark rules to curb the power of U.S. tech giants, called on Thursday for a global approach towards Big Tech to prevent companies taking advantage of enforcement gaps.

Vestager, who has handed out billions of euros in fines to Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google and launched investigations into Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Meta Platform's (FB.O) Facebook, said there was global agreement on the issues raised by large digital platforms.

""This debate is no longer a hot topic amongst competition practitioners but it has strong political attention,"" she told a conference organised by the German Cartel Office.

Vestager urged antitrust watchdogs around the world to work together to tackle the issue.

""Close cooperation will be necessary because we will not be short of work and we will not be short of novel services or practices to look at,"" she said.

""It goes without saying that the more we, as an international competition community, are able to harmonise our approach, the less opportunity there will be for global tech giants to exploit enforcement gaps between our jurisdictions,"" Vestager said.

U.S. antitrust enforcers and some U.S. states are also investigating Google, Facebook and Apple. Big Tech is also under fire in South Korea, India and Australia.

431,META,2023-03-07,EU tells Elon Musk to hire more staff to moderate Twitter - FT,"













March 7 (Reuters) - The European Union told Elon Musk to hire more human moderators and fact-checkers to review posts on Twitter, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday, citing four people familiar with talks between Musk, Twitter executives and regulators in Brussels.

The demand complicates Musk's efforts to reorganize the loss-making business he acquired for $44 billion in October. He has slashed more than half of Twitter's 7,500 staff, including the entire trust and safety teams in some offices, while seeking cheaper methods to monitor tweets, the report said.

The massive layoffs have raised concerns if Twitter can comply with the EU's Digital Services Act that requires internet platforms to put specific measures in place against illegal content, before the law comes into full effect in early 2024.

Twitter has been leaning heavily on automation to moderate content, doing away with certain manual reviews. It does not employ fact checkers, unlike larger rival Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), which owns Facebook and Instagram, the report said.

European Union industry chief Thierry Breton on a video call in January warned Musk of ""huge work ahead"" for Twitter to apply transparent use policies, significantly reinforce content moderation and protect freedom of speech.

BRUSSELS, March 28 (Reuters) - A data transfer deal agreed by the European Union and the United States last week will likely end up in court just like the two previous pacts it replaces, EU tech chief Margrethe Vestager said on Monday.

The 27-nation bloc and the United States announced the preliminary data transfer deal on Friday, seeking to end the limbo in which thousands of companies found themselves after Europe's top court threw out the two previous pacts due to concerns about U.S. surveillance. read more

Thousands of companies had found themselves in a legal quagmire when transferring Europeans' personal data across the Atlantic for personnel management, online sales and other activities.

""My guess is here that it will be tested indeed in court, but I know how much they have worked for this to be solid, but of course it remains to be seen,"" Vestager told Reuters in an interview.

Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems, whose campaign about the risk of U.S. intelligence agencies obtaining Europeans' data in a long-running dispute with Meta (FB.O) led to the court vetoes, has said he was ready to challenge the new accord if it fails to comply with EU laws.

Under the provisional deal, the U.S. government committed to set up an independent redress mechanism that includes a data protection review court to adjudicate claims while U.S. intelligence agencies will adopt procedures to oversee new privacy and civil liberties standards.

A final deal could take months to be finalised.

433,META,2023-01-20,Google to delay portion of staff bonus,"













Jan 19 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google is deferring a portion of its employees' year-end bonuses as part of a transition to a new performance management system, the search engine giant said on Thursday.

The company will pay 80% advance bonus to eligible employees initially and the remainder in later months, a spokesperson told Reuters, adding that the move was communicated to staff last year.

The development comes amid tech companies' attempts to limit spending amid a broader slowdown in demand and deteriorating economic conditions.

Alphabet has so far announced cuts impacting over 200 employees in its health sciences division even as its megacap peers Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) have let go thousands of employees.

The advance bonus will be paid in January and the remaining 20% in March or April, according to CNBC, which first reported the story. All bonuses next year onwards will be paid in March, the report added.

Google typically paid full bonuses in the first month of the year.

434,META,2023-02-16,Tencent says is making personnel adjustments after report of layoffs,"













HONG KONG, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) said on Thursday it was making some personnel adjustments after a media report said that the Chinese tech company was laying off staff in its recently formed ""extended reality"" (XR) business.

Chinese tech outlet 36Kr reported on Thursday, citing unnamed sources, that Tencent had notified the unit's more than 300 staff that they would be given two months to find new internal or external opportunities and that the unit would be disbanded.

Tencent, Asia's biggest internet company, told Reuters that it was untrue that it planned to disband the business. It said it was making adjustments to some business teams as its development plans for hardware had changed.

The company formed the unit in June last year, with the aim of building up a business that would include software and hardware and spearhead Tencent's bet on the metaverse concept of virtual worlds.

It also marked a rare foray into hardware for Tencent, which is mostly known for its software such as its range of games as well as social media applications.

Extended reality is a term that refers to immersive technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality, which considered as the building blocks of the metaverse.

The metaverse became the new buzz word for investors and tech companies in 2021 after Mark Zuckerberg changed Facebook's name to Meta Platforms and said he would devote the company's future to building a metaverse.

435,META,2022-12-19,"Colombia lost 86,985 hectares of forest through Sept. 30 this year -report","













BOGOTA, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Colombia has lost 86,985 hectares (214,944 acres) of Amazon jungle in the first nine months of the year while fires burned through swathes of felled areas, a local advocacy group said on Monday.

The deforestation was concentrated in 11 areas across five of the country's provinces - Meta, Caqueta, Putumayo, Guaviare and Antioquia, the Foundation for Conservation and Sustainable Development said in a report.

In September, Colombia's Environment Ministry reported that deforestation in its Amazon region rose to 52,460 hectares in the first half of the year and could finish 2022 with an 11% increase from last year.

In 2021, 174,103 hectares were lost, up 1.5% on the previous year. About two-thirds was recorded in the country's Amazon.

Preservation of the Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, is considered vital to curbing catastrophic climate change, because of the vast amount of greenhouse gas it absorbs.

From January through September, Colombia recorded 107,823 alerts regarding fires in forests, equivalent to 359 fires a day and up 30% on the same period in 2021, the report said.

This was despite the La Nina weather phenomenon bringing wetter, inclement weather to the Andean country, it added. La Nina occurs when sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean cool below normal levels, usually leading to increased rainfall in Colombia.

The Environment Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Environment Minister Susana Muhamad, who was sworn in after President Gustavo Petro took control of the country in August, told Reuters earlier this year that fighting deforestation would be a priority for the new leftist government.

436,META,2023-01-27,Australia regulator to probe social media influencers for false endorsements,"













SYDNEY, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Australia's competition regulator said on Friday it would check whether influencers on social media platforms had failed to disclose their affiliation with the brands they were promoting.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said it would look at more than 100 influencers after several consumers informed the regulator about some endorsements and testimonials which they said were misleading.

""The number of tip-offs reflects the community concern about the ever-increasing number of manipulative marketing techniques on social media, designed to exploit or pressure consumers into purchasing goods or services,"" ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said in a statement.

As part of the sweep, ACCC has begun reviewing Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) Facebook and Instagram, TikTok, Snap Inc's (SNAP.N) Snapchat, Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) YouTube and Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) streaming service Twitch, Cass-Gottlieb said.

The probe will target influencers in fashion, cosmetics, food and beverage, travel, fitness, parenting, gaming and technology. It will also check if advertisers, marketers, brands and social media platforms are facilitating any misconduct.

Individuals who breach Australian consumer laws could be fined up to A$2.5 million ($1.78 million).

The ACCC has been conducting a series of investigations as part of a broader Digital Platform Services Inquiry, focused on the provision of social media services, including sponsored posts and influencer advertising on social media platforms. It is expected to submit its sixth interim report by March 31.

437,META,2023-02-27,New Zealand launches global fundraiser for post-cyclone reconstruction,"













SYDNEY, Feb 27 (Reuters) - New Zealand will launch an international fundraising appeal for the massive reconstruction work needed after Cyclone Gabrielle tore across the country's north earlier this month, forcing thousands of people into shelters and killing eleven.

The appeal will fund longer term recovery projects and target wealthy expatriates, businesses and anyone with affection for New Zealand, said Prime Minister Chris Hipkins on Monday. Facebook owner Meta (META.O) has offered to promote the appeal, he added.

""One of the things we know from past events is that there are people abroad with very strong connections to New Zealand who want to be able to make a contribution,"" Hipkins said at a news conference announcing the initiative.

The appeal will be modeled after the 2011 Christchurch earthquake fundraiser, which collected over NZ$94 million ($57.94 million).

Cyclone Gabrielle hit New Zealand's North Island on Feb. 12 and battered roads and bridges, left tens of thousands without power across an area that makes up a third of the country. Police are still searching for 4 missing people.

A national state of emergency, only the third declared in the country's history, will continue in cyclone-hit regions.

Hipkins said the government was considering ""all the options"" to pay for reconstruction, forecast to be a similar price tag to the NZ$13.5 billion spent after the Christchurch earthquake.

The government is under pressure to avoid spending that could worsen inflation after New Zealand's central bank raised interest rates to the highest level in 14 years and flagged more hikes to come.

HANOI, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Vietnam's government has ordered technology firms to store their users' data locally and set up local offices, its latest move to tighten cybersecurity rules.

The new rules, issued in a decree on Wednesday, will apply to social media companies like Alphabet Inc.'s Google (GOOGL.O) and Meta's Facebook (META.O), and telecommunications operators, and will take effect on October 1.

""Data of all internet users ranging from financial records and biometric data to information on peoples' ethnicity and political views, or any data created by users while surfing the internet must be to stored domestically,"" the decree stated.

Authorities will have the right to issue data collection requests for purpose of investigation and to ask service providers to remove content if it is deemed to violate the government's guidelines, the decree added.

Foreign firms will have 12 months to set up local data storage and representative offices after receiving instructions from the Minister of Public Security, and will have to store the data onshore for a minimum period of 24 months, according to the decree.

Two tech firms contacted by Reuters, Google and Meta, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Vietnam is run by the Communist Party, which maintains tight media censorship and tolerates little dissent. It has tightened internet rules over the past few years, culminating in a cybersecurity law that came into effect in 2019 and national guidelines on social media behaviour introduced in June last year.

439,META,2022-11-07,Twitter owner Musk backs Republicans on eve of U.S. midterms,"Summary

Summary Companies Biden's Democrats in tough battle to keep control of Congress

Musk comments unlikely to have effect on voter behavior -analyst















WASHINGTON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Elon Musk, Twitter's new owner, urged Americans to elect a Republican Congress in U.S. midterms on Tuesday to counterbalance President Joe Biden's Democrats, the first time a major social media CEO explicitly took a side.

""Shared power curbs the worst excesses of both parties, therefore I recommend voting for a Republican Congress, given that the Presidency is Democratic,"" Musk said in a tweet on Monday to his more than 110 million followers.

Republicans are favored to win a majority in the House of Representatives in Tuesday's elections, with the Senate rated a toss-up by nonpartisan election forecasters. Democrats currently control both houses.

Musk, the world's richest person and CEO of Tesla (TSLA.O), took over Twitter in a $44 billion deal last month and has engaged in drastic measures including sacking half the staff and a plan to charge for blue check verification marks.

His absolutist stance on free speech has led some groups to warn against a rise in misinformation and some advertisers to pull their spending. A crackdown on users impersonating Musk prompted Twitter to suspend comedian Kathy Griffin.

Later, he added, ""I'm open to the idea of voting Democrat again in the future"" and said he had historically been an independent who had voted for Democrats.

Musk has been critical of the Biden administration and Democrats for their proposals to tax billionaires and give more tax incentives to union-made electric vehicles. Tesla does not have unions at its U.S. factories.

Republicans could use a majority in either chamber to bring Biden's agenda to a halt and launch potentially politically damaging investigations into Biden's administration and family.

Kyle Kondik, from the University of Virginia' Center for Politics, said it was unlikely Musk's words would influence the election's outcome.

""It's hard to expect any sort of celebrity 'endorsement,' as this basically is, to have much if any effect on voter behavior,"" Kondik said.

Asked about Musk's comments, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said: ""The president has often spoken about the importance of voting, and I'm just going to leave it there as to not get involved in any kind of election conversation.""

Former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich described Musk's comments as ""very encouraging.""

NEW LINE FOR SOCIAL MEDIA EXECS

Musk is not alone among social media executives in taking open political stances.

Sheryl Sandberg, former operating officer of Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), for instance, has donated heavily to progressive candidates and endorsed Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Like other executives, however, Sandberg stopped short of explicitly telling her followers how to vote and took pains to keep a distance between her personal leanings and her work.

Former Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey has voiced a sense of alienation from both Republican and Democratic politics, while Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and his wife donated to two nonprofits that distributed grants to state and local governments to help them conduct elections.

In a statement to Reuters, Jessica Gonzalez, co-CEO of Free Press, an advocacy group, said Musk's comment showed he ""is not showing himself to be an even-keeled CEO that advertisers can trust.""

Last year Tesla moved its headquarters from California - its biggest market - to the more conservative state Texas. Musk also moved his personal residence from California to Texas, where there is no state income tax.

In April, Musk said on Twitter he believes that for the platform ""to deserve public trust, it must be politically neutral.""

Federal authorities are investigating Musk over his conduct in acquiring Twitter, the company said in a court filing last month. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission have not commented on any potential probes. read more

440,META,2022-10-07,ByteDance might deserve its most-watched status,"













HONG KONG, Oct 7 (Reuters Breakingviews) - A rare report card from China’s ByteDance explains how the TikTok parent is putting a floor under the $300 billion valuation at which it is buying back a small slug of shares. It’s a good show despite a stalled initial public offering plan, a global tech rout, and a politically difficult reception for its popular short-video streaming app.

As part of an extended employee stock incentive programme in August, the Chinese social media giant shared with staff a financial report showing revenue grew nearly 80% to $61.7 billion last year, per the Wall Street Journal. The company eked out an operating profit, too, in the first three months this year.

That implies its equity is worth 3.2 times its 2022 sales, assuming ByteDance’s full-year revenue grows to $95 billion on the back of the same 54% year-on-year pace it achieved in the first quarter. The multiple is in line with Facebook owner Meta Platforms’ (META.O) – but analysts expect that the U.S. social media company’s sales will be flat in 2022, per Refinitiv, and it has suffered a 60% decline in market value this year. ByteDance might be eating its rival’s lunch in more ways than one. (By Yawen Chen)

441,META,2022-04-28,Gizmodo-publisher G/O Media acquires business news site Quartz,"













April 28 (Reuters) - Gizmodo publisher G/O Media Inc is acquiring Quartz, the business news site said in an internal memo on Thursday, the latest in a series of consolidations in digital media.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed in the memo from Quartz Chief Executive Zach Seward.

The deal comes as publications struggle to grow revenue amid a fierce fight for advertising dollars with internet heavy-weights Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O).

Great Hill Partners-owned G/O Media will be the third owner of Quartz, which was founded in 2012. It was acquired by Tokyo-listed financial data firm Uzabase in 2018 before being taken private by Seward two years later.

""G/O, meanwhile, will help us reach a lot more people across its network and unlock new revenue streams that we couldn't on our own. And we will make this combination without any reduction in jobs,"" Seward said in the memo to staff.

Quartz generated $11.1 million in revenue in 2021, down from $12.3 million in the previous year, according to the New York Times, which first reported the deal on Thursday.

Falling revenue has pressured media companies to join hands or find new plush owners.

Last year, Verizon Inc (VZ.N) sold its media properties, including TechCrunch, Yahoo Finance and Engadget, to private equity firm Apollo Global Management (APO.N), and Vox Media merged with Group Nine Media.

442,META,2023-03-08,Google to launch fund to support Taiwan's media outlets,"













TAIPEI, March 8 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL.O) Google said on Wednesday it will launch a T$300 million ($9.8 million) fund over the next three years to help boost the Taiwanese media's continuing operations and digital competitiveness.

Google has come under pressure in some countries to negotiate commercial deals and pay news publishers for their content, though not in Taiwan.

Google said it will pay local publishers through what it calls a ""Taiwan News Digital Co-prosperity Fund"" to strengthen their digital publishing capability.

The fund will help Taiwan local media ""hone digital skills, gain expertise and support the sustainable development of Taiwan's news industry"", the company said.

""Even while Google faces many challenges in the overall international environment, Taiwan remains a crucial global stronghold,"" Tina Lin, managing director of sales and operations at Google Taiwan, told reporters in Taipei.

Google said Taiwan's media industry has been facing major competitive challenges in adapting to the digital age, pointing out that advertising revenues for traditional media outlets have dropped 70% from 2003 to 2020.

The initiative marks the latest effort by the internet giant to develop mechanisms to support and compensate regional news providers whose content appears on Google, as it faces the prospect that governments may impose regulations to require such mechanisms.

An Australian law giving the government power to compel Google and rival Meta Platforms (META.O) to negotiate content supply deals with media outlets has largely worked, according to an Australian government report in late 2022.

443,META,2022-08-03,New York Times expects weak ad revenue as slowdown worries hit spending,"













Aug 3 (Reuters) - The New York Times Co (NYT.N) forecast a drop in advertising revenue for the third quarter on Wednesday, as brands cut back on ad spending in the face of a global economic slowdown, sending its shares down 6.5% in early trading.

The worldwide market for online ads is feeling the heat of red-hot inflation and foreign exchange headwinds, driving advertising-dependent companies such as Snap Inc (SNAP.N), Meta Platforms (META.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) to curb costs and temper their outlooks.

""Given the uncertain macroeconomic environment, we'll continue to look closely at costs while prioritizing investment in areas that widen our moat like journalism and digital product development,"" the Times' chief executive officer, Meredith Kopit Levien, said on a post-earnings call.

The 171-year-old company forecast subscription revenue to rise in the range of 11% to 13% in the current quarter on bets that increased investments to bolster its digital businesses will help attract more subscribers to its news, games and podcasts at a time when ad spending has been weak.

The Times acquired sports media business The Athletic and popular game Wordle earlier this year.

Subscription revenue rose more than 13% to $383.6 million, with digital accounting for about 25% of that growth in the second quarter.

""News remains core to our value proposition, but the Bundle helps ensure that The Times is indispensable to an ever-widening group of people, even as news engagement ebbs and flows,"" Kopit Levien said.

The company added 180,000 net digital subscribers in the reported quarter.

Excluding items, the company earned 24 cents per share, beating estimates of 19 cents.

Nov 2 (Reuters) - The New York Times Co (NYT.N) topped quarterly profit estimates on Wednesday as more people signed up for its digital subscription bundle, helping offset a slowdown in advertising sales.

The publisher's shares rose 5% as it also raised its full-year adjusted operating profit outlook to the top end of its previous estimate.

The Times has been trying to reach a wider audience and boost revenue by bundling its news offerings with cooking recipes, crossword puzzles and acquired businesses such as product review site Wirecutter and sports news site The Athletic.

The company now has more than one million subscribers who opt for all-access offerings and pay about 50% more than news subscribers, Chief Executive Meredith Kopit Levien said.

The Times added 180,000 digital-only subscribers in the third quarter and said digital subscription revenue would grow by 30% to 33% in the current quarter.

The company, a beacon for newspapers struggling for advertising dollars amid competition from tech giants such as Meta and Google, has this year turned to acquisitions such as popular internet game Wordle to boost its digital business.

Still, lower-than-expected quarterly revenue of $547.7 million showed the company was not completely shielded from a wider slowdown in ad spending.

The Times' digital ads revenue rose marginally to $70.3 million in the quarter, but the company warned it expects ad sales to fall in the fourth quarter.

445,META,2022-05-02,Uneven earnings season providing little fuel for volatile U.S. stock market,"













NEW YORK, May 2 (Reuters) - Mixed financial results from U.S. megacap companies are dampening an otherwise better-than-expected first-quarter earnings season and so far failing to fuel stock performance in the face of U.S. Federal Reserve monetary tightening.

A busy week of earnings that saw big swings in the equity market was capped off on Friday by a disappointing report from Amazon (AMZN.O), whose shares tumbled 14% and dragged the S&P 500 down 3.6% on the day. The e-commerce giant delivered a disappointing quarter and outlook, swamped by higher costs to run its warehouses and deliver packages to customers. read more

""The reports from Q1 have for the most part come in better than expected although some megacaps have disappointed, and I think those disappointments have acted as an overhang to the market,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut.

The S&P 500 ended with its fourth straight weekly decline that has pulled the benchmark index down 13.3% in the first four months of the year.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq (.IXIC) fell 13.3% in April alone, its biggest monthly drop since October 2008 in the midst of the financial crisis.

Concerns over surging inflation and how aggressively the Fed plans to act to rein it in along with geopolitical worries such as the war in Ukraine and lockdowns in China continue to hang over the market, investors said.

""Those are the predominant themes, and earnings are not strong enough to overcome those other themes,"" Pavlik said.

With 275 companies reported, S&P 500 earnings were on track to have climbed 10.1% in the first quarter from the year-earlier period, up from an expectation of a 6.4% increase at the start of April, according to Refinitiv data as of Friday.

So far, 80.4% of companies have reported earnings above analysts estimates. That beat rate is above 66% for a typical quarter since 1994, but just below the 83% rate of the past four quarters, according to Refinitiv.

""I would not call it a great earnings season or a horrible one,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. ""It's pretty mediocre.""

Among the standouts so far this period, Meta Platforms (FB.O) shares soared 17.6% on Thursday after the social media company surprised Wall Street with a better-than-expected rise in users joining the platform. read more

Other major stocks have not fared as well. Aside from Amazon, shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) slid on Wednesday after its report, while Netlfix (NFLX.O) shares tumbled earlier in the month after its results.

Overall, top megacap growth companies - Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft , Alphabet, Amazon and Meta - combined reported an earnings per share decline of 1.2%, according to Credit Suisse equity strategists Jonathan Golub and Manish Bangard.

That compares to a gain of 12.4% for all other S&P 500 companies, including a combination of already reported results and estimates for yet-to-be released first-quarter results, the Credit Suisse strategists said in a note.

Those big five companies also posted a lower aggregate earnings beat, of 2.3% versus 8.6% for all other companies that reported results so far as of Thursday, according to Credit Suisse.

Those five stocks ""delivered disappointing results this week,"" the bank's strategists wrote.

While many of the largest companies already have reported, nearly half the members of the S&P 500 still are on tap. Pfizer (PFE.N), Starbucks (SBUX.O) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) are among the reports due this week.

446,META,2022-07-03,UEFA steps up fight against online racist abuse of players,"













July 3 (Reuters) - UEFA is to launch a programme to combat online racist abuse of footballers by working with social media companies to remove harmful content from platforms and raising awareness, it said on Sunday.

Europe's soccer governing body added that the programme, which will start at the July 6-31 Women's European Championship, will work to ""actively monitor, report and remedy"" cases of online abuse.

England's Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka were the targets of online racist abuse after they missed penalties in a 3-2 shootout loss to Italy in last year's European Championship final.

A report published by FIFA last month revealed that more than half of players at last year's European Championship and Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) were subjected to discriminatory abuse online. read more

""The respect programme targets concrete actions to prevent abusive online behaviour and discrimination during all of its final competitions, including youth, women's and men's competition final matches for the next three years,"" UEFA said in a statement.

""To ensure that harmful content is removed, UEFA is working directly with major social media platforms such as Twitter, Meta (Instagram and Facebook) and TikTok.""

The programme will include a ""Real Scars"" campaign featuring footballers Wendie Renard, Jorginho and Alisha Lehmann.

That will ""highlight the devastating effects of online abuse"" and educate players, coaches and officials on how to defend themselves.

""When you say something on social media, you do not realise how painful it is or the consequences it can have,"" Renard said.

""It can leave a mark because we are all human, we all have emotions.""

WASHINGTON/LONDON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were mixed and European shares ended nearly flat on Thursday as investors balanced mixed earnings reports and economic data, while the pound retreated from mid-September highs.

Oil prices extended their rally on optimism over record U.S. crude exports. The U.S. dollar gained against major currencies.

The ECB raised rates by 75 basis points, in line with expectations, and signaled it was keen to start shrinking its bloated balance sheet.

The more dovish tone pushed the euro back below parity against the U.S. dollar . Yields on the benchmark 10-year German bund dropped to a three-week low of 1.978% .

U.S. treasury yields slid further after data showed growth in U.S. consumer spending slowed in the third quarter, a sign inflation is peaking and the Federal Reserve can soon ease its aggressive hiking of interest rates. read more

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 0.61% following a slew of upbeat earnings reports and data that showed U.S. economic growth rebounded in the third quarter.

The S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 0.61% and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 1.63%, pressured by weak tech sector earnings, including a slump in shares of Facebook owner Meta (META.O).

""The U.S. is not currently in recession, given the strength of the consumer sector. However, excluding the more volatile categories, the trajectory for growth looks weak,"" Jeffrey Roach, Chief Economist for LPL Financial, said.

""A silver lining is markets have possibly priced in much of the near-term recession risks.""

The MSCI world equity index (.MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell 0.57%.

Asian markets benefited from speculation among investors that major central banks are considering slowing their aggressive interest hikes, given signs of an economic slowdown.

Europe's STOXX 600 (.STOXX) ended slightly lower after recovering most of the session's losses. It touched its highest level since Sept. 20 as the European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde spoke.

London's FTSE 100 was up 0.25% (.FTSE) while Germany's DAX was up 0.12% (.GDAXI), both recovering earlier losses.

Investors are focused on the outlook for future rate hikes.

""We expect the ECB to slow its pace of rate rises, hiking 'only' another 50 bps in December,"" said Altaf Kassam, head of EMEA investment strategy and research at State Street Global Advisors.

Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) and McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) rose after reporting earnings, while Facebook-parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) slumped on a drop in third-quarter profit.

Emerging market stocks extended gains to a third straight session. MSCI's index of EM stocks (.MSCIEF) was up 0.9%.

The Bank of Canada delivered a smaller-than-expected rate hike late on Wednesday, bolstering investors' hopes that central banks would slow their aggressive pace of rate hikes.

Data on Thursday also showed the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases hurt consumer spending.

The Fed is expected to deliver a 75-bps hike in November.

The yen gave back early gains seen ahead of Friday's Bank of Japan meeting. Most analysts expect the central bank to maintain its ultra-low interest rates .

Gold eased, weighed by the greenback's advance. U.S. gold futures GCv1 settled at $1,665.60, 0.2% lower on the day. Spot prices were down 0.18%.

Brent crude settled up $1.27, or 1.3%, to $96.96 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled up $1.17, or 1.3%, to $89.08 a barrel.

449,META,2022-05-26,Big tech ad revenue growth to taper as pandemic bubble pops -analyst,"













May 26 (Reuters) - After unprecedented revenue growth last year, digital platforms including Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O), Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) now face a sobering reality as pandemic-driven advertising trends dissipate, according to an analyst report on Thursday.

Research firm MoffettNathanson cut its 2025 revenue estimates for each of the four companies by double-digit percentages.

U.S. digital ad spending surged 38% in 2021 over the previous year. Alphabet, the largest digital advertising platform in the world, posted record revenue of $257 billion that year.

While the companies have warned of pressure from inflation, the Ukraine war and the end of a COVID-induced lift to advertising, the report estimates for the first time the potential impact to revenue over the next few years.

""After years of uber-bullishness, we are truly concerned about longer-term growth in digital advertising,"" wrote Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, in the report.

Growth in the advertising market last year was driven in part by an ""unprecedented spike"" in profitability at companies that saved money on office space and expansion and had more to spend on marketing, as well as brands spending on ads to drive customers to shop online, Nathanson wrote.

But e-commerce as a percentage of retail sales has fallen back to pre-pandemic levels, and corporate expenses are likely to rise as workers return to the office, according to the report.

The firm said it now expects online advertising in the United States to grow by 12.5% annually through 2025, down from the previous estimate of 18.5% annual growth.

450,META,2022-08-12,Australian court orders Google to pay $43 million for misleading users,"













Aug 12 (Reuters) - Australia's competition watchdog said on Friday that Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google unit was ordered by the country's Federal Court to pay A$60 million ($42.7 million) in penalties for misleading users on collection of their personal location data.

The court found Google misled some customers about personal location data collected through their Android mobile devices between January 2017 and December 2018. (https://reut.rs/3Ajr3Pn)

Google misled users into believing ""location history"" setting on their android phones was the only way location data could be collected by it, when a feature to monitor web and applications activity also allowed local data collection and storage, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) said.

The watchdog, which estimates that 1.3 million Google account users in Australia may have been affected, had started the proceedings against the company and its local unit in October 2019.

Google took remedial measures in 2018, the regulator said.

In an emailed statement, Google said it had settled the matter and added it has made location information simple to manage and easy to understand.

The search engine giant has been embroiled in legal action in Australia over the past year as the government mulled and passed a law to make Google and Meta Platforms' (META.O) Facebook pay media companies for content on their platforms. (https://reut.rs/3JRaTzz)

451,META,2023-01-19,Here's what Twitter lost in advertising revenue in final months of 2022,"













NEW YORK/LONDON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Top advertisers on Twitter slashed their spending after Elon Musk's takeover, according to estimates compiled for Reuters by research firm Pathmatics, in the latest shock to the company's dominant revenue source.

Fourteen of the top 30 advertisers on Twitter stopped all advertising on the platform after Musk took charge on October 27, according to the Pathmatics estimates. Four advertisers reduced spending between 92% and 98.7% from the week before Musk's acquisition through the end of the year.

Overall, advertising spending by the top 30 companies fell by 42% to an estimated $53.8 million for November and December combined, according to Pathmatics, despite an increase in spending by six of them.

Pathmatics said the previously unreported figures on Twitter advertising are estimates. The firm bases its estimates on technologies that track ads on desktop browsers and the Twitter app as well as those that mimic user experience.

But the company said those estimates do not account for deals advertisers may receive from Twitter, or promoted trends and accounts. ""It is possible the spending data could be higher for some brands"" if Twitter is offering incentives, Pathmatics said in an email.

Twitter did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

In a November event on Twitter Spaces, Musk, addressing the issue of companies pausing ads, said that he understands if advertisers ""want to give it a minute."" He added that ""the best way to see how things are evolving (at Twitter) is just use Twitter.""

Technology-focused publication The Information, citing details shared by a top Twitter ad executive at a staff meeting on Wednesday, reported that Twitter's fourth quarter revenue fell about 35% year over year due to a slump in advertising.

Twitter posted a loss of $270 million in the three months ended June 30, on total revenue of about $1.18 billion. read more

The Pathmatics estimates show continued upheaval in Twitter's main revenue stream heading into 2023, led by a pullback from top consumer brands.

Forward bookings, or agreements to lock in future ads, were also down for January and February, according to research firm Standard Media Index, which did not provide details.

Twitter is moving to reverse the advertiser exodus. It has introduced a slew of initiatives to win back advertisers, offering some free ads, lifting a ban on political advertising and allowing companies greater control over the positioning of their ads.

""They're frankly really amazing incentives. Honestly, I've not seen that type of incentive ever from any advertiser,"" said Molly Lopez, owner of ad agency HITE Digital Miami.

In addition, Mark DiMassimo, founder of New York-based ad agency DiMassimo Goldstein, said that ""bargain basement"" direct marketers and political action committees - big spenders on Meta Platform Inc's (META.O) Facebook - may fill the advertising gap.

Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) halted spending in mid November, after purchasing an estimated $1.1 million in Twitter ads earlier that month, while HBO spending collapsed to approximately $38,000 in December from roughly $1.1 million in November, Pathmatics found.

Coca-Cola declined to comment. HBO spokesperson Chris Willard did not comment on the specifics of advertising spending, but said ""we will be assessing the platform under its new leadership and determine appropriate next steps.""

Among consumer brands, Heinz ketchup maker Kraft Heinz Co(KHC.O) and Stouffers meal manufacturer Nestle SA (NESN.S) stopped all advertising, according to the Pathmatics estimates. Heinz and Nestle declined to comment.

Mass retailer Target Corp (TGT.N) and department store operator Kohls Corp (KSS.N) also skipped advertising on Twitter on Black Friday, one of the biggest shopping days of the year, the estimates show. Kohls did not return requests for comment.

However, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and PepsiCo Inc (PEP.O) increased spending, according to Pathmatics.

Apple did not respond to requests for comment. PepsiCo declined to comment.

Financial technology provider SmartAsset and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) said Pathmatics estimates showing an increase in advertising were inaccurate. Amazon did not elaborate further and SmartAsset said the figures were ""inflated"" without giving details. Pathmatics said ""we want to reiterate that our figures are just estimates.""

BRAND SAFETY

Musk's arrival at Twitter exacerbated a drop in advertising that began in September after Reuters reported that promotions appeared alongside tweets soliciting child pornography.

Most of the companies stopped spending in November, the estimates show, the same month that Musk restored suspended accounts and released a paid account verification that resulted in scammers impersonating corporations.

Telecommunications company AT&T Inc (T.N) and pet food provider Mars Inc slashed spending in September due to concerns about brand safety.

As the companies pulled back on Twitter, they maintained and in some cases boosted advertising on Meta Platform Inc's (META.O) Facebook and Instagram and on short video app TikTok, according to Pathmatics.

Meta and TikTok did not immediately return requests for comment.

AT&T said it paused advertising in September because of ""concerns around content appearing next"" to its ads. The company has been talking to Twitter about its concerns, according to a person familiar with AT&T's thinking.

Mars said its ""suspension remains in effect.""

Twitter has said to Reuters it is investing in child safety. read more The platform is leaning on automation to moderate content and restrict abuse-prone hashtags and search results in areas including child exploitation. read more

Companies also scaled back on tweeting. As of January 19, Target and Special K cereal maker Kellogg Co (K.N) hadn't tweeted since October; Coca-Cola and electronics retailer Best Buy Co Inc(BBY.N) paused tweeting in November, according to a Reuters review of the company's main feeds.

Target, Best Buy and Kellogg did not return requests for comment.

April 26 (Reuters) - A Moscow court has ordered the seizure of 500 million roubles ($7 million) worth of Google's property and funds in Russia, news agencies said, in a lawsuit concerning restrictions the U.S. tech firm has placed on the YouTube channel of a prominent television firm.

Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL.O) Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Russian news agencies reported that the case concerns Gazprom Media Holding's GPM Entertainment Television, which filed a suit demanding that Google restore access to its YouTube account.

YouTube, which has blocked Russian state-funded media globally, is under heavy pressure from Russia's communications regulator and politicians.

Russia has blocked some other foreign internet firms, including Meta Platforms Inc.'s (FB.O) Facebook and Instagram, as it battles to control information flows after sending tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24. YouTube remains available for now.

""The claim of GPM Entertainment Television about interim measures being taken has been granted,"" Interfax quoted Moscow's Arbitration Court as saying.

It said the measures would involve ""seizing funds (including cash which will come into bank accounts) and also all movable and immovable property, owned by Google, for the total sum of 500 million roubles.""

RIA reported that the court had rejected a previous claim by GPM Entertainment Television on April 13.

Gazprom Media owns several key social media and television assets in Russia, some of which are benefiting from the exodus of and blockade of foreign internet firms. read more

HONG KONG, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) is abandoning plans to venture into virtual reality hardware, as a sobering economic outlook prompts the Chinese tech giant to cut costs and headcount at its metaverse unit, three sources familiar with the matter said.

The world's largest video game publisher had ambitious plans to build both virtual reality software and hardware at an ""extended reality"" XR unit it launched in June last year, for which it hired nearly 300 people.

It had come up with a concept for a ring-like hand-held game controller, but difficulties in achieving quick profitability and the large investment needed to produce a competitive product were among factors that prompted a shift away from that strategy, two of the sources said.

One of the sources said the XR project was not expected to become profitable until 2027, according to an internal forecast. The second source said the unit also had a lack of promising games and non-gaming applications.

The sources declined to be named as the information is confidential.

""Under the company's new strategy as a whole, it no longer quite fit in,"" the first source said.

Earlier in the year, Tencent had also planned to buy gaming phone maker Black Shark, which it believed had supply chain and inventory experience that could beef up its hardware push and add 1,000 people to the unit.

However, it eventually walked away from that deal due to Tencent's shift in strategy, as well as mounting regulatory scrutiny and an expected lengthy review process, one of the sources who had direct knowledge of the matter said.

The sources said that Tencent had advised most of the unit's staff to seek other opportunities, confirming a Thursday report from Chinese tech news outlet 36Kr.

Tencent declined to comment on the Black Shark deal and whether Beijing's scrutiny had soured the deal. Regarding the status of the XR unit, the company referred to a statement to Reuters on Thursday that said it was making adjustments to some business teams as development plans for hardware had changed.

The company also said on Thursday that it was not disbanding the XR unit.

Tencent shares slipped as much as 2.5% after Reuters' report.

METAVERSE INTEREST

The launch of the XR unit came amid swelling global interest in the metaverse concept of virtual worlds and had marked a rare foray into hardware for Tencent, which is mostly known for software that includes a suite of games and social media applications.

It also entered into a race against Western peers such as Meta Platforms (META.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), which are building their own metaverses and have their own virtual reality hardware projects.

One of the sources said that Tencent had dabbled in virtual reality about seven years ago for a short while, and its interest in the area had been revived in 2021 after learning of new breakthroughs in pancake lenses and more powerful displays. Strong sales of Meta's Quest headset was also a driver, the person added.

But last year marked one of the toughest years for Tencent since its founding in 1998, with revenue battered by a regulatory crackdown and headwinds from measures to stop the spread of COVID-19.

Underlining such strains, its founder Pony Ma in December displayed a rare show of frustration at a year-end meeting when he lambasted senior managers for not working hard enough and said the company needed to focus on short video for future growth.

Several tech companies include Meta and Google have announced layoffs as they seek to trim costs amid rising fears of a global recession.

Pico, a virtual reality (VR) headset manufacturer owned by TikTok's Chinese developer ByteDance, said on Friday it was laying off a small number of people, after local media reported the start of hundreds of redundancies earlier this week. A source familiar with the matter said 200 staff were affected.

454,META,2022-09-09,U.S. business groups warn Vietnam data rules may threaten investment,"













HANOI, Sept 9 (Reuters) - U.S. business groups warned on Friday a new regulation in Vietnam that will make technology firms store data locally and set up a local office was creating uncertainty and could have a ""considerable impact"" on investment.

In a joint letter to Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Chamber of Commerce Hanoi and the Asia Internet Coalition, said the new regulation would make it impossible for companies to accurately assess the cost of doing business in Vietnam.

""The wording of certain articles/clauses...is ambiguous and creates uncertainty as to what compliance actions are necessary,"" according to the letter.

The business associations requested in the letter that the government provide more detailed guidance on the interpretation of the regulation.

The new rules, announced last month, are expected to take effect on Oct. 1 and apply to technology companies as well as telecommunication operators and data storage providers. read more

Once the rules are implemented, companies will have to store personal data in the country for at least two years and set up local data storage and a representative office within a year.

Vietnam is run by the Communist Party, which maintains tight media censorship and tolerates little dissent.

It has tightened internet rules over the past few years, culminating in a cybersecurity law that came into effect in 2019 and national guidelines on social media behaviour introduced in June last year.

Vietnam's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Two tech firms contacted by Reuters, Alphabet Inc's Google and Meta, also did not immediately respond.

June 13 (Reuters) - Yahoo on Monday named six people from the tech, media and financial industries to its board, including Hollywood actress Jessica Alba, as the company aims to diversify its offerings to compete with bigger players.

Yahoo, which sprung up during the age of desktop PCs hooked up to dial-up internet connections, has been looking to grow its offerings to compete with companies such as Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) Facebook.

Last year, Apollo Global Management Inc (APO.N) closed a $5 billion acquisition of Verizon Media (VZ.N) and renamed it Yahoo after Verizon's iconic digital brand.

Since then, the website has focused on building out Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Sports, while also focusing on advertising and ecommerce platforms. Yahoo named dating app Tinder's boss Jim Lanzone as its chief executive officer after the deal closed. read more

Alba, who is also the co-founder of consumer wellness products firm Honest Company (HNST.O), will be joined by Aryeh Bourkoff, the chief executive officer of LionTree, a bank that has advised some of the biggest media mergers, as well as Fouad ElNaggar, the CEO of tech firms Array and Sapho.

Yahoo also appointed to its board Michael Kives, founder of investment firm K5 Global, Katie Stanton, who has served in executive operating roles at Twitter (TWTR.N) and Google, as well as Cynthia Marshall, the CEO of American basketball team Dallas Mavericks.

JOHANNESBURG, Dec 13 (Reuters) - MTN South Africa (MTNJ.J) and MTN GlobalConnect, in partnership with a consortium, have landed a 45,000 kilometre subsea cable in South Africa, part of plans to build a subsea network to connect African countries to Europe and the Middle East.

Africa's big economies have a fast growing population of internet users, with growth fuelled by rapidly expanding mobile broadband networks and affordable smartphones.

But the continent still lags behind the rest of the world in internet connectivity.

""Data traffic across African markets is expected to grow between four and five fold over the next 5 years, so we need infrastructure and capacity to meet that level of growth and demand,"" MTN Group Chief Executive Ralph Mupita said in a statement.

The subsea cable project, called 2Africa which will go live in 2023, aims to build subsea cable infrastructure which will directly connect countries around the African coast to Europe and the Middle East.

MTN subsidiary MTN GlobalConnect said the landing for the cable was in Yzerfontein and Duynefontein, in the Western Cape province of South Africa and the subsea cable system will support the western and eastern sides of Africa once complete in 2023 and 2024 respectively.

Subsea cables are the backbone of the internet, carrying 99% of the world's data traffic.

The consortium includes MTN GlobalConnect, China Mobile International, Meta (META.O), French telecoms company Orange SA (ORAN.PA), Telecom Egypt, Vodafone (VOD.L), Mauritius-based infrastructure provider WIOCC and Saudi Arabia's center3.

457,META,2022-10-31,Mexican president urges Twitter to repair 'damage' done to Trump,"













MEXICO CITY, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Twitter should undo the ""damage"" done to former U.S. President Donald Trump by the cancellation of his account, Mexico's president said on Monday, as he expressed hope that new owner Elon Musk would curb censorship on the social media platform.

The remarks by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador came just days before U.S. midterm elections in which the Republican Party is forecast to make congressional gains against President Joe Biden's Democrats.

Speaking at a regular news conference, Lopez Obrador urged Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) CEO Musk to ""repair the damage done by the cancellation of President Trump's account"" and to free Twitter from what he described as ""conservative control.""

Lopez Obrador had previously backed Musk's takeover of Twitter, encouraging him to ""clean up"" the social network.

In 2021, the Mexican leader also chided Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg for blocking Trump on Facebook after the Jan. 6, 2021 storming of the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters.

Musk completed the $44 billion purchase of Twitter last week and has begun implementing sweeping changes, including sacking top executives and a planned overhaul of content moderation.

Trump said he was ""very happy Twitter is now in sane hands,"" but has yet to reveal whether he could return to the site.

Trump was banned from Twitter over accusations of inciting violence during the 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol.

458,META,2023-03-02,EU's Vestager says scrutiny of competition in metaverse already needed,"













BRUSSELS, March 2 (Reuters) - The metaverse, shared virtual worlds accessible via the Internet, is the next digital market to attract regulatory scrutiny, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Thursday.

The metaverse has come into sharper focus since Facebook changed its name to Meta Platforms (META.O) two years ago to reflect its bet on the new sector as the successor to the mobile internet.

That move has in turn triggered concerns about Meta's possible dominance. Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google and Microsoft (MSFT.O) are also active in generative artificial intelligence that the industry sees as the new bright spot.

""It's already time for us to start asking what healthy competition would look like in the metaverse,"" Vestager said a conference organised by Keystone Strategy.

Vestager asked whether it would change the equation when there are competing digital realities and language AI models like ChatGPT.

""Do we need to do more on something new? And obviously we have started that work,"" she said.

She said regulatory scrutiny of digital markets has been escalating worldwide in the last three years.

""And there's a much wider political debate that digital markets need careful attention. I think all jurisdictions are moving forward in one form or another,"" Vestager said.

She said some antitrust enforcers were more advanced than others.

""We are moving at different speeds. We will not get the same legal framework. And maybe that is not a bad thing. Because that will allow us to hone our toolkits in the process of mutual learning,"" Vestager said.

459,META,2022-09-28,U.S. House advances bill to boost antitrust efforts,"













WASHINGTON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday voted to advance a bill that would update fees companies pay for merger reviews and strengthen state attorneys general in antitrust fights, according to Majority Leader Steny Hoyer's office.

The bill combines measures introduced by Representative Joe Neguse, a Democrat, and Representative Ken Buck, a Republican.

The next step is for the full House to vote on final passage.

It would allow state attorneys general to choose which court they want to hear antitrust cases. Defendants would not be allowed to request a change of venue.

Texas, along with other states, brought an antitrust action against Alphabet Inc's <GOOGL.O> Google in 2020 that the search and advertising giant succeeded in moving from Texas to a New York court, angering conservatives.

Representative Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat, joined with at least four other California Democrats to urge that the bill be defeated because of the venue measure. California is home to some of the biggest tech companies, including Google and Meta Platforms' (META.O) Facebook.

The measure also would lower the fees paid for antitrust reviews of smaller deals. But bigger deals would be more expensive. Deals worth $5 billion or more would pay $2.25 million to regulators conducting the antitrust review.

The reviews are conducted by the U.S. Justice Department's Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission.

The Senate has passed a bill giving state attorneys general the right to pick the venue for antitrust fights but has not passed a bill to update merger filing fees.

460,META,2023-01-03,Elon Musk's Twitter lifts ban on political ads,"













Jan 4 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc will reverse its 2019 ban on political ads, the company's head of trust and safety confirmed to Reuters on Wednesday, as the Elon Musk-owned company seeks to grow revenue.

The company tweeted on Tuesday it would relax its advertising policy for ""cause-based ads"" in the United States and align its ad policy with TV and other media outlets.

The change brings Twitter's policies closer to Meta Platform's (META.O) Facebook and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) YouTube, which allow political advertising. One platform that still bans political ads is Chinese video app TikTok.

""We believe that cause-based advertising can facilitate public conversation around important topics,"" the social media company tweeted.

Cause-based ads that will be allowed on Twitter include ads that educate or raise awareness of issues such as voter registration, climate change or government programs like the Census, said Ella Irwin, Twitter's head of trust and safety, in an email.

Twitter banned political ads in 2019 after it and other social media companies faced widespread criticism for allowing election misinformation to spread. It also restricted ads related to social causes.

""We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought,"" tweeted Jack Dorsey, Twitter's then-chief executive, in announcing the move.

Since Musk took over Twitter in late October, corporate advertisers have fled in response to the Tesla (TSLA.O) CEO laying off thousands of employees, reversing the permanent suspension of former U.S. President Donald Trump and rushing a paid verification feature that resulted in scammers impersonating publicly listed companies on Twitter.

Last month, Musk defended his deep cost-cutting measures and said Twitter had been facing ""negative cash flow"" of $3 billion next year.

461,META,2023-02-03,U.S. antitrust agency preparing lawsuit against Amazon - WSJ,"Companies Amazon.com Inc Follow















Feb 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is preparing a possible antitrust lawsuit against e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

It could not be determined exactly which aspects of Amazon's businesses the FTC would target and the timing of any case was uncertain, according to the report.

Amazon and the FTC declined to comment.

The commission began probing Amazon during the Trump administration. The company has been criticized for allegedly favoring its own products and disfavoring outside sellers on its platform.

The FTC has been scrutinizing the bundling practices of the company's Prime subscription service, the WSJ also reported.

Amazon in December reached a settlement with the European Union in three antitrust probes after it addressed the EU's concerns over use of sellers' data, saving the company from a fine of up to 10% of its global turnover.

Outsiders got a small view into the relationship between the agency and Amazon last August when the agency rejected an Amazon bid to quash demands that both Chief Executive Andy Jassy and Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos testify at investigative hearings. Amazon had questioned what it called the agency's ""burdensome"" requests in its investigation of the sign-up and cancellation processes for its Prime program.

The Justice Department and FTC have probes underway of all four platforms. The Justice Department has sued Alphabet's Google twice, once regarding its search business and a second time on advertising technology. The FTC has sued Meta's Facebook.

The FTC has also lost a court ruling aimed at stopping a deal that Meta undertook to buy VR company Within.

BRUSSELS, Oct 27 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are looking to establish a 40-man team and hire a technology expert to enforce tough new rules aimed at reining in the powers of Big Tech, an EU official said on Thursday.

The rules known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA) sets out a list of do's and don'ts for Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Meta (META.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and other gatekeepers which control access to their sites and the data there.

Reuters exclusively reported in July that the European Commission was considering creating a new directorate to allay concerns that it may struggle to get deep-pocketed and well-advised tech companies to comply with the new rules.

A 12-man unit headed by antitrust veteran Thomas Kramler who is currently handling the Apple and Amazon antitrust investigations and a 9-person strong taskforce will move to the new directorate, the official said.

The EU competition enforcer aims to hire 19 more people for the directorate and a chief technology officer to focus on data, the official said.

The new unit will need the green light from the college of commissioners from the 27 EU countries in the coming weeks before it can be set up.

Enforcement of the DMA will be done jointly with the Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology which has also set up a new unit for the task.

The Commission has previously said some 80 enforcers would be needed.

463,META,2022-06-02,U.S. tech sector sees highest job cuts in May since Dec. 2020- report,"













June 2 (Reuters) - U.S. employers in the technology sector cut nearly nine times more jobs in May than in the first four months of the year as rising inflation and slowing demand force companies to cut corners.

Though overall layoffs in the country reported by global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas on Thursday fell 14.7% in May from April, thanks to strong demand in the labor market, the technology sector cut 4,044 jobs, up from the 459 between January and April.

It is the highest monthly total since December 2020 when tech companies cut as many as 5,253 jobs.

""Many technology startups that saw tremendous growth in 2020, particularly in the real estate, financial, and delivery sectors, are beginning to see a slowdown in users, and coupled with inflation and interest rate concerns, are restructuring their workforces to cut costs,"" said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of challenger, Gray & Christmas.

U.S. tech layoffs and sector performance

The impact of the Ukraine crisis, a four-decade high inflation and rising interest rates has led to forecast cuts by companies such as Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), while others like Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) have slowed hiring to rein in costs.

Fintech companies also announced 268% more job cuts in May than in the first four months of 2022, the report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.

However, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 200,000 for the week ended May 28, the Labor Department said on Thursday. read more

464,META,2023-03-08,Australian regulator to monitor rapid growth in digital platforms sector,"













March 8 (Reuters) - The Australian competition regulator said on Wednesday it would probe the country's fast-evolving ecosystem of digital platform service providers as part of a five-year inquiry into the sector.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said consumers and businesses are becoming increasingly dependent on products and services offered by digital platforms such as Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Meta (META.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), and it's crucial to examine how these giants are expanding their reach in the country.

The regulator said it will look into procedures adopted by the sector such as creating confusing interfaces known as ""dark patterns"", which can ""manipulate users into taking certain actions"", as well as conditional service offerings, also known as ""tying"", that restrict access to particular services.

""Interconnected products ... can provide consumers with a seamless experience that simplifies everyday tasks, but it's important that competition and consumers are not harmed as digital platforms invest across different sectors and technologies and expand their reach,"" ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said.

ACCC also published an issues paper, seeking feedback from consumers, businesses and relevant stakeholders concerning the investment choices made by digital platforms and the potential effect on competition and consumers.

This follows the ACCC announcing in January that it had conducted a sweep to identify misleading testimonials and endorsements by social media influencers across a range of digital platforms.

465,META,2023-02-22,Comcast takes advantage of AI rally to sell more BuzzFeed shares,"













Feb 22 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp has cut its stake in BuzzFeed Inc by 8.5% since the end of January, cashing in on a rally in the shares of the digital media company on reports of a plan to partner with OpenAI, the artificial intelligence firm behind ChatGPT.

It has so far sold more than 11 million BuzzFeed shares (BZFD.O) since Jan. 30, reducing its stake to 15.5% from 24%. The sale fetched Comcast about $28 million, according to a Reuters calculation.

It sold roughly four million shares for an average price of around $2.90 apiece at the end of January, and most recently dumped another 500,000 shares for an average of $2.05 a share, filings by Comcast (CMCSA.O) showed.

NBCUniversal, Comcast's entertainment unit, had invested $200 million in BuzzFeed in 2015 and injected another $200 million in 2016, valuing the company at around $1.7 billion.

As of Tuesday's close, BuzzFeed had a market value of just about $250 million. The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Shares of BuzzFeed, which were trading at 69 cents at the close of 2022, surged as high as $4.25 in January following media reports of a multi-million dollar content deal with Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and plans to use OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Retail investor interest in AI-related shares have been rising since last month after OpenAI drew a multi-billion dollar investment from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

BuzzFeed, which is known for its online quizzes, reduced its workforce in 2022 as businesses cut down on ad spending on concerns over a slowing economy.

Its shares were down 5.4% on Wednesday, while Comcast rose 0.6%.

466,META,2022-05-13,Do spam bots really comprise under 5% of Twitter users? Elon Musk wants to know,"













May 13 (Reuters) - Since 2013, Twitter has downplayed the spread of fake accounts on its platform, holding that ""false or spam"" accounts make up less than 5% of its user base even as independent researchers said the number could be three times higher.

That discrepancy could now affect the outcome of Elon Musk's $44 billion cash deal after the billionaire tweeted on Friday that the takeover bid was ""temporarily on hold"" while he sought information about the number of phony Twitter accounts. read more

While this may be little more than a negotiating tactic by Musk, what is clear is that almost nothing is certain when it comes to how these accounts are defined or dispensed with, according to current employees and independent social media researchers.

The social media platform said in a May 2 public filing that fewer than 5% of its 229 million daily active users who are targeted with advertising are ""false or spam"" based on an internal review of a sample of its accounts. It did not specify how that figure accounted for the automated, parody and pseudonymous profiles permitted on the platform.

Twitter did not respond to requests for comment.

Researchers estimate that anywhere from 9% to 15% of the millions of Twitter profiles are automated accounts, or bots, based on one early study, from 2017, and more recent research from a firm that monitors online conversations.

""They have underestimated that number,"" said Dan Brahmy, CEO of the Israeli tech company Cyabra that uses machine learning to identify fake accounts.

Cyabra estimates the percentage of inauthentic Twitter profiles at 13.7%.

Questions about the role bots play in spreading misinformation have dogged all social media platforms since 2016, when Russia meddled in the U.S. presidential election in a bid to boost Donald Trump's candidacy and harm his opponent Hillary Clinton.

Meta, which owns competitor platforms Facebook and Instagram, likewise estimates that fake accounts represent about 5% of monthly active users on Facebook, according to its most recent data from the fourth quarter of 2021. Meta also estimates that about 11% are ""duplicate"" accounts in which a single user maintains more than one account, a practice considered acceptable on Twitter.

Twitter's rules do bar impersonation and spam, meaning ""fake"" accounts are banned if the company determines that their purpose is to ""deceive or manipulate others"" by, for example, engaging in scams, coordinating abuse campaigns or artificially inflating engagement.

CLEARING OUT SPAM

Over the years, Twitter has invested in clearing out spam accounts. In 2018, Twitter acquired a company called Smyte, which specialized in spam prevention, safety and security. Twitter removed ""spammy and suspicious accounts"" in a effort to improve the health of the platform, which caused its user base to drop by 1 million in July 2018 and its stock to tumble.

Researcher Filippo Menczer from Indiana University's Observatory on Social Media said Twitter has gotten more aggressive at taking down these types of inauthentic accounts, though the nature of the threat is evolving and harder to quantify.

""Manipulation has also become more sophisticated,"" with coordinated networks and so-called cyborg accounts controlled by both humans and software, Menczer said, adding that these bad actors can ""flood the network and then delete their content to evade detection.""

Even if the numbers are actually small, bots can have an outsized impact, and a handful can have major influence in shaping online conversation, according to researchers.

One Carnegie Mellon University study analyzing the spread of COVID-19 falsehoods in 2020 found that of the top 50 influential retweeters, 82% were bots.

Inside Twitter, the measurement and detection of false or spam accounts is a complex problem that is not well defined or understood by many of the company's own employees, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Twitter uses varying metrics and definitions to measure such accounts, which are also dependent on the company's accuracy in detecting content that constitutes spam, one of those sources said. It also is challenged in its ability to accurately estimate the number of fake and spam accounts - and new accounts are always being created, the source said.

""Metric and data transparency at Twitter has been abysmal forever,"" said another source, blaming disorganized management. ""Plausible deniability has been the safest route for Twitter leadership.""

467,META,2022-07-06,Facebook asks U.S. court for old FTC merger documents in antitrust fight,"













WASHINGTON, July 6 (Reuters) - Meta's Facebook has asked a U.S. court for eight documents created by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission as part of their review of the company's purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp, which the agency allowed to go forward.

The request was made late on Tuesday and comes in a lawsuit filed by the FTC that has asked the court to order both of those deals undone. Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014.

The FTC sued Meta's Facebook in 2020, during the Trump administration, alleging that the company acted illegally to maintain its social network monopoly.

Facebook is fighting the lawsuit, and wants the materials as part of that fight.

""Both the Instagram and the WhatsApp documents are almost certain to reveal that the FTC determined that each acquisition was unlikely to lessen competition or harm consumers,"" Facebook said in its filing.

The company argued that the FTC had given the documents to the House Judiciary Committee when it probed the tech giants, also including Amazon(AMZN.O), Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O) and Apple (AAPL.O). Current FTC Chair Lina Khan was on the staff of that committee.

""Any claim of privilege was waived when the FTC chose to voluntarily share the documents with House Judiciary Committee members and staff,"" Facebook said in its filing.

The FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the filing.

Among the documents being requested are the memos that the FTC Bureau of Competition and Bureau of Economics wrote for commissioners about whether the Instagram deal should be allowed to close. Meta is also asking for notes made by Bureau of Competition personnel about the WhatsApp transaction.

""Twitter will always be free for casual users, but maybe a slight cost for commercial/government users,"" Musk said in a tweet. ""Some revenue is better than none!"" he added in another tweet.

Twitter declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.

Last week, Reuters reported that Musk told banks he would develop new ways to monetize tweets and crack down on executive pay to slash costs at the social media platform company. read more

Musk also told the banks he planned to develop features to grow business revenue, including new ways to make money out of tweets that contain important information or go viral, sources told Reuters.

At the annual Met Gala in New York on Monday, Musk said the reach of Twitter was currently only ""niche,"" and he would want a much bigger percentage of the country to be on it. read more

Musk, also the chief executive officer of top electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), has been suggesting a raft of changes to Twitter since last month.

In tweets which were subsequently deleted, Musk suggested changes to Twitter Blue premium subscription service, including slashing its price, banning advertising and giving an option to pay in the cryptocurrency dogecoin.

After inking the deal to buy Twitter for $44 billion last week, Musk said he wanted to enhance the platform with new features, make the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeat spam bots, and authenticate all humans. read more

ABUJA, May 17 (Reuters) - Nigeria is monitoring Meta Platforms Inc's (FB.O) Facebook and other platforms to ensure they comply with demands to curtail hate speech on their sites, as it steps up its campaign for responsible use of social media, Information Minister Lai Mohammed said on Tuesday.

Mohammed's comments came after meeting with Facebook's team in Nigeria's capital, Abuja. He said Facebook had done nothing to curtail the activities of separatist group Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) on their platform despite several complaints.

Nnamdi Kanu, IPOB's leader, is standing trial on charges that include terrorism and broadcasting falsehoods. A judge will decide on Wednesday on whether Kanu should be granted bail. read more

Mohammed said the separatist group has been classified as a terrorist organisation and that ""Facebook has no justification for yielding its platform to the organisation to further its campaign of hate and destabilisation of the country"".

Nigeria is facing secessionist agitation which has given rise to regional calls for power-sharing between southern and northern Nigeria.

The country is also dealing with insecurity, banditry, kidnapping, a weak currency amid double-digit inflation and slow growth.

Mohammed said the Facebook meeting was called to discuss the increasing use of the social media platform by separatists based outside Nigeria to instigate violence and ethnic hatred in the country in English and local language.

He said the government has no intention of preventing Nigerians from using social media but is advocating responsible use.

Nigeria lifted a six-months ban on Twitter (TWTR.N) in January after the social media company removed a post from President Muhammadu Buhari that threatened to punish regional secessionists. Telecoms companies subsequently blocked access to users in Nigeria. read more

JAKARTA, Aug 3 (Reuters) - U.S. payments firm PayPal (PYPL.O) has registered as an electronic systems operator in Indonesia and its customers can now access its services, the company said on Wednesday.

PayPal was one of several websites that Indonesia blocked at the weekend because of their failure to comply with new licensing rules. read more

Companies were given a July deadline to register under new rules that would allow authorities to compel platforms to disclose data of certain users and take down content deemed unlawful or that ""disturbs public order"" within four hours if urgent, and 24 hours if not.

Johnny G. Plate, Indonesia's communications minister, on Wednesday urged people to avoid using unregistered services ""to minimize a loss that may incur, if...illegal acts occur in those private services.""

The Communications Ministry said it also unblocked access to services of the search engine Yahoo and video-game company Valve Corporation, including Steam and Dota 2, on Tuesday after it said it had blocked them on Saturday.

The new licensing rules have courted controversy as activists and the public fear that the government may police social media content.

Though the licensing rules were first introduced in 2020, companies like Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and its units - which include Instagram and WhatsApp - as well as Alphabet Inc's Google registered just hours or days before the deadline in late July. Spotify (SPOT.N), Netflix (NFLX.O), and ByteDance's TikTok have also signed up.

With a young, tech-savvy population of 270 million, Indonesia is a top-10 market in terms of user numbers for a host of social media companies.

DAVOS, Switzerland, May 25 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) CEO Cristiano Amon sees growth for the chip supplier as consumers increasingly want ""better phones,"" he said in an interview on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum, even as talk about an economic slowdown dominates the event in the Swiss ski town of Davos.

""Qualcomm has redefined its mobile strategy to be focused on premium and high-tier, and we’re winning share in a flat market,"" Amon said. ""For example, with devices such as the Samsung Galaxy, we had a 40% share and now we have in excess of 75%.""

Amon said the market for smartphones is ""mature,"" limiting growth. Risks to the global economy have topped the concerns of the world's business leaders, policy makers and academics at the annual Davos gathering, with some citing the threat of a worldwide recession. read more

Amon said that throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the usefulness of smartphones continued to increase, with greater reliance for Zoom meetings at work and school and for staying in touch with family.

""People are looking to have better phones, with more capabilities"" Amon said. ""Those are things that may keep the mobile market stable even in the face of inflation and with the risk of a slowdown.""

BRUSSELS, June 17 (Reuters) - Cross-border Big Tech privacy cases should be handled by the EU watchdog rather than national agencies, the head of the bloc's data protection watchdog said on Friday as he lamented the poor enforcement of landmark rules adopted four years ago.

The rules known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have drawn criticism over the costs of compliance and long-running investigations with few decisions.

The Irish regulator, which has oversight of Google (GOOGL.O), Meta , Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N), has in particular come under fire for its slow pace of enforcement.

One solution could be to hand over big cases to the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) whose members are national privacy regulators and the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) which oversees EU institutions, EDPS head Wojciech Wiewiorowski said.

""I myself share views of those who believe we still do not see sufficient enforcement, in particular against Big Tech,"" he told a conference.

""At a certain moment, a pan-European data protection enforcement model is going to be a necessary step to ensure real and consistent high-level protection of fundamental rights to data protection and privacy across the European Union,"" Wiewiorowski said.

He said this could mean that key investigations, based on a certain threshold, would be done at a central level, in essence the EDPB, and subject to direct scrutiny of Europe's top court.

Empowering the EDPB to take on Big Tech cases directly would mean changing GDPR rules, a move which the European Commission is unlikely to do under the current leadership because of insufficient time, a European Commission official told Reuters.

473,META,2022-06-23,Russia's Yandex opens public access to AI large language model,"Summary

Summary Companies This content was produced in Russia where the law restricts coverage of Russian military operations in Ukraine















MOSCOW, June 23 (Reuters) - Russian technology company Yandex (YNDX.O) said on Thursday it had made a large language model for artificial intelligence research open to the public, hoping to spawn faster and deeper development of certain AI technologies.

Large language models, which have become a key trend in AI, are powerful programs that can generate paragraphs of text and mimic human conversation.

Yandex, like many Russian companies, has endured a turbulent few months since Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24.

The company, whose business lines range from online search to e-commerce and ride-hailing services, plunged to a first-quarter loss, has flagged possible negative consequences from sanctions against Russia and has lost its chief executive and deputy chief executive. read more

Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) on Wednesday released what it said was the largest unrestricted, open-sourced artificial intelligence model to date, a 66 billion-parameter language model, having made a 175 billion-parameter model available to the AI research community last month.

Yandex said its public model was larger.

""YaLM 100B contains 100 billion parameters, more than any GPT-like model available in open-source under a licence that allows commercial use,"" Yandex said.

""By making YaLM 100B publicly available, we hope to give impetus to further developing generative neural networks,” said Petr Popov, CEO of Yandex Technologies.

AI technology, a key area of research and development for several major online platforms, can perpetuate humans’ societal biases around issues such as race and gender, and some researchers have concerns about the harms that can be spread through large language models.

474,META,2022-10-20,Snap's slowing ad growth sends inflation fears through tech sector,"[1/2] Snapchat app is seen on a smartphone in this illustration taken, July 13, 2021. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo















Oct 20 (Reuters) - Snap Inc (SNAP.N) on Thursday forecast no revenue growth in the typically busy holiday quarter, sending a warning signal that rising inflation and the war in Ukraine could hurt other tech companies dependent on advertising revenue.

Shares of Snap dropped 27% in after-hours trading.

The owner of photo messaging app Snapchat is the first of the major tech firms to report quarterly earnings, and the results cast a shadow for other platforms that rely on advertising revenue such as Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O) and Pinterest (PINS.N), which report their results next week.

Snap's poor results follow a similarly disappointing second quarter, in which the company painted a grim picture of the weakening economy's effect on the social media sector. Its stock was down 77% so far this year even before the latest dismal results.

Thursday's results knocked over $4 billion off Snap's market capitalization in trading after the bell.

Shares of other companies that sell digital advertising also dropped, with Meta Platforms down over 4%, Alphabet down 2.7% and Pinterest losing nearly 8%. All together the sell-off in late trading erased over $40 billion in stock market value from internet ad companies.

Social media stocks collapse

In a letter to investors, Snap said inflation caused some advertisers to reduce their marketing budgets.

""We expect that the operating environment will continue to be challenging in the months ahead,"" the company said.

The company said its internal forecast estimates that revenue for the fourth quarter, which includes the holiday season when advertisers ramp up activity, will be flat from the previous year. The ability to forecast future quarters remains challenging, Snap said.

The expectation of no growth in the fourth quarter was also a shock to investors. Wall Street had forecast 7% growth, said Brad Erickson, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, in a note after the results.

Revenue for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 was $1.13 billion, an increase of 6% from the prior-year quarter. The figure narrowly missed analyst expectations of $1.14 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Snap announced in August it would lay off 20% of all employees and discontinue projects such as gaming and a flying camera drone, in order to cut costs and steel itself against a deteriorating economy.

The Santa Monica, California-based company said it would refocus on growing its user base, diversifying its revenue sources and investing in augmented reality technologies, which overlay computerized images onto the real world.

The restructuring will help Snap ""make as much progress as possible, as quickly as possible, in the areas of our business that we are able to control,"" Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said during a conference call with analysts.

Daily active users on Snapchat rose 19% year-over-year to 363 million during the quarter.

Snap said advertising revenue has historically followed the growth and engagement of its user base, and ""we remain optimistic about our long-term opportunity.""

But as advertisers face an economic downturn, they are likely to consolidate their ad spending to fewer and stronger platforms, said Kelsey Chickering, principal analyst at Forrester.

""Unfortunately for Snapchat, their share of advertiser budgets will likely shrink further, as marketers shift into the most efficient and proven channels,"" she said.

Snap is also exposed to advertisers in categories such as mobile gaming, financial services, streaming and media, ""which seem to have pulled back their budgets,"" said Wells Fargo Securities analyst Brian Fitzgerald.

Snap said it expects Snapchat daily active users to grow to 375 million in the fourth quarter.

Adjusted earnings per share was 8 cents during the third quarter, beating analyst expectations of breakeven.

The company on Thursday also announced a share buyback program of up to $500 million.

Nov 3 (Reuters) - Roku Inc (ROKU.O) shares dropped 14% to a more than three-year low on Thursday following downbeat forecasts a day earlier, as the streaming tech provider suffers from a collapse in advertising dollars.

The company expects fourth-quarter revenue substantially below market estimates, while its adjusted operating loss outlook was much wider than Wall Street expectations. read more

""This Q4 guidance ... begs the question if Roku's management is baking in unusually high conservatism or if Roku's business mode is structurally impaired,"" analysts at Evercore ISI said.

Snap Inc (SNAP.N), Meta Platforms (META.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) have also made similar warnings in recent weeks, stoking fears that ad-reliant tech firms are set for tough times as recession-wary businesses cut spending.

""We expect these conditions to be temporary, but it is difficult to predict when they will stabilize or rebound,"" Roku Chief Executive Anthony Wood said in a letter to investors.

Roku's shares have moved lower through the year as quarterly results disappoints investors

Analysts say companies such as Roku are also lower in the advertising pecking order, particularly during an economic downturn, as they are unproven platforms and come with risks of lower returns.

""As we saw with Snap and now Roku, smaller platforms without a true upfront (advertising) mechanism are the easiest for marketers to cut, and therefore are the first to get cut,"" MoffettNathanson analysts said.

Roku shares, which have lost more than three-quarters of their value this year, were trading at $46.92.

""Roku is likely dead money over the next two quarters at least, but should rebound within the next twelve months,"" Wedbush Securities said.

476,META,2022-03-21,Telegram surpasses WhatsApp to become Russia's top messenger - Megafon,"













March 21 (Reuters) - Telegram has overtaken WhatsApp to become Russia's most popular messaging tool, the mobile operator Megafon (MFON.MM) said on Monday, with Russians flocking to the service as Moscow restricts some digital services.

WhatsApp owner Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) is embroiled in a Russian court case, with prosecutors seeking to label it an ""extremist organisation"", and authorities have actively promoted Telegram as they have banned other foreign platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter (TWTR.N). read more

Russia's military operation in Ukraine has added fuel to a simmering dispute between foreign digital platforms and Moscow.

Megafon, one of Russia's four main telecoms operators, said its analysis of mobile internet traffic showed that Telegram's share had jumped to 63% in the first two weeks of March from 48% in the first two weeks of February.

WhatsApp's share dropped to 32% from 48%, Megafon said.

The average Telegram user consumed 101 MB of data a day, compared to 26 MB for WhatsApp.

Founded by Russian Pavel Durov, Telegram has long been a popular news platform in Russia, with almost all major media, government entities and public figures operating content channels.

""The popularity of the service has grown against the backdrop of restrictions on access to other messengers and social networks,"" Megafon said in a statement. ""The service started actively growing on Feb. 24.""

Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour’s military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists.

Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.

477,META,2022-07-29,Privacy watchdogs criticise proposed EU online child pornography rules,"













BRUSSELS, July 29 (Reuters) - The European Union's privacy watchdogs on Friday criticised proposed rules to combat online child sexual abuse, saying their potential impact on individuals' privacy and personal data posed risks for fundamental rights and could harm the children they aim to protect.

Under regulations proposed by the EU's executive in May, Google, Meta and other online service providers would be required to find, remove and report online child pornography.

Companies that fail to comply with the rules would face fines up to 6% of their annual income or global turnover.

The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) and the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) said the European Commission's proposal could present more risks to individuals and society at large than to criminals pursued for child sexual abuse material.

""There can be no doubt that child sexual abuse is a most abhorrent crime that demands swift and effective action, but the proposal as it stands contains some serious shortcomings,"" EDPB Deputy Chair Ventsislav Karadjov said in a statement.

The two independent EU bodies said the proposal lacked legal certainty, endangered end-to-end encryption and could lead to detection orders that harm those they seek to protect by exposing children to monitoring or eavesdropping.

The rules would apply to hosting services and interpersonal communication services such as messaging services, app stores and internet access providers.

The European Commission said its proposal aimed to replace a system of voluntary detection and reporting by companies that had proven to be insufficient to protect children.

It cited the more than one million reports of child sexual abuse in the 27-country bloc in 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic a factor in the 64% rise in such reports in 2021 compared with the previous year. On top of that, 60% of child sexual abuse material worldwide is hosted on EU servers.

478,META,2022-05-04,Google picks former Modi think-tank official as India policy head -source,"













NEW DELHI, May 4 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google has hired a new public policy head in India, Archana Gulati, who previously worked at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's federal think-tank and the country's antitrust watchdog, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

A number of Indian government officials have been hired by Big Tech companies which are battling tighter data and privacy regulation, as well as competition law scrutiny, under Modi's federal government.

Gulati is a long-term Indian government employee, having worked until March 2021 as a joint secretary for digital communications at Modi's federal think tank, Niti Aayog, a body that is critical to government's policy making across sectors.

Before that, between 2014 and 2016, she worked as a senior official at India's antitrust body, the Competition Commission of India, according to her LinkedIn profile.

A Google India spokesperson confirmed the development to Reuters, but did not elaborate. Gulati did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The source declined to be named as the hiring decision was not public.

India's antitrust watchdog is currently looking into Google's business conduct in the market of smart TVs, its Android operating system as well as its in-app payments system.

Last year, Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) hired Rajiv Aggarwal - who spent years working in India's federal and state governments - as its head of policy.

Another former Indian antitrust and federal government official, Anand Jha, in 2019 joined Walmart (WMT.N) as India public policy officer. He currently manages government relations for Blackstone in India.

479,META,2022-10-20,"Banks, Big Tech seek clearer guidance on combating scams","













LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Banks, tech and telecom companies in Britain are calling on regulators and lawmakers to make it easier for them to share anonymised data on customers so they can spot and stop scams faster, a report published on Thursday said.

Bank fraud has cost British consumers nearly 610 million pounds ($684.36 million) so far this year, posing a national security threat, banking lobby group UK Finance said this month.

Banks have already improved defences against scams, but a report from industry body Stop Scams UK and the Royal United Services Institute on Thursday said complex guidelines and processes around privacy law make it difficult for companies to share data to stop fraud.

Britain has proposed an 'online safety bill' to deal with harmful content online, and help financial regulators crack down harder on scams.

Banks hope the bill will include clearer guidance on allowing them to share anonymised customer data - or data that does not identify the individual if refers to - to spot new types of scams more quickly.

""If we are to unlock data sharing at scale, we call for proportionate and sensible changes to guidance around the interpretation of privacy law,"" said Ruth Evans, chair of Stop Scams UK, whose members include HSBC, Lloyds, NatWest, Barclays, TalkTalk, Meta and Google.

Risk of regulatory intervention and a lack of clarity on what is allowed under the law stifles initiative, and changes in policy are needed to make it clear that sharing data is allowed and even encouraged, the report said.

Last month, more banks jointed Stop Scams UK's fraud-reporting hotline as the cost of living crisis is leading to an increase in the number of financial scams.

However, banks demanding more certainty over sharing anonymised data face opposition from privacy groups.

480,META,2023-01-05,Stellantis keeps feet on ground in air taxi punt,"













LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Pumping $150 million into a loss-making flying-car company looks like an odd use of money for a carmaker. Stellantis (STLA.MI) Chief Executive Carlos Tavares has plenty to worry about already, like a looming recession and growing competition from Chinese giants. Yet the auto group’s deal with $513 million Archer Aviation (ACHR.N) looks like a savvy bet.

Stellantis, which already owns a small stake in Archer, is acting more like a venture capitalist than a corporate raider: it has committed to buy new shares when the flying-car maker hits undisclosed milestones. At the same time, it locks in a deal to build Archer’s Midnight vehicle, which looks like a cross between a helicopter and a small plane. It’s a relatively low-risk way of getting exposure to a promising but still uncertain sector. Flying taxis may one day rule the skies, like in Ridley Scott’s film “Blade Runner”, but it’s too soon to tell whether they’ll be cheap enough for many travellers, or whether governments will bless them.

Archer too gains, mostly by piggybacking on the muscle and experience of a manufacturing giant. It also locks in secure funding at a time when public and venture capital investors are increasingly jittery. In that respect the deal could be a model for a more grounded financial era.

481,META,2022-11-14,'Big Short' fund manager Burry buys another prison stock,"













NEW YORK, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Scion Asset Management's Michael Burry, known for his timely bets against housing ahead of the 2008 financial crisis, added five new companies to his portfolio in the last quarter including prison operator CoreCivic (CXW.N), filings released on Monday showed.

The move comes after fund manager Burry dumped a dozen positions in the second quarter, including Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META.O), and replaced them with a new stake in prison company Geo Group Inc (GEO.N).

A regulatory filing on Monday showed he bought roughly 1.5 million additional shares in Geo Group in the third quarter. At current prices, Scion's position is worth $17.3 million, the biggest in his portfolio. Burry also added $7.8 million stake in CoreCivic, the filing showed.

Other names Scion added in the quarter are telecoms groups Liberty Latin America Ltd (LILA.O) and Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O), aerospace and defense company Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc (AJRD.N), and video commerce firm Qurate Retail Inc (QRTEA.O).

Shares in Geo Group, CoreCivic and Aerojet are up year-to-date, outperforming the S&P 500, which is down 16.3% on the year. Liberty and Qurate are down 28.5% and 76% on the year respectively.

Filings known as 13-f are one of the few quarterly disclosures that hedge fund managers make of their long positions - bets that a stock will rise - and may not reflect current holdings.

Fund managers are not required to disclose short positions, which profit when a company's shares fall.

482,META,2022-03-31,Social media interoperability project Bluesky names first employees,"













March 31 (Reuters) - Bluesky, a company funded by Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) to develop a new operating standard for social media, on Thursday will name its first three employees, more than two years after Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey first announced the initiative, according to a blog post seen by Reuters.

Bluesky is working to build an open protocol for social media with the aim of enabling different social platforms to operate together, which would represent a fundamental shift from today's social media landscape.

The internet is currently dominated by walled-off tech giants like Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Meta Platforms Inc's (FB.O) Facebook, which function unilaterally. But in a future world of decentralized social media platforms, a Twitter user could send a message to a person on Reddit, for instance.

Dorsey, who joined Bluesky's board in February, has said the vision could take years to come to fruition. Social media users would have greater control over the types of content they see in their feeds, and they could also take their data and easily switch to a different social media app. read more

Aaron Goldman, who previously worked at Twitter and Google, will join Bluesky as a security engineer, according to the company blog post, which was to be published later on Thursday.

Daniel Holmgren and Paul Frazee will join as protocol engineers. Holmgren previously co-founded a tech startup, and Frazee previously built a web browser called Beaker.

With the initial team assembled, the company will be able to build its first prototype with engagement from other technologists in the industry, Bluesky Chief Executive Officer Jay Graber wrote in the blog post.

483,META,2022-04-20,Netflix selloff is latest in Wall St retreat from streaming,"[1/2] A Wall Street sign is pictured outside the New York Stock Exchange amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., April 16, 2021. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri















April 20 (Reuters) - The collapse of Netflix's (NFLX.O) stock on Wednesday after the company reported its first loss of customers in a decade is the latest drastic sign that Wall Street is abandoning streaming services and other pandemic winners and questioning whether they still merit growth stock valuations.

With Netflix shares tumbling 37% after the entertainment heavyweight's disastrous quarterly report late on Tuesday, its stock market value has now fallen by two thirds from its peak of over $300 billion late last year. read more

Netflix's market capitalization now stands at about $100 billion, by far the smallest among the so-called FAANG group of stocks - which also includes Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (FB.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) - that fueled much of Wall Street's rally in the years prior to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.

Facebook-owner Meta Platforms, the next least valuable FAANG company, was worth about $550 billion on Wednesday, with its stock dropping about 7% as investors dumped a range of former stay-at-home winners in the wake of Netflix's report.

Netflix struggles as FANG loses bite

Portfolio managers who focus on high-growth stocks with pricey valuations may reflexively snap up Netflix' deeply discounted shares following Wednesday's selloff, putting aside the company's increasingly difficult challenges with market saturation, password sharing and uncertainty in markets such as Ukraine and Russia, predicted Jim Bianco, president of financial market research firm Bianco Research in Chicago.

""I think it's going to take some time for them to start to recognize whether or not Disney and Roku (ROKU.O) and Netflix and Hulu and Paramount might not be growth companies any more, that they might have hit their saturation point,"" Bianco said.

Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics

Netflix's poor report and stock selloff impacted other streaming-related stocks: Walt Disney (DIS.N) fell 5.8%, Paramount Global (PARA.O)dropped 8.1%, Warner Bros Discovery (WBD.O) fell 5.2% and Roku lost 5.8%.

Walt Disney's video steaming service pushed Disney's stock higher immediately after it was unveiled in 2019 and helped the theme park operator weather pandemic-related shutdowns. However, after peaking a year ago, Disney's stock has steadily lost ground and it is now trading at levels below when Disney+ was unveiled.

Reuters Graphics

Disney's venture into video streaming lifted its forward price/earnings valuation to levels similar to Netflix's in 2020, with Disney's PE briefly reaching as much as 72 at a time when Netflix was valued at 58 times earnings, according to Refinitiv data. But both companies' PEs have since fallen in tandem, reflecting tougher competition as more streaming services entered the market and the increasing financial burden of producing top tier content to attract and keep customers.

Streaming valuations

Other companies that benefited during the pandemic have also given up more of their gains in recent months as consumers venture out of their homes and shift their spending habits. Peloton Interactive (PTON.O), Zoom Video Communications (ZM.O) and Pinterest (PINS.N) have all tumbled in recent months and are now down more than 60% over the past 12 months.

Reuters Graphics

While competition is growing across the streaming industry, Truist analyst Matthew Thornton believes Netflix is the most vulnerable because it is the largest and most well-established.

""They'll feel it more than an emerging challenger,"" Thornton said.

While Disney has also been hurt by pulling out of Russia because of the war in Ukraine, Thornton said the impact has already been well telegraphed to investors.

Analysts on average expect Disney to report a 29% year over year jump in revenue to $20.1 billion when it provides its quarterly results on May 11, according to Refinitiv. Analysts expect it to report a March-quarter net profit of $1.8 billion, almost double from a year ago.

(Reuters) - Cravath, Swaine & Moore said Monday that Noah Phillips, who stepped down from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission last week, will join the Wall Street law firm as a partner.

The former FTC commissioner joins Cravath's new Washington, D.C. office as co-chair of the firm's antitrust practice.

Phillips, a Republican who was appointed to the role in 2018 by President Donald Trump, announced in August his intent to resign this fall.

He previously served as chief counsel for Republican U.S. Senator John Cornyn. He also practiced at Cravath earlier in his career.

The 200-year-old firm said in June it would open the Washington office with a trio of former government regulator hires, including former Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation chairman Jelena McWilliams, former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission commissioner Elad Roisman and former SEC enforcement official Jennifer Leete.

Cravath has secured a 21,065-square-foot lease in downtown Washington, according to a statement last week from Stream Realty Partners, which said it represented the building's owners in the deal.

Phillips will lead the antitrust practice alongside Christine Varney, a former FTC Commissioner and U.S. assistant attorney general for antitrust matters.

""Noah has served as an FTC Commissioner during a very dynamic period for antitrust enforcement and rulemaking,"" Cravath presiding partner Faiza Saeed said in a statement, calling his experience ""invaluable"" to the firm's clients.

Phillips dissented in several antitrust actions filed against social media companies, including in December 2020 in an FTC antitrust case filed against Facebook, now known as Meta Platforms.

Summary Companies

Companies Law firms Judicial panel determining multidistrict litigation will weigh lawsuits alleging link between acetaminophen and autism

Will also consider cases claiming Meta Platforms' apps are intentionally designed to foster addiction

Two proposed environmental MDLs face strong opposition















(Reuters) - The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation will meet today in St. Louis to consider creating nationwide MDLs for three fast-growing areas of product-liability litigation: social media addiction lawsuits, primarily against Facebook and Instagram’s parent Meta Platforms Inc; claims that acetaminophen use during pregnancy increases the child’s risk of autism-spectrum disorders and ADHD; and cases spurred by Exactech Inc’s recent recalls of many of its knee, ankle and hip-replacement products.

The panel also will consider two highly contested petitions in environmental cases: one by the U.S. Postal Service, which is battling blue states, green groups and the United Auto Workers over its decision to stick with mostly gas-powered delivery vehicles; the other filed by the Klamath Irrigation District to consolidate seven lawsuits over water use in the drought-stricken district.

MDL No. 3043 − IN RE: ACETAMINOPHEN − ASD/ADHD PRODUCTS LIABILITY LITIGATIONDozens of lawsuits have been filed in the past year, quoting recent studies that link pregnant women’s use of acetaminophen to an increased risk of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and ADHD in their children. In June, plaintiff Aujenai Thompson sought to consolidate 19 actions against the sellers of “store-brand” acetaminophen products for pretrial coordination or consolidation. Since then, more than 30 related actions have been filed, naming Costco Wholesale Corp, CVS Pharmacy Inc, Rite Aid Corp, Safeway, Target Corp, Walgreen Co and Walmart Inc as defendants.

Thompson alleges that the retailers failed to warn pregnant users of their store-brand acetaminophen products about the neurological risks to the fetus. The motion proposes consolidation before any “capable transferee judge” selected by the JPML.

All the defendants oppose consolidation, saying the manufacturers of Tylenol and the generic store-brand equivalents are “conspicuously missing” from any actions in the proposed MDL and are necessary parties.

The defendants also argue that their products are safe and properly labeled under federal law; and that an MDL would be inefficient because the plaintiffs’ alleged injuries are “highly plaintiff-specific,” both as to cause and effects.

Several of the retailers also oppose an “industry-wide” MDL — in which competing companies would be lumped together as defendants — although Target and Walmart say a retailer-specific MDL might be an option.

MDL No. 3047 − IN RE: SOCIAL MEDIA ADOLESCENT ADDICTION/PERSONAL INJURY PRODUCTS LIABILITY LITIGATION

The JPML will consider pretrial consolidation for about 75 lawsuits alleging that social media hubs are intentionally designed to foster addiction, which causes mental health problems for children, and that the companies “fail to warn minor users and their parents about the risks posed by the products.”

Facebook, Instagram and parent company Meta Platforms are defendants in nearly all the lawsuits. Many also name Snap Inc’s Snapchat, ByteDance Ltd’s TikTok, or Alphabet Inc’s YouTube. All the actions were filed after former Facebook employee Frances Haugen testified before Congress last fall, saying “internal Meta documents show that Defendants were aware of the harm its products cause users, especially female children and adolescents,” an attorney for plaintiff Brianna Murden wrote in the motion for consolidation.

Murden, 21, started using Facebook and Instagram at age 10 and developed “social media compulsion, disordered eating, depression, body dysmorphic disorder, multiple periods of suicidal ideation, severe anxiety,” and other injuries as a result, the Aug. 1 motion says. The 27 other lawsuits filed at that point assert “nearly identical factual allegations and legal claims,” her attorney wrote.

Murden suggests assigning the MDL to U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis in Chicago or U.S. District Court Judge Stephen Bough, based on their judicial experience, their courts’ central locations, and their fast resolution of pending cases.

Meta supports consolidation of all cases — including those against Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube — as the fastest way to resolve “cross-cutting” issues, including defenses to liability under the Communications Decency Act and the Free Speech clause of the 1st Amendment. However, it says the MDL should be assigned to a less-busy court – specifically, either of Kentucky’s federal districts, the Middle District of Florida or the Northern District of Georgia.

Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube oppose consolidation, saying their services have little in common with Facebook or Instagram. A “behemoth, industry-wide MDL involving all ‘social media’ platforms” also would be “far too broad, and the weight of such an MDL would crush our federal judiciary,” TikTok’s opposition brief says.

MDL No. 3044 − IN RE: EXACTECH POLYETHYLENE ORTHOPEDIC PRODUCTS LIABILITY LITIGATION

A group of plaintiffs whose knee, ankle or hip implants failed prematurely, requiring further surgery, asked the JPML in June to consolidate 27 pending cases against the manufacturer, Exactech Inc. As of Tuesday, the number of cases had grown to 73 – and the plaintiffs expect it will go higher, since Exactech has recalled about 200,000 polyethylene knee, ankle and hip devices since August 2021.

According to Exactech’s response, it initiated the recalls after finding a few instances of premature wear in Optetrak knee-replacement components that were stored for about five years before being implanted.

The company concluded that “off-specification” packaging was to blame, and that it might not protect the device’s polyethylene components against oxidation for their full eight-year shelf life. The plaintiffs allege that the products also may suffer from design defects.

In addition to Optetrak, the recalled products include several years’ models of Optetrak Logic and Truliant knee replacement systems, Exactech Vantage ankle devices, the Connexion GXL acetabular liner and seven other polyethylene hip liners.

The plaintiffs’ motion for consolidation asks the JPML to assign the cases to U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in the Eastern District of New York, noting that Exactech developed the Optetrak device at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Brooklyn, and that it “was likely implanted in more New York area residents than anywhere else.”

Exactech supports consolidation, but says the cases should be assigned to U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan or U.S. District Judge Sarah Vance in New Orleans, based on their prior experience overseeing medical-products MDLs.

MDL No. 3046 − IN RE: U.S. POSTAL SERVICE'S NEXT GENERATION DELIVERY VEHICLE ACQUISITIONS PROGRAM RECORD OF DECISION LITIGATION

The U.S. Postal Service has asked the JPML to consolidate three actions challenging its decision to stick primarily to gasoline-powered trucks as it replaces its existing delivery vehicles, which make up about a third of the federal government’s fleet.

USPS in March finalized a decision to purchase up to 165,000 vehicles over the next 10 years, with at least 10% electric vehicles (EVs). It then placed an initial $2.98 billion order for 50,000 vehicles, including 10,000 EVs.

California and 15 other states, plus the District of Columbia and New York City, sued to block the plan in federal court in San Francisco on April 28. So did CleanAirNow, the Center for Biological Diversity and the Sierra Club. The Natural Resources Defense Council and the United Auto Workers jointly filed the third action in federal court in New York.

The lawsuits accuse USPS of using a flawed and unlawful environmental analysis and signing contracts before it had completed a draft environmental review.

USPS wants the suits consolidated in federal court in Washington, D.C., primarily to avoid inconsistent decisions that could “severely disrupt” implementation of its 10-year plan.

In particular, USPS wants a single judge to put all three lawsuits on hold while it drafts a supplemental environmental impact statement to reflect its shift to a more hub-based system of routes. USPS expects the change, which it announced in May, to increase the usefulness of EVs and make it easier to keep them charged, resulting in substantially more EV purchases.

However, USPS has not withdrawn the existing 10-year acquisition program, the challengers note. They oppose creation of an MDL, saying it is unnecessary for three lawsuits – two of which are proceeding before the same magistrate judge – and all of which will be based on the administrative record, leaving little if any need for additional discovery or other pretrial procedures.

MDL No. 3048 − IN RE: KLAMATH RIVER BASIN LITIGATION

The Klamath Irrigation District (KID) in Oregon is seeking partners in its ongoing litigation against the U.S. Interior Department’s Bureau of Reclamation, over competing water rights in the drought-stricken Klamath River Basin between Southern Oregon and Northern California.

KID’s lawsuit accuses the federal agency of releasing state-owned water from Upper Klamath Lake into the Klamath River, to protect coho salmon and two kinds of sucker fish. The Bureau argues that it had a superior right to do so under the Endangered Species Act.

KID is seeking MDL treatment for six other lawsuits over Upper Klamath Lake’s water rights, based on state laws, contracts, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the U.S. Constitution, commercial fishing rights and the Yurok and Klamath Tribes’ rights to use the river for subsistence, cultural, religious, and commercial purposes.

“(I)t will be far easier, and more convenient, to reach a global resolution of these interrelated claims if all parties are forced to litigate in a single, neutral forum,” KID’s attorneys wrote in the motion for consolidation.

To ensure neutrality, KID suggests assigning the MDL to Chief U.S. District Judge William Johnson of New Mexico or to U.S. District Judge Roger Jones of Nevada, both of whom have experience dealing with comprehensive water-rights litigation.

The Bureau and most of the other parties oppose consolidation, saying the cases are too few in number, too different from each other, and too far advanced to benefit from an MDL. Five of the seven actions are expected to be resolved soon, the opponents said.

They also object to litigating in New Mexico or Nevada, before “entirely new districts and new judges – hundreds of miles away from the geographic locus of the dispute, the evidence, and any witnesses – who would require significant time to come up to speed on the issues presented,” the Bureau’s opposition brief said.

Summary Law firms Tech litigator Lauren Goldman joins Gibson Dunn as a partner

Her clients have included Facebook, Shutterfly















(Reuters) - Law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher has hired Lauren Goldman, a New York-based partner who leaves her role as a leader of Mayer Brown's Supreme Court and appellate group, the firm said on Monday.

Goldman, a longtime Mayer Brown litigator, focuses on technology and data privacy issues, according to Los Angeles-founded Gibson Dunn.

She was part of a team that represented Facebook, now Meta Platforms Inc, in biometric privacy litigation over its facial recognition technology, according to court documents. Facebook settled for $650 million and did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to the 2020 settlement.

Goldman recently represented Shutterfly Inc in a facial recognition biometric privacy lawsuit, which settled for $6.75 million last year, court filings said. The digital imaging company denied wrongdoing.

She also was on the team that helped notch a jury trial win for Palmer Luckey, the founder of Facebook Inc's virtual reality unit Oculus VR, in an IP case last fall.

A Mayer Brown spokesperson said the firm wishes Goldman well.

Mayer Brown's Supreme Court and appellate practice is co-headed by Nicole Saharsky, former assistant to the U.S. solicitor general. Andrew Pincus, who previously held the same position, and served as general counsel of the U.S. Department of Commerce, is also part of the team.

Gibson Dunn, which has about 1,600 lawyers globally, has in the past few months hired several other partners who focus on technology and privacy matters.

The firm recruited another Mayer Brown partner, former Apple Inc attorney Vivek Mohan, to co-chair its artificial intelligence and automated systems practice in June.

Express Mobile has sued dozens of companies over same patents















(Reuters) - E-commerce platform Shopify Inc owes patent holder Express Mobile Inc $40 million for infringing three patents related to mobile-website technology, a Delaware jury said in a verdict made public Thursday.

The federal jury on Wednesday awarded Express Mobile a lump sum and rejected Shopify's argument that the patents are invalid. Express Mobile has sued dozens of tech companies for allegedly infringing the same and other patents, including in ongoing cases against Google, Meta and Amazon.

A Shopify spokesperson said Thursday that the company was ""disappointed and surprised"" by the verdict but is confident that it does not infringe and ""intends to pursue the matter in the district court or, if necessary, on appeal.""

Express Mobile attorney Jay Nuttall of Steptoe & Johnson said Thursday that the verdict showed the company's technology is ""an important and valuable improvement that was being used by Shopify.""

Express Mobile owns patents related to internet and mobile technology developed by the company's founder, former IBM engineer Steven Rempell. The company argued that Shopify's website-building tools infringed its patents, which relate to software for providing content to mobile devices.

It sued Shopify in 2019 after Shopify asked the Delaware court for a declaration that it did not infringe.

The case is Shopify Inc v. Express Mobile Inc, U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, No. 1:19-cv-00439.

488,META,2023-01-24,Alphabet-owned AI firm DeepMind shutters office in Canada's Edmonton,"













Jan 24 (Reuters) - DeepMind Technologies, owned by Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), is closing its office in the Canadian city of Edmonton, a spokesperson for the AI firm said, just days after Google's parent announced it would lay off 12,000 employees.

London-based DeepMind's Edmonton office is the only international site directly managed by the artificial intelligence firm, making it far more resource-intensive to operate, the spokesperson said. All other DeepMind sites are housed within Google-managed offices.

Alphabet's layoffs follow thousands of layoffs at tech giants including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), which are cutting costs and downsizing after a pandemic-led hiring spree left them flabby in a weak economy.

Researchers have been offered the option to relocate to another DeepMind office, such as DeepMind Montreal, based in Google’s Montreal office, the spokesperson added.

Google acquired DeepMind in 2014, putting the tech giant ahead in the AI race than most of its peers. But competition escalated after Microsoft-backed OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT boosted investor interest in the promise of generative artificial intelligence.

""I am confident about the huge opportunity in front of us thanks to the strength of our mission, the value of our products and services, and our early investments in AI,"" Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said in the blog post on Jan. 20.

BRUSSELS, March 31 (Reuters) - Regulators are looking to update rules, which target companies abusing their market power and those setting up illegal cartels, to make them more efficient, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Thursday.

Under the rules, known as Regulation 1/2003 and in force since 2004, the European Commission has taken on Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta (FB.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Intel (INTC.O) and imposed billions of euros in fines.

The rules have also allowed the EU competition enforcer to go after car parts cartels, banks' manipulation of financial benchmarks and other illegal price-fixing groups, putting the EU agency in the forefront of antitrust enforcement.

The Commission wants to maintain its leading position, Vestager said.

""I'm announcing today that in the coming months we are going to launch an evaluation of Regulation 1/2003, the central plank of our antitrust enforcement framework,"" Vestager told a conference organised by economic consultancy CRA.

""It is important that we hear the views of stakeholders concerning what has worked well, and where there is scope for more efficient and effective procedures and enforcement tools; making sure Regulation 1 is truly 'fit for the digital age',"" she said.

Vestager said the updated rules would seek to make them more operational and useful to businesses.

Such procedural changes would relate to requests for information sent to companies, dawn raids, oral hearings where companies seek to defend their cases and the 10% cap on fines levied for breach of rules or non-compliance.

JAKARTA, July 21 (Reuters) - Indonesia said on Thursday Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google has signed up to its new licensing rules for technology platforms, but warned that companies that had yet to register would be blocked in five working days.

Semuel Abrijani Pangerapan of the communications ministry told a news conference that Amazon and Alibaba were among the companies that had yet to comply.

Representatives for Amazon and Alibaba were not immediately available for comment.

Registration is required under rules released in late November 2020 and will give authorities broad powers to compel platforms to disclose data of certain users and take down content deemed unlawful or that ""disturbs public order"" within four hours if urgent, and 24 hours if not.

The government had set a Wednesday deadline for companies to sign up and most had done so earlier this week. read more

The new rules are intended to ensure a positive online environment, the government has said, but activists and civil society groups say the regulations are among the most repressive in the region and pose a threat to freedom of expression.

Google was among the last tech giants to agree to the rules, with Twitter (TWTR.N) and Zoom Video Communication (ZM.O) added to a communications ministry list of foreign providers on Wednesday, joining Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) units Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, which registered a day earlier.

With an estimated 191 million internet users and a young, social-media savvy population, the Southeast Asian nation is a significant market for a host of tech platforms.

LUXEMBOURG, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Google suffered one of its biggest setbacks on Wednesday after Europe's second-top court upheld an EU antitrust decision against the Alphabet (GOOGL.O) company for using its Android mobile operating system to thwart rivals.

The company however had its fine reduced to 4.125 billion euros ($4.13 billion) from 4.34 billion after judges used a different reasoning from the European Commission. The amount is still a record for an antitrust violation. read more

The EU antitrust enforcer has imposed a total of 8.25 billion euros in antitrust fines on the world's most popular internet search engine in three investigations stretching back more than a decade.

Here is a timeline of Google's fight with the EU competition watchdog over its business practices, which have triggered numerous complaints by rivals on both sides of the Atlantic as well as consumer groups.

* June 9 2021 - Google bows to pressure from rivals and will let them compete for free to be the default search engines on Android devices in Europe, widening a pledge to EU antitrust regulators two years previously.

* March 20 2019 - EU antitrust enforcers hit Google with a 1.49 billion euro fine for hindering rivals in online search advertising for a decade.

* July 18 2018 - EU antitrust regulators hand down a record 4.34 billion euro fine to Google over its Android mobile operating system after a three-year investigation.

* June 27 2017 - EU fines Google 2.42 billion euros for thwarting rival shopping comparison websites.

DUBLIN, July 27 (Reuters) - The Irish government on Wednesday said it will appoint two additional commissioners to Ireland's Data Protection Commission, lead regulator in Europe for tech giants Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, Meta Platforms (META.O) unit Facebook, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N)).

Minister for Justice Helen McEntee said the appointments will support existing commissioner Helen Dixon and improve the commission's ability to handle an increased workload and increasingly complex investigative requirements.

Ireland regulates a number of large U.S. internet giants because their European Union headquarters are in the country, but its DPC has been criticised for long, plodding investigations into big tech multinationals. Pressure has been building for a pan-European approach to data and privacy protection.

Dixon's office has so far completed three investigations of multinationals under new EU privacy rules introduced in 2018, including hitting WhatsApp with a 225 million euro fine last year.

Speaking to Reuters in February, Dixon said staffing at the regulator has increased to 195 from 27 in 2014 and the numbers needed to be increased more. However, she dismissed calls for another two commissioners to be appointed to speed up the processing of the backlog in cases.

""We don't think a three-headed organisation will improve some of the issues that we have talked about in terms of perception of speed,"" she said.

Last month, the head of the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), Wojciech Wiewiorowski, called for a pan-European data protection enforcement model to ensure consistent high-level protection of fundamental rights to data protection and privacy across the European Union. read more

LONDON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - VK (VKCOq.L), owner of Russian social network VKontakte, reported a second-quarter net loss of 3.4 billion roubles ($56 million) on Thursday, partly due to a 14 billion rouble ($231 million) foreign exchange hit.

The VKontakte network, often compared to Facebook, has emerged as a key player in the race to replace Western services in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and blocks imposed by Moscow since then on Western social media platforms. read more

VK's second quarter result was adjusted from a 3.6 billion rouble profit after volatility in the rouble, which recovered from a record low in March to a near seven-year peak in June.

The company said that total adjusted EBITDA had fallen 37% year on year to 4.2 billion roubles ($69 million).

Russia is pushing for the rapid development of domestic digital alternatives and has accelerated efforts to exert control since launching the war on Ukraine on Feb. 24. The Kremlin has blocked access to Twitter (TWTR.N), Facebook and Instagram, and found Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) guilty of “extremist activities”.

A shareholder and management shake-up saw Gazprom Media acquire a chunk of VK's voting rights in December, adding to a growing media empire controlled by the state energy giant.

Yandex said in late April it was selling its news aggregator platform Yandex News and content recommendation service Yandex Zen to VK, but did not disclose terms. read more

REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo















Dec 1 (Reuters) - Shares of Salesforce Inc (CRM.N) fell about 10% on Thursday after co-CEO Bret Taylor's sudden exit caught Wall Street off guard and raised concerns about the merit in having two leaders.

His departure after just a year in the role coincides with slowing revenue growth at the software company as it faces stiff competition from the likes of Microsoft (MSFT.O), a stronger dollar and businesses cutting spending amid red-hot inflation.

At least 17 brokerages slashed their price targets on the stock, with the steepest cut coming from J.P. Morgan analysts who lowered their target by $45 to $200.

Jefferies analysts said the surprise exit indicated that the ""co-CEO model is not working with two departures in three years.""

Taylor, a tech veteran who has worked at Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META.O) as technology chief and served as Twitter Inc's chairman, departs San Francisco-based Salesforce after six years, leaving co-founder Marc Benioff as top boss.

Benioff tapped Taylor as co-CEO in 2021, to replace Oracle (ORCL.N) executive Keith Block who stepped down from the role just before the pandemic began.

Taylor was involved with Salesforce's software which helps businesses effectively manage customer interaction, and was a key driving force behind the company's $27.7 billion takeover of workspace messaging platform Slack Technologies.

He was previously chief operating officer and chief product officer of the company.

""We view this leadership change as a significant blow given his leadership role on product,"" Needham analysts said in a note.

Shares of the company, which have lost about 37% so far this year, ended 5.7% higher on Wednesday before Salesforce's third-quarter earnings report.

May 23 (Reuters) - Snap Inc (SNAP.N)said the economy had worsened faster than expected in the last month and the social media company slashed its quarterly forecast, triggering an after-hours sell-off.

Since late April, ""the macroeconomic environment has deteriorated further and faster than anticipated. As a result, we believe it is likely that we will report revenue and adjusted EBITDA below the low end of our Q2 2022 guidance range,"" the company said in a U.S. securities filing.

Shares of Snap fell 31%, Alphabet dropped 3.6% and Amazon dropped 2.2%. Nasdaq futures also fell, with traders blaming Snap. read more

U.S. stocks had ended higher on Monday, led by gains from banks and tech, but the rise follows Wall Street's longest streak of weekly declines since the dotcom bust more than 20 years ago and many investors remain on edge. read more

Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel told employees in a memo seen by Reuters that the company will slow hiring for this year and laid out a broad slate of problems.

""Like many companies, we continue to face rising inflation and interest rates, supply chain shortages and labor disruptions, platform policy changes, the impact of the war in Ukraine, and more,"" he wrote.

Last month, Snap forecast second-quarter revenue growth of 20% to 25% over the previous year. read more

The news follows statements by companies including Uber Technologies Inc and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc earlier this month that they would rein in costs and hiring.

In the memo, Spiegel said Snap would evaluate the rest of this year's budget and ""leaders have been asked to review spending to find additional cost savings.""

Some planned hiring will be pushed into next year, though the company still expects to hire more than 500 people by the end of this year, he said.

496,META,2022-04-21,"Snap warns inflation could hit revenue growth, forecasts higher users","













April 21 (Reuters) - Snap Inc (SNAP.N) on Thursday forecast a rosy outlook for user growth on its Snapchat app, but said supply-chain disruptions and inflation could continue to hurt advertising demand.

Shares of Snap fell as much as 10% immediately after the results, but pared losses later on as investors digested the mixed results.

Snap forecast second-quarter daily active users at between 343 million and 345 million, above Wall Street estimates of 340 million.

However, the company warned that inflation, labor shortages and other economic challenges could pressure revenue. It forecast second-quarter revenue growth between 20% and 25% over the previous year. The growth rate so far in the current quarter has been 30%.

The Santa Monica, California-based company is the first of the major tech apps to report first-quarter earnings, and the results could cast a shadow over Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), which also earn revenue by selling digital advertising and will report results next week.

A large number of advertisers paused their ad campaigns in the days following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February, said Snap Chief Financial Officer Derek Andersen, in prepared remarks released before an earnings call with analysts.

While the majority of advertisers resumed their campaigns, many remained concerned about inflation and continuing geopolitical risk, he said.

Revenue for the first quarter ended March 31 was $1.06 billion, an increase of 38% from the prior-year quarter. The figure missed analyst expectations of $1.07 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

497,META,2022-08-15,Snap reaches 1 mln premium subscribers in bid for new revenue,"













Aug 15 (Reuters) - Snap Inc (SNAP.N), parent company of social media app Snapchat, has reached 1 million subscribers for its Snapchat+ premium subscription, the company said on Monday, afterlaunching the service in June as a new source of revenue.

Social media companies including Snap, Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), which all earn the majority of revenue from selling digital advertising, are facing a weakening ad market due to record-high inflation causing brands to reign in their marketing spending.

Snap's shares dropped 25% last month after disappointing second quarter earnings, as it suffered from weaker advertising demand than Wall Street had expected. Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said the company would work to speed up revenue growth, in part through new sources of revenue. read more

Snapchat+, which costs $3.99 per month in the United States, offers access to 11 exclusive features not yet available to general users. Four new features announced Monday include new Snapchat app icon designs and the ability for subscribers to have their messages be more visible to celebrities on Snapchat. Subscribers can also use Snapchat on desktops.

The paid subscription feature is now expanding to more countries including Saudi Arabia, India and Egypt, for a total of 25 markets, Snap said.

Twitter, which is in a legal battle with billionaire Elon Musk over his attempt to walk away from his $44-billion deal to buy the company, also previously launched a $4.99 per month subscription product called Twitter Blue. Facebook and Instagram do not offer paid subscriptions as of now.

498,META,2022-07-14,Twitter back up after global outage,"













July 14 (Reuters) - Twitter (TWTR.N) said its service was back online following a major outage on Thursday that kept thousands of users across the globe from accessing the social media platform.

The near three-hour outage affected as many as 50,000 users at its peak at around 8:15 am ET, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com.

The incident comes days after Twitter sued Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk for violating his deal to buy the company and asked a Delaware court to order the world's richest person to complete the takeover. read more

""We had some trouble with our internal systems that impacted many of you globally. Twitter should be up and running as expected,"" the social media company said in a tweet.

Twitter is hosted on Amazon Web Services and also uses Google Cloud as its secondary vendor, Wells Fargo Securities analyst Brian Fitzgerald said.

The analyst ruled out a problem at cloud vendors as a reason for the disruption.

Twitter had suffered another widespread outage in February that it blamed on a software glitch. read more

Other big technology companies have also been hit by outages in the past year, with a near six-hour disruption at Meta Platforms (META.O)keeping WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger out of reach for billions of users in October. read more

Notorious for outages in its early years, Twitter was known for using its popular ""Fail Whale"" illustration, which showed a beluga whale being lifted by birds, during such incidents.

Twitter shares were down about 1% at $36.42 on Thursday.

499,META,2023-03-16,"U.S. FTC asks social media, video streaming firms info on misleading ads","













March 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Thursday issued orders to eight social media and video streaming firms including Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Twitter, TikTok and YouTube seeking information on how the platforms screen for misleading advertisements.

Snap (SNAP.N), Amazon.com Inc-owned (AMZN.O) Twitch, Pinterest (PINS.N) and Instagram are the other companies which are all required to provide information such as ad revenue and number of views including those in categories of products and services more prone to deception.

YouTube said it has a strict advertising policy that it enforces vigorously, adding it was reviewing the FTC letter and would work to provide the agency a full response. Snap said it would also respond to the FTC.

The other companies did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

The regulator is seeking to scrutinize and restrict paid commercial advertising that is deceptive or exposes consumers to fraudulent healthcare products, financial scams, counterfeit and fake goods, or other fraud.

""Social media has been a gold mine for scammers who tout sham products and other scams that have cost consumers enormously in recent years,"" said Samuel Levine, director of the FTC's consumer protection bureau.

""This study will help the FTC ensure that social media and video streaming companies are doing everything they can to keep scammers and deceptive ads off their platforms.""

The order comes after the FTC asked Twitter to turn over some internal communications related to owner Elon Musk and other detailed information about business decisions as part of an investigation earlier this month. read more

500,META,2023-02-22,Amazon delivers a regulatory breather to Big Tech,"













WASHINGTON, Feb 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Trustbusters may have finally discovered their eyes are bigger than their stomachs. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said it won’t challenge Amazon.com’s (AMZN.O) $3.9 billion acquisition of physician network One Medical. As the deal moves forward, deal-hungry technology giants can take a small breather.

Wednesday’s decision stands out because the FTC has so been so aggressive under Chair Lina Khan. Among other initiatives, the agency has sued Microsoft (MSFT.O) for its planned $69 billion takeover of video-game developer Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) and lost its case trying to stop Meta Platforms (META.O) from buying virtual reality app maker Within Unlimited. Amazon’s purchase of Roomba-maker iRobot (IRBT.O) remains under scrutiny.

The agency may be picking its battles more carefully, however. One Medical’s revenue accounted for just 0.2% of all U.S. healthcare spending in 2021, according to Amazon. Its own presence in the market is even smaller. Proving the deal was anticompetitive would have been tough.

And while the FTC’s concerns about Big Tech seemed limitless, its resources aren’t. Letting the One Medical deal move forward frees up staff to focus on ones that pose a clearer threat to consumers. Only some acquirers can rest easier. (By Ben Winck)

501,META,2023-01-05,Amazon: it’s just like them,"













NEW YORK, Jan 5 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Amazon.com (AMZN.O) can’t always dominate everything – and that might be a strength. The $855 billion e-commerce giant is laying off 18,000 people, more than it had originally planned. In a backwards way, this helps Amazon’s antitrust defense.

Boss Andy Jassy wrote in a memo Wednesday about plans to hand out pink slips mostly in the Amazon Stores and People, Experience, and Technology groups. Like other digital behemoths, Amazon has been hit by a slowing economy and investors’ souring view on tech. Last year’s revenue is likely to have ended up just 9% higher than 2021, according to Refinitiv estimates, compared to 22% growth in 2021 versus the previous year.

The irony is that showing weakness could actually benefit Amazon. Jassy said the company was going to be “scrappy in this time”. That sounds like something a smaller technology shop might say. With a market capitalization of more than two Walmarts (WMT.N) and revenue of five Targets (TGT.N), it’s hardly small. But showing that it has to work to compete in a difficult environment probably isn’t a terrible strategy for a company facing antitrust blowback. (By Lauren Silva Laughlin)

Nov 16 (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) raised its full-year revenue and profit forecast amid easing supply chain hurdles and announced $600 million in severance and other charges related to a new restructuring, which could impact roughly 5% of its workforce.

Shares of the company rose nearly 5% in extended trading on Wednesday.

The company said the restructuring plan will begin in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023.

""This is not about reducing our workforce - in fact we will have roughly the same number of employees at the end of this fiscal year as we had when we started,"" Cisco said, adding it would focus its resources on its enterprise networking and security businesses.

The restructuring comes at a time when most companies including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Facebook's parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) are making deep cuts to their employee base to navigate a potential downturn in the economy.

Cisco said it would book the charges over the next few quarters, which included some costs related to downsizing its office space as more people work in a hybrid home-and-office model.

The company will talk to its employees on Thursday about the restructuring plan, Chief Executive Chuck Robbins said in a post-earnings call.

Cisco's revenue was $13.63 billion in the first quarter, above analysts' estimates of $13.31 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Easing supply chain snags and Cisco's recent investments in cloud offerings and targeted price hikes have helped the company improve its business and attract customers amid an economic slowdown.

Cisco said it expects an annual revenue growth of 4.5% to 6.5%, and adjusted earnings between $3.51 and $3.58. It previously forecast revenue growth of 4% to 6% for the year and earnings of $3.49 to $3.56, excluding items.

Excluding items, Cisco earned 86 cents per share, 2 cents above expectation.

503,META,2022-08-11,"Australian crypto ownership warrants consumer protection, says regulator","













SYDNEY, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Nearly half of Australian retail investors owned cryptocurrency in late 2021 and more got their information from YouTube videos than from financial advisers, the securities watchdog said on Thursday, calling the data a ""strong case for regulation"".

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) survey of 1,053 retail investors, conducted last November, found 44% reported holding cryptocurrency, making it the second most popular investment after Australian shares.

A quarter of the investors surveyed who held cryptocurrency said it was their only investment.

The data will add to pressure on Australia's new Labor government to emphasise consumer protection as it takes over a years-long study, started under the previous conservative government, on whether and how to regulate the digital assets.

It also legitimises widely circulated statistics about high rates of Australian cryptocurrency ownership which last year were dismissed as ""implausible"" by a top central bank official.

The survey also showed 41% of respondents went to a social media outlet for investment information, with 20% naming Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Youtube and 11% naming Meta Platforms' Facebook.

Just 13% gained their information from a financial adviser or broker, according to the survey.

""We are concerned about the number of people surveyed who reported investing in unregulated, volatile crypto-asset products,"" ASIC Chair Joe Longo said in a statement.

""There are limited protections for crypto-asset investments given they have become increasingly mainstream and are heavily advertised and promoted. There is a strong case for regulation of crypto-assets to better protect investors.""

Since the survey, interest rate hikes have spurred investors to exit speculative assets, sending cryptocurrencies' prices tumbling and sending some crypto-related businesses into bankruptcy.

The survey was conducted in the same month bitcoin and ether , the two most popular cryptocurrencies, hit record highs. Both have slid about two-thirds since then, while the Australian stock market is down about 6%.

LONDON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - HSBC , its online arm First Direct, and Metro Bank (MTRO.L) have joined a fraud-reporting hotline as the cost of living crisis increases the number of financial scams, an industry body said on Tuesday.

Britain has become the scam capital of the world as more people bank online, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic began unfolding in 2020. read more

Stop Scams UK, a banking and online industry network launched a year ago, allows customers to dial 159 to report a fraud to their own bank rather than having to find its number.

Members already include Barclays, Meta, Microsoft, Google, NatWest, Nationwide Building Society, Santander and Talk Talk.

""By calling 159 it will help people break the scammer’s spell, it’s an important piece of armour that customers can use to help in protecting themselves,"" said Baz Thompson, head of fraud at Metro Bank.

UK Finance, a banking industry body, has said there was a 39% increase last year in fraudsters tricking customers into making real-time payments.

In cash terms, criminal gangs stole over 583 million pounds from individuals and small businesses, by pretending to be either a bank or other service provider.

""The cost-of-living crisis is only making the problem worse,"" Stop Scams UK said.

Faced with rocketing energy, mortgage and food bills, many more households will become vulnerable to scams.

HSBC, First Direct and Metro add 18.5 million customers to the 159 service, which now covers the overwhelming majority of UK banking customers, Stops Scams UK said.

Since its launch in September last year, there have been over 150,000 calls to the hotline, and Britain has proposed an 'online safety bill' to help regulators crack down harder on financial scams.

Banks hope the bill will include clearer guidance allowing them to share anonymised customer data for spotting new types of scams faster, but it faces opposition from privacy campaigners.

505,META,2022-09-30,Disney names Carolyn Everson to board in deal with activist investor Third Point,"













Sept 30 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) on Friday announced a truce with activist investor Third Point, saying it would appoint tech and media veteran Carolyn Everson to the board with the support of the shareholder.

The hedge fund, led by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, said in August it planned to push the entertainment and media conglomerate to make a string of changes, from spinning off cable sports channel ESPN to buying back shares and adding new board members. read more

However, Third Point reached an agreement with Disney on Friday to not present any proposal at any stockholder meeting until 2024, as long as Everson remains on the board, and to vote in accordance with the board's recommendations.

The activist shareholder also agreed to not raise its stake in the company to over 2% and to vote in favor of the slate of directors nominated by Disney's board.

Third Point did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Loeb had exited his position in the company, known for its theme parks and movies like ""Aladdin"" and ""Frozen"", months earlier when fears about rising prices and faster interest rate hikes sparked a sharp market selloff, before re-investing nearly $1 billion in the company in August for a 0.4% stake.

Chief Executive Bob Chapek, who confirmed reports there were enquiries made to buy ESPN, told Reuters earlier this month he believes the sports television network is an asset to the company. read more

Everson, 50, who is on Coca-Cola's (KO.N) board, has worked with Meta Platforms' (META.O) Facebook where she ran the global marketing and ad sales team for the social media giant.

Most recently, Everson was president of Instacart and her career has included leadership roles at Microsoft Corp and at Viacom, now part of Paramount Global (PARA.O).

NEW DELHI, April 12 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc's (FB.O) WhatsApp has won regulatory approval to more than double the number of users of its payments service in India to 100 million, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.

WhatsApp has over the years told National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) that there should be no cap on users of its payments service in India, its biggest market.

Instead, the NPCI told the company on Wednesday it can increase the number of users to 100 million from 40 million currently, the sources said.

WhatsApp did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The NPCI confirmed the development in a statement to Reuters.

Though the relaxation will come as a relief, the new cap could still limit WhatsApp's growth prospects given it has more than 500 million users in India.

WhatsApp has told the NPCI several times it wants to operate ""without a cap"", but privately the NPCI is of the view that allowing all its users to access the payments service - integrated with the app and allowing contacts to send each other funds - could strain the country's financial infrastructure, said one of the sources.

The NPCI gave WhatsApp approval to launch the payments service in 2020 after the company spent years trying to comply with Indian regulations, including data storage norms that require all payments-related data to be stored locally.

It started with 20 million users and the cap was increased to 40 million in November last year. read more

WhatsApp competes with Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google Pay, SoftBank- and Ant Group-backed Paytm (PAYT.NS) and Walmart’s (WMT.N) PhonePe in India's crowded digital market.

Online transactions, lending and e-wallet services have been growing rapidly in India, led by a government push to make the country’s cash-loving merchants and consumers adopt digital payments.

Summary Companies Ex-Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch joins e-commerce company Etsy

Stretch most recently worked at law firm Latham & Watkins and taught at Columbia University















(Reuters) - Online marketplace Etsy Inc said Thursday that Colin Stretch, the former general counsel of Facebook, will join the company as its top lawyer effective Feb. 14.

Stretch will serve as Brooklyn, New York-based Etsy's chief legal officer and corporate secretary. He worked for about six years as the top lawyer at Facebook, now known as Meta Platforms Inc, until 2019.

He most recently became of counsel at law firm Latham & Watkins in August. A firm spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

At Etsy, Stretch replaces Jill Simeone as legal chief. An Etsy spokesperson said Simeone moved to an advisory role in order to spend more time with her family and that she continues to support the company's legal department and will help with the transition.

Stretch said in a statement that the e-commerce company ""has a strong reputation as not only a prospering business but as a leader in the advocacy space."" The spokesperson said he was not available for additional comment.

As Facebook's general counsel, Stretch testified before Congress in high-profile hearings in 2017 as the U.S. investigated Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

After leaving in 2019, he began lecturing at Columbia University's law and business schools.

Etsy, founded in 2005, is an online marketplace for handmade and vintage items.

""Colin's extensive experience will be critical to Etsy's efforts to ensure we remain a safe and trusted marketplace, broaden our reach across all our brands, and advocate for microbusinesses around the world,"" Etsy CEO Josh Silverman said in a statement.

508,META,2022-10-26,Morning Bid: Consumer drain as banks gain,"













A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.

This year's inflation and interest rate shock to consumers is mirrored by the massive windfall for the world's leading banks - the political optics of which rankle as central banks are set to push borrowing rates even higher.

Deep in the weeds of the third-quarter earnings season, Big Tech and other consumer favourites are clearly feeling the chill of the cost of living crisis as well as a higher dollar and supply chain disruptions - upping global recession fears as financial conditions tighten. read more

Quarterly results from mega caps Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) disappointed late Tuesday and sent both their shares down about 7% after the bell, cutting across an earlier surge in Wall St stock benchmarks (.SPX). S&P500 futures were down almost 1% on Wednesday, halving Tuesday's index gain.

Google's results in particular bode ill for Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META.O), especially reliant on advertising and reporting its results late on Wednesday. Apple and Amazon detail how their businesses fared on Thursday.

Consumer blues contrasted with bumper earnings from banks who are raking in huge windfalls from rising interest rates - direct cash injections from reserves they hold at central banks along with higher net interest margins and trading revenues flattered by volatile markets. read more read more read more read more

European banks reporting this week matched Wall St counterparts on that score, raising conundrums for the European Central Bank meeting this week and Bank of England and U.S. Federal Reserve gatherings next week. They all plan further policy rate rises to rein in inflation - but this also involves direct transfers to their banks and potentially a drain on government finances. read more

The Bank of Canada is expected to lift rates by another three-quarters of a percentage point to a fresh 14-year high later on Wednesday, and Canada's dollar climbed sharply in advance of the decision. read more

The darkening economic skies responsible for the dour real sector earnings were still clear in downbeat U.S. consumer confidence and housing readings on Tuesday, and mounting recession fears have raised speculation about whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon be forced to slow the blistering pace of credit tightening. read more read more

With energy price rises also easing back gradually, especially Russia-squeezed natural gas costs in Europe, hopes for some Fed respite fears dragged long-term bond yields and the U.S. dollar back lower again too.

Ten-year Treasury yields have lunged back close to 4% over the past 24 hours, more than 30 basis points below Friday's peak. The dollar recoiled across the world against the euro, yen, sterling and yuan - sliding back through parity versus the euro for the first since in over a month.

Chinese shares (.CSI300), (.HSI) finally stabilised on Wednesday after this week's withering slide on worries about the economic and political direction of reconfirmed President Xi Jinping's new cabinet. The offshore yuan rebounded from record lows against a weaker dollar.

Sterling also caught the slipstream of a falling greenback but UK government borrowing rates edged back up on reports Britain's new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak could delay the announcement of a plan to repair the country's public finances beyond the expected Oct 31. read more

Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday:

* U.S. Sept new home sales, trade balance, wholesale inventories. Eurozone Sept credit and money supply,

* Bank of Canada policy decision

* U.S. Treasury auctions 5-year notes, 2-year FRNs.

* Bank of England Director for Financial Stability, Strategy and Risk Lee Foulger speaks in London

* French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz hold a press conference following talks in Paris

* U.S. corp earnings: Meta, Ford, General Dynamics, Boston Scientific, Bristol Myers Squibb, Kraft Heinz, Hilton Worldwide, Norfolk Southern, Fortive, Amphenol, Waste Management, Rollins, Garmin, Teledyne, Avery Dennison, Hess, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Align Technology, Molina Healthcare, ADP, EQT, CME, IDEX, Globe Life, Everest Re, United Rentals, Roper Tech, Otis Worldwide, Old Dominion Freight Line, UDR, KLA, O'Reilly Automotive, Raymond James Financial, Fortune Brands, Invitation Homes

Summary Companies Caterpillar, McDonald's gain on earnings beats

U.S. economic growth rebounds in Q3

Meta plunges on weak forecast

Amazon slumps after the bell following weak report

Dow up 0.61%, Nasdaq down 1.63%, S&P down 0.61%















NEW YORK, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq posted losses on Thursday, as investors contended with solid economic data and a mixed bag of corporate earnings.

The price-weighted Dow advanced, held aloft by industrials (.SPLRCI), while weakness in market-moving tech and tech-adjacent megacaps depressed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in the wake of downbeat quarterly results and dour guidance.

""It’s very much a bifurcated market, a tale of two cities,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist Ingalls & Snyder in New York.

""There's lot of pressure on tech and tech-plus names, higher growth names,"" Ghriskey added. ""On the flipside you’re seeing a lot of strength in other sectors, in particular consumer staples, energy, financials, industrials and utilities.""

After the bell, Amazon (AMZN.O) slumped 12%, erasing over $100 billion of its stock market value after the retail and tech heavyweight forecast a slowdown in sales growth for the holiday season, disappointing Wall Street and warning that inflation-wary consumers and businesses had less money to spend.

That sent S&P 500 futures down 0.5% and Nasdaq futures down 0.6%, showing traders expect Wall Street to open lower on Friday.

During Thursday's trading session, Meta Platforms (META.O) plunged 24.6% after the Facebook parent followed the trend set by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) by providing gloomy forward guidance.

But heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly profit, sending its shares jumping 7.7% and providing the most muscle to the Dow's advance.

A third-quarter GDP reading showing the U.S. economy returned to growth in the July-Sept period, along with steady quarterly core inflation helped take the sting out of earnings.

GDP

Investors continue to scan the economic horizon for evidence that the barrage of aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, begun in March, are beginning to have the desired effect by cooling down the economy.

While a 75 basis point rate hike at the conclusion of its Nov. 1-2 policy meeting is all but assured, the likelihood of a smaller, 50 basis point hike in December was 55%, according to CME's FedWatch tool.

""The overriding theme is really the Fed. The Fed is going to control the direction of this market over the coming months,"" Ghriskey added.

At Thursday's close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) was up 194.17 points, or 0.61%, to 32,033.28, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 23.3 points, or 0.61%, to 3,807.3 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 178.32 points, or 1.63%, to 10,792.68.

Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, industrials had the biggest percentage gain, with communication services (.SPLRCL), weighed by Meta, down the most.

Third-quarter reporting season forges ahead at full speed, with 227 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 74% have beaten consensus estimates.

Analysts now see aggregate S&P earnings growth of 2.5%, down from 4.5% at the beginning of October.

""In general we’ve seen earnings come in at or slightly above expectations,"" Ghriskey said. ""But those expectations have been lowered throughout the quarter.""

McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) gained 3.3% after the fast food chain beat quarterly same-store sales estimates.

Shares of Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) rose 2.7% after the carrier's quarterly profit topped consensus estimates.

Also after the bell, Intel (INTC.O) rallied 5% after the chipmaker cut its full-year profit and revenue forecast and said it was targeting $3 billion in cost reductions in 2023.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.18-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.10-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 23 new 52-week highs and 12 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 93 new highs and 119 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.36 billion shares, compared with the 11.59 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

Oct 25 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever

Bad (economic) news is good news, and good (earnings) news is also good news.

That's the general outlook on Wall Street right now as investors continue to claw back some of this year's losses - U.S. stocks on Monday shrugged off steep declines in Asia, especially China, to extend the bear market rally of the last two weeks.

The S&P 500 has rebounded some 9% from its Oct. 13 low, laughing in the face of rising bond yields and interest rate expectations. Monday's gains came despite recession-territory U.S. PMIs and a spike in the VIX volatility index back above 30.

Investors have plenty of other reasons to be cautious too: liquidity and financial stability concerns; political, economic and market trends in China; Japan's policy conundrum and FX market interventions; British political and market turbulence.

The news flow from Asia, in particular, is not conducive to a 'risk-on' trading environment. MSCI Asia ex-Japan and China's benchmark indexes fell to post-2020 lows on Monday, and the offshore yuan slumped to its lowest level since it was introduced in 2010.

You wouldn't bet against Asian and U.S. stock markets continuing to diverge.

One relative bright spot, however, could be U.S. earnings. So far, almost one-fifth of S&P 500 companies have reported. Of those, 75% have beat expectations, according to Refinitiv data.

The Q3 reporting season goes into overdrive this week with results from tech giants and tech-heavy firms including Twitter, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Meta Platforms and Amazon.com all on the docket.

If the Wall Street rebound is to continue and ripple to Asia, these results in particular could be crucial.

Oct 27 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever

First Australia, now Canada. Who'll be next to blink on interest rates?

The Bank of Canada on Wednesday raised rates by 50 basis points, less than the 75 bps markets had expected. This surprise mirrored the Reserve Bank of Australia's half point hike three weeks ago, when investors had again positioned for an additional 25 bps of tightening.

""We are getting closer to the end of this tightening phase,"" BOC chief Tiff Macklem said, citing recession fears.

That's two of the world's major central banks now signaling that the peak in rates is in sight, while Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said last week that the market's rate path was too aggressive.

The European Central Bank and Bank of Japan are up next with policy decisions in the next 48 hours. Although they are at very different stages of the cycle - the BOJ hasn't even started tightening yet - dovish surprises could add fuel to the 'risk on' rally currently underway.

chart

Ok, Wall Street struggled on Wednesday in part due to earnings misses from Microsoft and Alphabet, but the S&P 500 hit a six-week high intraday and is up 7% this month. The VIX volatility index hit a six-week low, while bond yields fell sharply for a second day.

The dollar is also falling, another development that should in theory ease financial conditions and support risk assets. It is down 2% this week, on track for its biggest weekly fall since the COVID-19 pandemic's darkest days in March 2020.

Only time will tell how much of all this is simply a snap back in extreme positioning. But if the remaining heavyweight U.S. earnings this week beat forecasts and the ECB and BOJ play ball, it could have further to run.

Three key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Thursday:

ECB rate decision (expected 75 bps hike)

512,META,2022-10-04,Twitter surges as Musk proposes going through with deal,"













Oct 4 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc's stock (TWTR.N) surged on Tuesday after billionaire Elon Musk proposed to go ahead with his takeover of the social media platform at $54.20 per share. read more

Twitter jumped over 22% to end at $52.00 after a securities filing showed Musk intends to go ahead with his April offer of $44 billion to take Twitter private, signaling an end to a legal battle that could have forced Musk to pay up. Musk is also chief executive of electric car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O).

Tesla gained 2.9% to $249.44, down from an earlier high of $257.50.

Earlier, Twitter's stock had been halted after a report from Bloomberg News about Musk's plans.

Over $27 billion worth of Tesla shares were exchanged, the highest turnover for the electric vehicle since mid-August, according to Refinitiv data.

Elon Musk vs Twitter

Musk and Twitter were set to enter the courtroom this month, with Twitter seeking an order directing Musk to follow through on his agreement last April to buy the company for the agreed-to price. Musk ripped up the deal in August, saying he was misled about the number of spam accounts on Twitter.

Tesla's stock has been under pressure since Musk agreed to buy Twitter, with investors concerned about how much of the car maker's shares he might sell to fund the purchase.

Musk shields Twitter from social media meltdown

The possibility that Musk might follow through on his deal has shielded Twitter's stock price in recent months from a meltdown in the shares of other social media companies amid a broad Wall Street sell-off over worries about rising interest rates and a weak economy.

With Tuesday's gains, Twitter is up 20% year-to-date, versus a drop of more than 50% in Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O).

513,META,2023-02-01,Morning Bid: A quart and two halves,"













A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.

After a heady January brew, investors now see triples all round.

Global stock markets (.MIWD00000PUS) put in their best January in four years, with Wall St's tech-heavy Nasdaq (.IXIC) clocking its biggest January gains since 2001, but now face three tense days to assess how durable that is.

On the radar are three interest rate rises from G4 central banks over the next 26 hours, a mega cap earnings barrage from Apple, Amazon and Alphabet later on Thursday and then the U.S. January jobs report to round out a frenetic week.

February kicked off on Wednesday without too much trepidation about how all that will pan out. Asia and European bourses pushed higher despite a mixed bag of economic news, but S&P500 futures did slip into the red ahead of Wall St's open.

Softer U.S. Treasury yields were calm and collected, the dollar relatively serene.

An expected quarter-point interest rate rise from the U.S. Federal Reserve later on Wednesday would ruffle few feathers as long as the central bank doesn't feel the need to accompany its slowing of the rate hikes with a harsh steer against market pricing for rate cuts later in the year.

Half-point rate rises from the European Central Bank and Bank of England are now the best guess, although dire economic readouts from Britain's ailing economy this year may mean the risk to that consensus is that a split BoE council opts for a smaller move.

News that euro zone headline inflation fell much faster than forecast last month to 8.5% - its lowest since last May - will also take some pressure off the ECB, even if stickier 'core' inflation means a half-point point move is still the most likely outcome this week.

U.S. markets were also enthused by disinflation signals on Tuesday as data showed U.S. labor costs increasing at their slowest pace in a year in the fourth quarter while wage growth slowed.

That was a major relief for those worried about the persistent tightness in the U.S. jobs markets - one reason the Fed may continue to sound hawkish later on Wednesday and why Friday's payrolls update is even more important than usual.

Before the Fed announcement, ADP releases its January private sector employment readout for last month and markets will also scan the December JOLTS job openings report.

In Asia, surveys showed the contraction in China's business activity easing in January as the country opens up again after strict COVID lockdowns. The speed of the pickup disappointed some, however, and may in itself cool fears about the inflationary impact of China's sudden return to business as usual.

India's government unveiled one of its biggest jumps in capital spending in the past decade in its annual budget and said the fiscal deficit would fall, as it tries to create jobs while maintaining financial discipline.

The news was less good for one of India's richest citizens.

Shares in tycoon Gautam Adani's conglomerate plunged again on Wednesday as a rout in his companies deepened to $84 billion in the wake of a U.S. short-seller report, with the billionaire also losing his title as Asia's richest person.

While markets await the 'Triple-A' of Big Tech releases on Thursday, Meta (META.O) is due to report later today and the dour news from elsewhere in the tech sector kept coming.

Overnight, Snap (SNAP.N) said current quarter revenue could decline by as much as 10%, sending its shares down 14% as the company struggles with weak advertising demand.

Intel (INTC.O) said it had made broad cuts to employee and executive pay, a week after the company issued a lower-than-expected sales forecast driven by a loss of market share to rivals and a PC market downturn.

Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday:

* U.S. Federal Reserve policy decision, press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell

* US Jan ISM manufacturing survey, ADP Jan private sector job report, Dec JOLTS job openings report

* U.S. corp earnings: Meta Platforms, MetLife, Mckesson, Boston Scientific, Otis Worldwide, Old Dominion, Align Technology, Corteva, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Altria, Humana, Peleton etc

514,META,2022-11-01,China aims to ship 25 million virtual reality devices by 2026,"













HONG KONG, Nov 1 (Reuters) - China released its first action plan dedicated to virtual reality on Tuesday, with an aim its industry ship more than 25 million devices with a value exceeding 350 billion yuan ($48.20 billion) by 2026.

It was published by five ministries in Beijing, led by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and categorised virtual reality as a key industry for the digital economy under the country's 14th five-year plan.

The paper includes augmented reality and mixed reality in its definition of virtual reality.

This first action plan reflects Beijing’s ambition to lead the world in virtual technology and sets detailed goals.

It did not specify whether the 25 million devices target referred to annual or accumulative shipments between now and 2026.

In the first half of this year, China shipped just over half a million virtual reality and augmented reality devices, research firm IDC said.

The plan also includes a target to increase the total value of the industry to more than 350 billion yuan, which the ministries say includes hardware and software sales.

It added that China will need to nurture 100 core companies and form 10 public service platforms for the industry by 2026.

The China Academy of Information and Communications, a state-backed think tank, published a report on Tuesday saying that China's motivation for the action plan should be seen in the context of the U.S. and South Korea governments having identified virtual reality as an important industry.

It also makes reference to global tech giants including Meta (META.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Google (GOOGL.O) and Tencent , citing them as companies rapidly pursuing virtual reality opportunities.

515,META,2022-05-09,Face scanner firm Clearview AI agrees to limits to settle lawsuit,"













May 9 (Reuters) - The facial recognition startup Clearview AI agreed to restrictions on how businesses can use its database of billions of facial images, to resolve a lawsuit it accusing it of collecting people's photos without permission.

Under a settlement filed on Monday in an Illinois state court in Chicago, Clearview AI will stop granting paid or free access to its database to most private businesses and individuals.

It also agreed to stop providing its database to government agencies in Illinois, including police and other law enforcement, for five years.

Clearview AI, based in New York, can still work with federal government agencies, including immigration authorities, as well as state government agencies outside Illinois.

The case had been brought in May 2020 by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), groups representing undocumented immigrants and victims of sexual and domestic violence, and others.

They accused Clearview AI of repeatedly violating the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act by scraping photos taken from the internet, including from platforms such as Microsoft's (MSFT.O) LinkedIn and Facebook's (FB.O) Instagram.

Facebook, part of Meta Platforms Inc, agreed in 2020 to pay $650 million to settle class-action litigation accusing it of violating the Illinois law.

Critics of Clearview AI have said its technology violated people's privacy, while the company has said blocking it from using publicly-available images amounted to censorship.

Monday's settlement requires court approval. Clearview AI did not admit liability, negligence or fault in agreeing to settle.

Both sides characterized the settlement as a big win.

Floyd Abrams, one of Clearview AI's lawyers and among the most prominent First Amendment lawyers, in a statement said the accord does not require material changes to the company's business model or bar conduct it now engages in.

Nathan Freed Wessler, deputy director of the ACLU Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, in a statement said the settlement ""demonstrates that strong privacy laws can provide real protections against abuse.""

516,META,2022-06-07,"Making Big Tech share telecoms costs would undermine EU net neutrality, rights groups say","













BRUSSELS, June 8 (Reuters) - Europe's net neutrality rules that support an open internet would be undermined if EU regulators force tech giants Google (GOOGL.O), Meta (FB.O) and Netflix (NFLX.O) to shoulder some of the costs of its telecoms network, digital rights activists warned on Wednesday.

The comments from 34 NGOs from 17 countries, which include European Digital Rights, Civil Liberties Union for Europe, ARTICLE 19 and Electronic Frontier Foundation, came in an open letter to European Commission digital chief Margrethe Vestager and EU industry chief Thierry Breton.

The groups said they were concerned about comments from Vestager last month in which she suggested Big Tech firms might have to contribute to the cost of telecoms infrastructure - something telecoms operators have long lobbied for. read more

EU net neutrality rules mean internet service providers (ISPs) can't block or throttle traffic to give priority to some services. Some experts fear this commitment might get watered down in a deal with Big Tech to help fund telecoms networks.

""Charging content and application providers for the use of internet infrastructure would undermine and conflict with core net neutrality protections in the European Union,"" the groups said.

They compared such a move to the Trump administration's attempt to eliminate net neutrality protections in the United States.

The groups criticised EU telecom companies for pushing a proposal first raised in 2012.

""The EU's net neutrality law allows Europeans to use the bandwidth they buy from their ISPs however they want – whether for Netflix, YouTube, Facebook, or for a small, local site or service,"" they said.

""Thus European telecom companies are already compensated by their own internet service customers for transporting this data over their access networks; they simply want to be paid twice for the same service.""

517,META,2022-04-19,Analysis: Twitter exploring a sale would make free speech an afterthought,"













April 19 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc's (TWTR.N) board directors can lean on concerns about the fate of the social media platform under Elon Musk to rebuff him, but if they decide to explore a sale, price will override all other considerations, corporate governance experts said.

The San Francisco-based company received a $43 billion ""best and final"" offer from Musk last week, which it is still reviewing. Musk, the world's richest person and CEO of Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), has said he wants to make Twitter an ""arena for free speech,"" cheering Twitter's critics who complain about censorship and alarming those worried about hate speech and bullying. read more

Twitter's board is expected to reject Musk's bid as too low by April 28, when it is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings, people familiar with the matter have said. Even if Twitter's bankers declared the offer was fair, the company's board directors have wide latitude to reject it if they thought the platform was better off with its current content strategy, corporate governance lawyers and professors said. read more

This would change, however, if, Twitter's board decided to explore a sale, either because it received more offers or it decided to solicit acquisition bids, these experts said.

Corporate law in Delaware, where Twitter is incorporated, dictates that once a company launches a sale process, securing the most lucrative deal for shareholders becomes the overarching consideration. Board directors are not allowed to factor in what would happen to the company in their deliberations if existing shareholders will cash out.

""All these culture and discourse and democracy considerations fall by wayside because that’s not going to benefit shareholders anymore,"" said Ann Lipton, a professor at Tulane Law School.

Twitter and Musk spokespeople did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

As it stands, board directors legally have wide discretion on how to handle Musk's bid because it was unsolicited. The directors can refuse to engage with Musk if they believe the company's content policies and culture better serve the long-term interests of its investors, said Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School.

""If they think Musk will turn Twitter into a free-speech hellscape, that is sufficient justification,"" Quinn said.

Whether Twitter will decide to explore a sale will likely hinge on whether it receives attractive and credible offers in the coming days.

Private equity firm Thoma Bravo LP contacted Twitter last week to express interest in putting together an offer that would challenge Musk, but there is no certainty that such a bid will materialize, sources told Reuters. Sources have also said that other buyout firms have since contacted Twitter to register their acquisition interest. read more

NO FOUNDER AROUND TO PROTECT IT

Unlike its peers Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O), Twitter is not controlled by founders with supervoting shares who can shoot down a deal even if viable and lucrative offers are on the table. Twitter adopted a poison pill last week to prevent Musk, who has amassed a stake in the company of more than 9%, from raising his stake to more than 15% without negotiating a deal with its board. read more

Adding to its vulnerability, Twitter has not set up a structure governing the moderation of its platform that would survive under new ownership. It has not, for example, set up a formal process for an independent arbiter to review its decisions, though its users can appeal to the company if their account is locked or suspended.

Meta, on the other hand, has set up an external Oversight Board, which allows users to appeal Facebook's decisions to remove or leave up certain content. The Oversight Board’s decisions are binding.

Twitter could face backlash from some of its shareholders if it does not explore a sale, including from Musk, who has tweeted that he wants the company's shareholders to have a say irrespective of what its board thinks. Musk could challenge the board in the company's 2023 annual meeting of shareholders by putting forward his own slate of nominees, and, if successful, force the company to explore a sale.

Unless Twitter decides to explore a sale, it can continue to look out for the interests of stakeholders beyond shareholders, such as its users and employees, corporate governance experts say.

""You are explicitly allowed to point to non-shareholder constituencies as your rationale for wanting to beat back the takeover,"" said Eric Talley, a professor at Columbia Law School.

LONDON, March 25 (Reuters) - Ukraine started auctioning off a collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Friday in an expansion of a cryptocurrency fundraising push that Kyiv says has already collected more than $65 million for its war effort.

The 'Meta History: Museum of War' collection is a series of digital images - including silhouettes of warplanes, screengrabs of news reports and a cartoon-style image of an explosion - each one marking a different day in the conflict.

Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation started appealing for donations in digital tokens such as bitcoin and ether three days after Russia launched its invasion, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"".

The new NFT series was meant ""to spread truthful information among the digital community in the world and to collect donations for the support of Ukraine,"" according to a message on the collection's website.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a type of crypto asset that exploded in popularity last year. They use the technology behind bitcoin to record who owns a digital file from a image to video or piece of text. read more

Ukraine has so far bought supplies for its military with its crypto donations including bulletproof vests, helmets, lunches and medicines, Ukraine's deputy minister of digital transformation, Alex Bornyakov, said on Twitter this month.

NFTs are usually bought with cryptocurrencies such as ether. Ukraine's NFTs will initially cost 0.15 ether, or just over $475. The funds will go directly to Kyiv's digital crypto wallets, according to the website.

The explosive rise in NFT sales left many observers baffled as to why so much money is spent on items that don't physically exist.

Still, they have become a popular fundraising tool in recent months, with groups of people pooling their crypto funds to buy NFTs to raise awareness of a particular cause. read more

519,META,2023-02-03,'Life goes on' after Brazil riots but problems must be tackled: Supreme Court Justice,"













LISBON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Brazil must make sure it addresses the problems that led to the riots in Brasilia last month, including the ""politicisation"" of the police and the role of social media, but, for now, life goes on as usual, Supreme Court Justice Gilmar Mendes said on Friday.

Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a business conference in Portugal's capital Lisbon, Mendes said problems ""accumulated"" during the four years far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro was in power.

Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings on Jan. 8, calling for a military coup to restore their leader who left the country without conceding defeat by leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who was sworn in on the first day of the year.

""There's a debate taking place about the role of these radical groups, (about) what needs to be done,"" Mendes said, explaining authorities were looking into the alleged involvement of security forces in the riots.

Lula has said the local militarised police force did not do enough to stop the advance of the protesters. The Supreme Court is leading the criminal probe into the riots.

Mendes said it was important to discuss reforms in the security sector to tackle what he described as the ""politicisation"" of the police. He said there were issues with the armed forces too.

He also said it was crucial to address the role played by social media platforms. People took to social media and messaging platforms to organise protests in support of Bolsonaro.

Facebook parent Meta and Google's video platform YouTube said they removed content supporting or praising the riots.

""It is a responsible reflection ... but (the current) situation (is) of normality,"" Mendes said. ""The country is moving forward... The stock market continues to rise, the dollar is under control, congress is functioning, life goes on as usual.

""I think democracy, once again, showed its resilience.""

520,META,2023-02-21,Hotels share revival shrugs off two crises,"













LONDON, Feb 21 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Hotel groups are in restoration mode. Holiday Inn owner InterContinental (IHG.L) said on Tuesday its operating profit from reportable segments soared 55% to $828 million in 2022 thanks to a revival in the U.S. market, customers taking longer holidays and its ability to hike prices. Chief Executive Keith Barr reckons the year ahead will continue to see strong demand, boosted by China’s re-opening.

Investors appear to believe him: InterContinental is only finally set to exceed 2019’s revenue this year, with analysts pencilling in sales of $2.2 billion, according to Refinitiv. Yet its share price is 18% above its pre-pandemic levels. To deliver on such optimism, the group will need to keep drawing punters to its high-priced rooms even as the cost of living crisis and higher interest rates bite in the U.S. and Europe. Revenue per available room, a key pricing metric, rose 37% last year.

Then there’s China. In 2019, the People’s Republic accounted for around 10% of the hotel market, and its citizens spent over $250 billion on international tourism, according to the World Tourism Organisation. Yet Covid-19 may still hurt spending in the Middle kingdom, and geopolitical tensions may lead to fewer Chinese people travelling. Investors are betting that hotels can be as safe as houses.

NEW YORK, Dec 6 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Meta Platforms (META.O) is taking a bold stand against a new piece of legislation, yet it’s Elon Musk’s Twitter that looks most exposed. The U.S. Congress is considering adding the “Journalism Competition and Preservation Act” to a defense bill that has a high likelihood of passing, according to Reuters. The law allows publishers to collectively negotiate with online platforms on content. The Facebook operator is threatening to pull news off its feed if it is passed, spokesperson Andy Stone tweeted.

loading

Most Americans turn to social media to find out what’s cooking, but they utilize platforms differently. For example, two-thirds of U.S. adults use Facebook, but less than half of them get their news on it, according to the Pew Research Center. Twitter meanwhile reaches about a quarter of the American adult population. The overwhelming majority of the people on that platform regularly read it for news.

It suggests that the news business is offering Twitter quite a lot of traffic, and so organizations that are protected by this agreement – those with no more than 1,500 employees – will have some negotiating power. Musk has many problems. The e-version of the daily rag just became one more. (By Jennifer Saba)

522,META,2022-12-02,"Germany, others demand clarity on EU plan on telco network costs","













BRUSSELS, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Germany and five other countries on Friday joined in a debate that has drawn support and opposition from interest groups as they asked the European Commission for clarity on plans to make Big Tech pay some of the costs of Europe's telecoms network.

Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), Orange (ORAN.PA), Telefonica (TEF.MC), Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) call it a fair share contribution, especially as the six largest content providers account for just over half of data internet traffic.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Meta (META.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and other tech giants, have labelled it an internet traffic tax and an attempt to appropriate money from one industry to support the old guard.

The European Commission's industry chief Thierry Breton has said he will launch a consultation in early 2023 before proposing legislation.

""We as member states have always considered an open and transparent debate on substance on the 'fair share' topic as of great importance,"" Austria, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands and Germany, Europe's leading economy, wrote in a joint letter to the Commission.

""However, we urge the Commission to further create transparency on its intended timeline, analyses and steps on this topic,"" they said.

The countries also said the topic should handled separately and not conflated with another piece of legislation known as the Broadband Cost Reduction Directive (BCRD), which they said dealt with different issues. The BCRD aims to set out measures to cut the cost of deploying fast-speed networks.

April 21 (Reuters) - A Russian court has fined Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL.O) Google 11 million roubles ($137,763) for failing to delete what it terms ""fake"" information about the conflict in Ukraine and YouTube videos produced by Ukrainian far-right groups, TASS reported.

Russia's communications watchdog said earlier this month that it was taking steps to punish Google for ""spreading fakes"" on YouTube, and has previously warned the U.S. company that it would be fined if it failed to comply, part of a wider battle with foreign tech firms and media to control information flows.

Google was found guilty of committing administrative violations and fined 4 million roubles and 7 million roubles in two cases, Moscow's Tagansky District Court said on Thursday.

Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The TASS news agency said the fines pertained to what Moscow considers the distribution of inaccurate data about Russian troops losses and civilian casualties in Ukraine, as well as the distribution of video clips on YouTube produced by Ukrainian far-right groups such as the nationalist Azov battalion.

Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists.

Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Moscow in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.

Russia has blocked some foreign social media firms, including Meta Platforms Inc's (FB.O) Facebook and Instagram, with domestic firms looking to pick up the pieces. YouTube, though under increasing pressure from the Russian government, remains available. read more

The RIA news agency on Thursday reported that another case had been drawn up against Google for what it said was the distribution of videos on YouTube that called for terror attacks in Russia.

524,META,2022-12-15,"Stripe, Shopify commit $11 million to carbon removal projects","Companies Shopify Inc Follow

Alphabet Inc Follow















LONDON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Online payments firm Stripe and e-commerce group Shopify have committed to spend $11 million supporting projects to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and oceans in the latest round of the Frontier fund set up to develop the technology.

Even with pledges of huge reductions in emissions, many scientists believe extracting carbon dioxide (CO2) by using nature or technology will be essential to meet global goals set under the Paris climate agreement to curb climate change.

Frontier was set up by global commerce and technology firms Stripe, Shopify, Meta, Alphabet and McKinsey Sustainability, with the aim of investing $925 million on carbon removal credits between 2022 and 2030 to help speed deployment and drive down costs.

""Removals don’t have an intrinsic value at the moment, and we want to give those building the technology the confidence there are going to be buyers,"" Nan Ransohoff, head of climate at Stripe and head of Frontier, told Reuters.

In this round, Shopify and Stripe have committed to buy 7,011 tonnes of credits from seven companies for a total of $3.5 million, with prices ranging from $227 to $1,318 per tonne depending on the project.

They have also committed an additional $7.5 million contingent on projects reaching technical milestones.

Due to their early stage and complexity, carbon removal credits are much more expensive than traditional offsets which pay for emissions cuts elsewhere to compensate for emissions companies have not cut themselves.

The removal projects include Inplanet, which uses enhanced rock weathering to sequester CO2, Carbin Minerals, which uses mine waste to trap CO2, and Captura, which is seeking to remove CO2 from ocean water.

Stripe will spend a further $0.5 mln supporting research and development at two other early-stage companies.

Stacy Kauk, Shopify’s head of sustainability, said the credits would be delivered over the next few years depending on the project type.

Shopify will either retire them to help meet its own emission reduction goals, or offer them to customers via its Planet app, she said.

525,META,2022-05-19,U.S. launches $3.5 bln program to speed development of up carbon removal tech,"Law firms Un Cha Kim Follow















WASHINGTON, May 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. Energy Department launched a program on Thursday to fund four large-scale projects across the country that can remove carbon dioxide from the air, investing $3.5 billion in a nascent technology the Biden administration says is necessary to meet a goal of achieving net zero emissions by mid century.

The agency released a formal notice saying it would fund the $3.5 billion program created by the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastucture Law that would create four regional direct air capture hubs to spur the widespread deployment of the technology and carbon dioxide transport and storage infrastructure.

The U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report last month that said the world will need “carbon dioxide removal” technologies - ranging from planting trees that soak up carbon to grow, to costly technologies to suck carbon dioxide directly from the air to meet global goals to curb climate change.

“The UN's latest climate report made clear that removing legacy carbon pollution from the air through direct air capture and safely storing it is an essential weapon in our fight against the climate crisis,” said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm.

Carbon removal technology has gained major attention and investment in recent months. There are three major direct air capture projects under development that have emerged in North America and Europe but they are only sucking up small amounts of CO2 from the air currently.

Earlier this year, technology firms Google, Shopify, Meta, and Stripe launched a $1 billion fund that will buy carbon removal credits over the next decade as a way to incentivize rapid deployment of the technology.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk last year offered inventors $100 million in prize money to develop new carbon removal technologies.

The DOE said that by midcentury, carbon removal will need to be deployed at the gigaton scale, meaning it would need to be able to sequester the equivalent of emissions from approximately 250 million vehicles driven in one year.

Companies Law firms Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher Llp Follow















(Reuters) - Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher said Monday that Gustav Eyler, who was a top U.S. Department of Justice consumer protection official, has joined the firm as a Washington, D.C.-based partner.

Eyler, who practiced as a litigation associate at Los Angeles-founded Gibson Dunn earlier in his career, served for five years as director of the consumer protection branch of the Justice Department's civil division, where he oversaw more than 250 prosecutors and staff, the firm said.

Eyler heads to the 1,700-lawyer firm after leaving the Justice Department last month, where he said he was involved in cases including the government's record $5 billion privacy settlement with Facebook, now Meta Platforms Inc, and the prosecution of Purdue Pharma over its handling of its addictive prescription opioid OxyContin.

Gibson Dunn has made other recent hires to its Washington office, including two last week. The firm picked up restructuring partner AnnElyse Scarlett Gains from Kirkland & Ellis, and Daniel Smith, who was U.S. Senator Cory Booker's chief counsel on the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, who joined the firm as of counsel.

At Gibson Dunn, Eyler said he plans to help clients facing government investigations, enforcement actions and related consumer class actions involving the life sciences, healthcare and consumer products sectors, and work with clients on data privacy matters.

He said he was ready for a new chapter after working on ""cutting-edge and meaningful"" matters at the Justice Department related to issues including the opioid crisis, fraud affecting the elderly and maintenance of safe food, drugs and medical devices.

Prior to becoming the consumer protection branch director in 2017, he held roles including counselor to the U.S. attorney general and as a prosecutor in the criminal division's fraud section and the U.S. attorney's office in Maryland, the firm said.

527,META,2022-11-28,Yahoo to buy minority stake in Taboola in digital ad push,"













Nov 28 (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc will buy nearly 25% of Taboola.com Ltd (TBLA.O) and become its largest shareholder in a deal allowing the online advertising company to exhibit paid content on the web portal's many sites.

The 30-year contract, announced on Monday, marks a big bet by internet pioneer Yahoo on digital advertising at a time when industry giants from Alphabet-owned Google (GOOGL.O) to Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) are struggling with an inflation-driven downturn in ad spending.

The Yahoo-Taboola partnership is expected to generate $1 billion in annual revenue, but the companies did not provide any other financial details. Yahoo will also get a seat on Taboola's board.

Yahoo, owned by private equity firm Apollo Global Management (APN.N) since a $5 billion buyout last year, has over the years been overtaken by Google and Facebook, but it still has nearly 900 million monthly active users thanks to a collection of sites such as Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Sports and TechCrunch.

Taboola, whose shares rose 60% on the news, pushes links to articles paid by advertisers - known as native advertising - on many websites such as CNBC and NBC News.

The deal will hand Taboola exclusive rights to sell native ads on Yahoo's sites.

The advertising firm said it expects the agreement to add to its revenue, operating earnings and free cash flow. In its latest earnings, Taboola posted a drop in quarterly revenue and also lowered its annual forecast because of a weak ad market.

The deal, which has been approved by the companies' boards, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023. Taboola plans to host a meeting on Dec. 30 to seek shareholders' approval.

Taboola, which went public through an about $2.6 billion blank-check merger in 2021, has lost 75% of its market value this year, as of last close.

528,META,2023-03-15,Morning Bid: Pride and prudence expected in UK budget,"













A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Ankur Banerjee

The relief rally in the market will be tested when British finance minister Jeremy Hunt presents the UK spring budget as he tries to speed up the world's sixth-biggest economy, with business lobbies clamouring for sweeteners.

Hunt, who was drafted in last year after former Prime Minister Liz Truss's mini budget in September shook UK markets, is due to speak at 1230 GMT and is expected to stay away from big tax cuts or spending increases.

That may sour risk appetite for investors after the relief rally got a leg up on Wednesday from China's economic activity data that showed gradual, but uneven recovery. Rising expectations that the Fed will not go back to jumbo hikes after Tuesday's inflation data also helped lift sentiment.

The market is now pricing in a roughly 80% chance of a 25 basis point increase, compared with last week when it priced in a 70% chance of a 50 bps hike. Some in the market still hope that the Fed will stay pat on rates. Retail sales data later in the day will shed more light on the state of economy.

European stocks may struggle to sustain the rally with futures indicating the market is due for a slightly higher open.

Banking stocks clawed back some of their steep losses as traders bet (or hope) that the worst of the SVB fallout is over as the contagion fears that gripped the market eased.

In the corporate world, focus will be on Credit Suisse after the Swiss bank said it had identified ""material weaknesses"" in internal controls over financial reporting.

Meanwhile, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms announced it would cut 10,000 jobs this year, making it the first Big Tech company to announce a second round of mass layoffs.

529,META,2022-10-27,Apple earnings rise as economic gloom hits tech,"













Oct 27 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Thursday reported revenue and profit that topped Wall Street targets, one of the few bright spots in a tech sector battered by spending cutbacks due to inflation.

The forecast for the holiday quarter was more grim. While not providing specific numbers, Apple said revenue growth would fall below 8% in the December quarter but did not go as far as Amazon.com AMZN.O, whose dire holiday outlook sent its shares down 14%.

Apple shares initially dipped in after-hours trading but recovered in positive territory.

The Cupertino, California-based tech giant was saved by its oldest technology, its laptop computers, while its star, the iPhone, stumbled.

Although iPhone sales were not as strong as some analysts had targeted, they were still a record for the September quarter. Mac sales of $11.5 billion were far head of analyst estimates of $9.36 billion.

Apple's results showed some resilience in the face of a weak economy and strong U.S. dollar that has led to disastrous reports from many tech companies. Like Facebook parent Meta (META.O) and Snap (SNAP.N), Apple is seeing softness in advertising spending. Overall, Apple said quarterly revenue rose 8% to $90.1 billion, above estimates of $88.9 billion, and net profit was $1.29 per share, topping with the average analyst estimate of $1.27 per share, according to Refinitiv data.

""We did better than we anticipated, in spite of the fact that foreign exchange was a significant negative for us,"" said Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri.

The rising U.S. dollar has hit many companies such as Apple that generate substantial foreign revenue and are getting less cash back when they convert it. For consumers, it increases the price of new devices when bought in countries outside of the United States.

Apple's iPhone sales for the company's fiscal fourth quarter rose to $42.6 billion, when Wall Street expected sales of $43.21 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES.

Maestri said iPhone sales set a record for the September quarter, improving 10% over the prior year's quarter and exceeding the company's forecast.

""The iPhone number is a hint of the turmoil and uncertainty in the market, but Apple has different ways to offset,"" said Runar Bjorhovde, a research analyst at market research firm Canalys.

Sales of Apple's Mac computers received a boost from this summer's introduction of redesigned MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptops. New tablets went on sale this week.

Apple said its gross margin of 43.3% was a record for the September quarter.

Maestri said the robust computer sales also reflected a backlog of orders, caused by a prolonged shutdown at one of the factories that produces Macs, which the Apple was able to fill in the quarter.

The company reported sales of iPads were $7.2 billion, compared with the average estimate of $7.94 billion.

Apple wearables such as AirPods and other accessories notched sales of $9.7 billion, slightly ahead of the Wall Street forecast of $9.2 billion.

""They said they didn’t have particular issue with supply, so that seems to be a thing of the past,"" said Creative Strategies consumer analyst Carolina Milanesi.

Growth in the company's services business, which has buoyed sales and profits in recent years, saw a rise to $19.2 billion in revenue, below the estimate of $20.10 billion.

Maestri said Apple experienced softness in digital advertising and gaming, as have others in the sector.

""Like other major tech companies, even Apple is suffering from the negative impact of a worsening macro backdrop and ongoing supply chain woes, though it has done a better job of navigating through the challenging environment,"" Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.

In China, which has experienced a sharp economic slowdown, Apple reported fourth-quarter sales of $15.5 billion. That is a gain from the prior quarter, when Apple logged sales of $14.6 billion.

Apple said it now has 900 million paying subscribers to its services, up from the previous quarter's 860 million.

530,META,2022-07-18,"Apple to slow hiring, spending for some teams next year, Bloomberg News reports","













July 18 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) plans to slow hiring and spending growth next year in some units to cope with a potential economic downturn, Bloomberg News reported on Monday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

The potential move would see Apple - the world's most valuable company - join a growing pool of American corporations including Meta Platforms (META.O) and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) in slowing hiring.

Apple shares reversed course to trade down 1.6% at $147.6. The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The Bloomberg report said the changes would not affect all teams and that Apple was still planning an aggressive product launch schedule in 2023 that includes a mixed-reality headset, its first major new category since 2015.

""Apple's move reflects a broader slowdown in investing in new things, new companies and new products,"" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh. ""It signifies that inflation is an issue for these companies.""

Fears have risen in recent months that aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to tame an unabating surge in inflation could tip the economy into a recession. The price pressures have also raised worries that customers could curb spending on discretionary items like smartphones. read more

Smartphone shipments declined 9% in the second quarter, according to data from Canalys. Still, Apple's iPhones remain among the most sold phones in the world, with the company holding a 17% market share just behind market leader Samsung, the data showed.

Apple typically launches a new version of its iPhone and other wearable products in September ahead of the busy holiday season.

As of its last annual report, the Cupertino, California-based company had about 154,000 full-time equivalent employees.

531,META,2022-09-14,"India's Byju's fiscal 2021 loss swells to $574 mln, pushes listing plans","













BENGALURU, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Tiger Global-backed Byju's on Wednesday reported a loss of 45.64 billion rupees ($574.06 million) for the 2021 fiscal year as promotion and employee expenses rose, with the edtech startup pushing listing plans to next year due to uncertain global conditions.

Byju's is reporting results for fiscal 2021 after a delay of more than 17 months.

The company's revenue dipped 3.3% to 24.28 billion rupees as it deferred about 40% of its revenue to subsequent years having adopted a new revenue recognition model, Byju's said.

Education technology was one of the few sectors that took off since the onset of the pandemic as lockdowns forced schools to shut for months together. Online learning platforms such as Byju's gained, though demand started fading with the reopening of schools and global economic uncertainty.

Gross revenue for fiscal 2022 was nearly 100 billion rupees, Byju's said, while revenue for the first four months of the current fiscal year stood at 45.30 billion rupees.

Unfavourable macroeconomic conditions also forced Byju's to push its listing plans to next year.

""We were looking for listing somewhere during this year, which now will get pushed out,"" Byju Raveendran, co-founder and chief executive, told Reuters. ""Now the timeline is end of next year, assuming the macro will improve.""

Formally called Think & Learn Pvt., Byju's would join a slate of high profile Indian IPOs after Zomato (ZOMT.NS), Nykaa (FSNE.NS) and Ant Group-backed Paytm (PAYT.NS) to go public. Indian technology companies have benefited hugely from foreign institutional inflows this year as they stood to gain from the tech crackdown in China.

Apart from Tiger Global, Byju's, founded in 2011, counts Sequoia, General Atlantic, BlackRock and Meta Platforms chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative among its investors.

JAKARTA, July 30 (Reuters) - Indonesia has blocked search engine website Yahoo, payments firm PayPal (PYPL.O) and several gaming websites due to failure to comply with licensing rules, an official said on Saturday, sparking a backlash on social media.

Registration is required under rules released in late November 2020 and will give authorities broad powers to compel platforms to disclose data of certain users, and take down content deemed unlawful or that ""disturbs public order"" within four hours if urgent and 24 hours if not. read more

Semuel Abrijani Pangerapan, a senior official at Indonesia's Communications Ministry, said in a text message websites that have been blocked include Yahoo, PayPal and gaming sites like Steam, Dota2, Counter-Strike and EpicGames, among others.

PayPal, Yahoo's parent private equity firm Apollo Global Management and U.S. game developer Valve Corporation, which runs Steam, Dota and Counter-Strike, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. EpicGames could not be reached for comment.

Hashtags like ""BlokirKominfo"" (block Communication Ministry), Epic Games and PayPal trended on Indonesian Twitter, with many writing messages criticising the government's move as hurting Indonesia's online gaming industry and freelance workers who use PayPal.

Pangerapan said the government will find a solution for people to withdraw their deposits from PayPal, which may include reopening access to its website for a short period, he told Metro TV.

Authorities would unblock the websites if they comply with registration rules, he said, defending the measure as protection for Indonesian internet users.

533,META,2022-10-27,Pinterest soars as revenue beat stands out in social media gloom,"













Oct 27 (Reuters) - Pinterest Inc (PINS.N) beat estimates for quarterly revenue on Thursday, making it a rare bright spot in an otherwise downbeat social media sector and sending the image-sharing platform's shares 15% higher in after-hours trading.

A decline in advertising budgets because of decades-high inflation has roiled earnings of online players from Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) to Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and Snap Inc . read more

But Pinterest's results show its ads business stayed resilient amid the wider industry downturn and people were still engaging with its image-sharing platform for inspiration to take up activities such as home renovation and recipe-based cooking.

Pinterest returned to user growth in the July-September period after three straight quarters of decline, with its global monthly active users rising 2.8% sequentially to 445 million, above Factset estimates of 437.4 million.

Part of the growth was fueled by an update to Apple Inc's iOS 16 in September, finance chief Todd Morgenfeld said on a call with analysts.

He added the resilience in ad sales was driven by the fact that a large portion of Pinterest's ad sales come from e-commerce and consumer goods.

""What hurt Pinterest before (during the pandemic) is helping them now,"" said D.A. Davidson analyst Thomas Forte, referring to the company's focus on retail and consumer goods.

""The bigger opportunity going forward is to find a way to drive incremental engagement on the platform and get monthly active users growing again and improve monetization since growth is slowing.""

Pinterest's third-quarter revenue rose 8% to $684.6 million. While the pace of growth was its slowest in nearly two years, the figure came in well above analysts' average estimate of $666.7 million, according to Refinitiv.

The company's global average revenue per user jumped 11% to $1.56. It earned an adjusted profit of $0.11 per share, above analyst estimates of $0.06 per share.

534,META,2022-11-09,Roblox Corp shares fall on wider-than-expected loss,"













Nov 9 (Reuters) - Roblox Corp (RBLX.N) reported a larger-than-expected quarterly loss on Wednesday, as the gaming platform spent more on hiring and its infrastructure, overshadowing solid user growth and sending its shares down 17%.

Growth has been slowing in the videogame sector this year as more people step outdoors and reserve spending for essential items in the face of the highest inflation in decades.

The company's loss ballooned to 50 cents per share in the three months ended Sept. 30, from 13 cents a year earlier. Analysts were expecting a loss of 35 cents, according to Refinitiv data.

That was mostly due to a 40% surge in total costs at Roblox that is among the key metaverse players and has a much younger audience than most major gaming companies.

The company will continue to hire but ""not quite at the same rate of hiring next year,"" said Chief Financial Officer Michael Guthrie on a call with analysts. Earlier in the day, social media giant Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) announced a 13% cut to its workforce, following similar moves by Snap Inc (SNAP.N), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Netflix Inc (NFLX.O).

Revenue grew 2% to $517.7 million in the reported quarter, and bookings were up 10% to $701.7 million.

Bookings refer to Roblox's virtual currency Robux that players buy that can be used upgrade players' avatars by buying in-game items such as clothing, pet, collectibles or accessories.

The gaming company said it changed the period of estimated paying user life to 28 months from 25 months, which resulted in a $111 million drop in revenue during the reporting quarter. It also resulted in lower costs by $25.5 million.

Average daily active users (DAUs) were 58.8 million at end of the Sept. quarter, up 24% from last year.

535,META,2023-02-03,Tech earnings hit pause button on market rally,"













Feb 3 (Reuters) - Big Tech led U.S. markets on a sharp rebound to kick off 2023. The message from their earnings on Thursday: not so fast.

Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) all posted results for the end-of-year quarter that left a sour taste in investors' mouths. The reports renewed questions about global economic demand, the effect of higher interest rates and whether the market's January rally got ahead of itself.

Nascent signs that consumer spending was beginning to rebound in China were not enough to change that.

Apple, the world's largest publicly traded company, fell short of expectations, hurt by lower iPhone sales and production disruptions in China. Amazon said operating profits could fall this quarter due to lower demand, and Alphabet's online advertisers cut back their spend as well.

Shares of Amazon dropped about 5%, while Alphabet retreated nearly 2%, on course to collectively shed nearly $93 billion from their respectively market valuations. Apple reversed early losses to trade 3.5% higher.

""Maybe the tech stocks rallied a little bit too much into these numbers, so the market will be taking a deep breath and saying, 'OK, well these companies aren't bulletproof,'"" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta, Georgia.

These three firms and Microsoft (MSFT.O), the four U.S. companies with trillion-dollar market values, have led the broad-market S&P 500 in 2023. The index is up nearly 9% year-to-date, with Amazon gaining 34%. Big Tech surged Thursday following a strong quarterly report from Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O).

That's after the group was battered throughout 2022, trailing the S&P, which dropped nearly 20%.

David Trainer, chief executive of New Constructs in Nashville, Tennessee, said not enough people in the market are paying attention to company fundamentals.

""We're in a speculator's market, not an investor's,"" he said, noting recent trading in retailer Bed Bath & Beyond, which is expected to file for bankruptcy soon. ""What we've seen in January and late December was a huge increase in liquidity and a return to the meme stock way.""

Some investors saw silver linings from Apple and other bellwethers, including Starbucks, that reported results on Thursday. They noted that lockdowns in China strangled sales for many companies in the world's second-biggest economy, expecting a rebound in the coming year.

""When things started to reopen in December (in China), we did see an increase in traffic to our stores as compared to November and an increase in demand as December rolled around,"" Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters.

Cook said lockdowns in China hurt both production and demand, and the company faced headwinds from the strong U.S. dollar that pushed revenues lower.

""Currency was a headwind but will be a tailwind in Q1,” said Nancy Tengler, chief executive of Laffer Tengler Investments in Scottsdale, Arizona, referring to the dollar's weakening trajectory.

""The supply chain was a problem more so than demand, and that seems to have been right-sized.""

Similarly, Starbucks said comparable sales fell 29% from the previous year in China, the company's fastest-growing market, but that beginning in January, it saw ""very encouraging"" recovery momentum there.

Other U.S. consumer bellwethers painted a mixed picture. Consumer staples giant Clorox said product volumes fell in three of the company's four business segments in the fourth quarter, while automaker Ford said the year ahead was going to be a difficult one.

They, and other companies, are still grappling with higher interest rates that are slowing demand. This year's surge in stocks has been built on a rally in bonds, as lower yields make high-valuation shares more attractive. Cost-cutting by Alphabet and Meta led some investors to think that interest rates are affecting demand.

""In many respects we're waiting for that other shoe to drop – the impact of higher rates on the economy, inflation, earnings and jobs,"" said Jack Ablin, co-founder and chief investment officer at Cresset Capital, which manages $30 billion. ""Profits tend to trough nine months after overnight rates peak and we haven't even seen the peak in overnight rates yet.""

536,META,2022-07-14,TikTok maker ByteDance takes aim at lifestyle leader Xiaohongshu with new app,"













BEIJING, July 14 (Reuters) - TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance is looking for its next big hit by wading deeper into the lifestyle sector of social media with Kesong, a shopping and lifestyle recommendations app similar to market leader Xiaohongshu.

Kesong, launched last week, allows users to share photos, videos and write-ups of fashion tips and shopping experiences.

It emulates Xiaohongshu, often likened to Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) Instagram and which is widely considered the embodiment of ""planting grass"" - the notion that reviews can entice readers or followers to buy a product or service.

Fashion and luxury brands often turn to Xiaohongshu's influencers who can reach millions of affluent users in China. Overseas, Xiaohongshu is known as Red in countries including Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, Canada and the United States.

Hardware and software maker ByteDance was valued at around $300 billion in recent trades and has become known as something of an app factory. It has produced a string of hits from news aggregator Toutiao to short video app Douyin and its overseas equivalent TikTok, China's most successful app abroad.

It tried its hand at a ""planting grass"" app in 2018 with the short-lived Xincao. It tried again in 2020 with Sharee, aimed at overseas markets. Later renamed Lemon8, the app has over a million downloads in Japan and has expanded into Thailand.

Lemon8 is exploring the possibility of expanding into Australia, two people at the company told Reuters.

The app is overseen by Alex Zhu, senior vice president of product and strategy at ByteDance and formerly TikTok head, the two people said, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media.

""ByteDance is very determined to crack the 'high-brow' market (with Kesong and Lemon8) to achieve a higher ARPU,"" one of the people said, referring to average revenue per user.

ByteDance did not respond to a request for comment.

537,META,2022-09-01,Twitter will roll out long-awaited edit button to paid subscribers,"













Sept 1 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc (TWTR.N)will launch a widely requested edit button for its paid subscribers in the coming weeks, the social media company said Thursday.

For years, Twitter users have demanded the ability to edit their tweets after publishing in order to fix errors like typos. Those requests have led to jokes online that Twitter would rather introduce any other product, such as newsletters, before giving users their top-requested feature.

Subscribers who pay $4.99 per month for Twitter Blue will soon be able to edit their tweets ""a few times"" within 30 minutes of publication, Twitter said in a blog post.

Nearly every other social media platform, including Meta Platform's Facebook and Instagram, Reddit and Pinterest, have for years offered features allowing users to edit posts.

The San Francisco-based company is embroiled in a legal fight with billionaire Elon Musk, who is trying to back out of a $44-billion agreement to buy Twitter.

In April, on the same day that Musk disclosed a 9% stake in Twitter, he tweeted a poll asking his millions of followers whether they wanted an edit button. Over 70% said yes.

Twitter and its observers have debated whether allowing tweets to be edited could lead to harmful effects, such as the spread of misinformation.

Edited tweets will have an icon and timestamp to display when the post was last edited. Users will be able to click on the label of an edited tweet to view the edit history and previous versions of the post.

Twitter has experimented with versions of an edit button. Subscribers of Twitter Blue, the company's paid subscription product, currently have access to a feature that holds tweets for up to one minute, allowing users to review the tweet and ""undo"" it before the post is published.

Asked if the edit button would eventually be available for all Twitter users, a spokeswoman said Twitter was testing the feature to ""anticipate what might happen if we bring it to everyone.""

Sputnik/Alexander Astafyev/Pool via REUTERS















April 9 (Reuters) - YouTube has blocked Duma TV which broadcasts from Russia's lower house of parliament, drawing an angry response from officials who said the world's most popular streaming service could face restrictions in response.

On Saturday, a message on YouTube said the Duma channel had been ""terminated for a violation of YouTube's Terms of Service"".

YouTube, owned by Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O), has been under pressure from Russian communications regulator Roskomnadzor and officials were quick to respond.

""From the look of it, YouTube has signed its own warrant. Save content, transfer (it) to Russian platforms. And hurry up,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on the Telegram messaging service.

The communications watchdog said it had requested Google restore access to the Duma channel immediately.

""The American IT company adheres to a pronounced anti-Russian position in the information war unleashed by the West against our country,"" Roskomnadzor said.

Google told Reuters in an emailed comment that is was committed to compliance with all applicable sanctions and trade compliance laws.

""If we find that an account violates our Terms of Service, we take appropriate action. Our teams are closely monitoring the situation for any updates and changes.""

Vyacheslav Volodin, the Duma's speaker, said YouTube's move was further proof of rights and freedom violations by Washington.

""The USA wants to obtain a monopoly on promoting information. We cannot let it happen,"" Volodin said on Telegram.

Russia has already restricted access to Twitter (TWTR.N) and Meta Platforms' (FB.O) flagships Facebook and Instagram since sending thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Russia had earlier tried to ban the Telegram messaging app, now widely used by officials, but lifted its ban in mid-2020.

Some Russian media cast the move as a capitulation, but Roskomnadzor said it had acted as it did because the app's Russian founder, Pavel Durov, was prepared to cooperate in combating terrorism and extremism on the platform.

REUTERS/Marco Bello/File Photo















Aug 19 (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic lawmakers on Friday asked social media platforms to turn over data regarding an increase in online threats aimed at law enforcement following a search of former President Donald Trump's Florida home and asked how they planned to respond.

House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and Stephen Lynch, Chairman of the Subcommittee on National Security, urged chief executives to act fast in letters addressed to eight internet companies, including Facebook-parent Meta Platforms Inc. (META.O), Twitter Inc. (TWTR.N) and TikTok.

The requests come more than a week after a Columbus man was shot dead in a standoff with police after he tried to breach an FBI building in Ohio. Last week the FBI and U.S Department of Homeland Security alerted law enforcement agencies of an increase in threats.

The Democrats want to know if the uptick in online threats was linked to what they described as ""reckless statements"" issued by Trump and Republicans condemning the search.

""We urge you to take immediate action to address any threats of violence against law enforcement that appear on your

company's platforms,"" the lawmakers said in the letters.

Letters were also made out to the Trump-backed platform Truth Social, Rumble, Gettr, Telegram and Gab.

In addition to information about the companies' response to the online threats, the House panel also asked for their plans to minimize users' ability to incite violence.

Lawmakers said they would consider proposing legislation to protect law officers and improve coordination with federal agencies.

The FBI has been the subject of online threats since its agents searched Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate last week as part of an investigation into documents removed from the White House when Trump left office in January 2021. Agents removed 11 sets of classified records from the resort in Palm Beach, including some labeled ""top secret"" for the most sensitive U.S. national security information.

540,META,2022-11-18,Jaguar Land Rover turns to laid-off tech workers for EV skills,"













LONDON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Laid off tech workers could find new jobs at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) as the 100-year-old British automaker looks to hire hundreds of engineers to help develop electric cars.

JLR, which is owned by India's Tata Motors (TAMO.NS), on Friday announced a jobs portal for displaced tech workers to fill 800 roles spanning self-driving, electrification, machine learning and data science.

The luxury carmaker, which wants to become an ""electric-first"" business from 2025, said it believed workers leaving big tech groups like Amazon (AMZN.O) were most likely to have the required skills to fill new roles in Britain, Ireland, the United States, India, China and Hungary.

The majority of the jobs will be in Britain and split between JLR's offices in Manchester and Gaydon in central England, Chief Information Officer Anthony Battle said.

""We've had vacancies there for quite a long time. Some of the capabilities are quite difficult to fill because it's a very competitive market, particularly software engineers and architects,"" Battle said in an online video interview.

""It's fortuitous for us, and definitely others, that there is now this huge availability of talent at a time when we'd already planned to move forward.""

The hiring drive comes after thousands of layoffs in recent weeks at U.S. tech firms including Twitter, Meta (META.O) and Amazon, some of which have offices in London and Dublin.

The new jobs, particularly in artificial intelligence and machine learning, will support the company's data collection efforts through which it gains insights on car performance and customer behaviour, Battle said.

JLR last year announced an electrification strategy under which all Jaguar cars would be fully electric by 2024 and an electric option would be offered across its entire portfolio including Land Rover.

541,META,2022-08-15,"'Big Short' fund manager Burry dumps portfolio, buys prison stock","













NEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Scion Asset Management fund manager Michael Burry, who rose to fame with timely bets against housing ahead of the 2008 financial crisis, in the last quarter dumped a dozen bullish positions and replaced them with a new stake in prison company Geo Group Inc (GEO.N), according to filings released on Monday.

Shares of Geo Group rose 12% on Monday, the largest one-day rally in the company since June 2021, according to Refinitv data. At current prices, Burry's position is worth approximately $3.9 million. Shares of the company, which has a market value of $852 million, are down 1.6% for the year to date.

Burry, who frequently deletes his tweets, suggested on Twitter on Sunday that the 18% gain in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index (.IXIC) since the start of the third quarter is likely to reverse.

""Can't shake that silly pre-Enron, pre-9/11, pre-WorldCom feeling,"" he wrote, referring to three events which contributed to an approximately 75% decline in the Nasdaq between February 2000 and September 2002.

Filings known as 13-f are one of the few quarterly disclosures that hedge fund managers make of their long positions -- bets that a stock will rise -- and may not reflect current holdings. Fund managers are not required to disclose short positions, which profit when a company's shares fall.

Among the stocks that Burry sold are a stake in Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META.O) that was worth $12.9 million at the end of the quarter, a $19.7 million stake in Cigna Corp (CI.N), and a $23.1 million stake in Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N).

The Nasdaq Composite was recently up 0.43% Monday, leaving it down 16.3% for the year to date.

542,META,2022-04-13,US group says finds Facebook posts offering endangered wildlife for sale,"













SHANGHAI, April 13 (Reuters) - Facebook has become a ""thriving marketplace"" for illegal online wildlife trading, allowing the sale of many critically endangered species, a report by the U.S.-based campaign group Avaaz said on Wednesday.

Avaaz researchers said an investigation into the social media platform uncovered 129 posts listing endangered species that were up for sale, including baby tigers, African grey parrots and the pygmy marmoset, the world's smallest monkey.

""Avaaz's research shows that, on Facebook, wildlife trafficking takes place in broad daylight,"" said Ruth Delbaere, senior legal campaigner with Avaaz.

""By insufficiently enforcing its own policies, Facebook is enabling an international trade that has devastating effects on biodiversity and the stability of natural ecosystems,"" Delbaere added.

Facebook's guidelines prohibit content that seeks to buy, sell, trade, donate or gift endangered species or their parts.

A spokesperson for Facebook owner Meta (FB.O) told Reuters that it was unfair to judge the company's enforcement efforts on the basis of just 129 posts and said it has removed pages that violate its policies.

""The results don't reflect the extensive work we've done to combat wildlife trafficking on Facebook,"" the spokesperson said, adding that the company has introduced technology to find and remove such content, and to warn users who search for it.

""This is an adversarial space though, and the people behind this awful activity are persistent and constantly evolving their tactics to try to evade those efforts,"" the spokesperson said.

Illegal wildlife trafficking has been under the spotlight amid claims that the virus that causes COVID-19 might have crossed the species barrier from bats to humans via China's extensive animal trading network.

Since early 2020, China has sought to crack down on the trading of all kinds of wildlife for food.

China's Supreme Court also issued new guidelines last week saying legal efforts to combat trafficking should cover the entire criminal supply chain, from poaching to processing.

543,META,2022-10-13,David Ellison's Skydance Media raises $400 million,"













Oct 13 (Reuters) - Skydance Media, the studio behind such films and television series as ""The Adam Project"" and ""Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan"", on Thursday announced it has completed a $400 million investment round led by the global investment firm KKR & Co (KKR.N) and the Ellison family.

The independent studio, founded in 2010 by David Ellison, son of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, has been gathering momentum in Hollywood, as a financial backer and producer of Paramount Pictures' (PARA.O) summer blockbuster, ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" and producer of such long-running streaming series as Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) ""Reacher"" and Netflix Inc's (NFLX.O) ""Grace and Frankie.""

Skydance has expanded its entertainment portfolio in recent years. It released its first animated film, ""Luck,"" this summer, from an in-house studio led by Pixar Animation Studios co-founder John Lasseter, and showed off a teaser for a new game called ""Behemoth"" at an event this week where Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) unveiled its virtual reality headset, the Quest Pro.

The studio also hired Mandalay Sports Media executive Jon Weinbach, who produced the 2020 sports documentary ""The Last Dance,"" about Michael Jordan's final season with the Chicago Bulls, to head its sports division.

""All the capital is being used to fund our future growth and our emerging businesses,"" Ellison told Reuters.

KKR is viewed as a strategic investor, having taken stakes in such media and sports businesses as German publisher Axel Springer SE , TikTok parent ByteDance Ltd, Fortnite creator Epic Games and the sports wagering company FanDuel Inc.

The funding round also includes backing from existing investors RedBird Capital Partners and Tencent Holdings Limited (0700.HK) and values Skydance at over $4 billion.

544,META,2022-12-12,Irish multinational jobs growth up 43% y/y as tech cuts begin,"Summary

Summary Companies Foreign companies employ 12% of entire workforce

Record job gain does not include many recent tech cuts

Companies will be ""much more cautious"" in 2023















DUBLIN, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Foreign-owned multinationals in Ireland added a record number of jobs in the year to end October, up 43% on last year's previous high as the state investment agency forecast slower growth for 2023 as some large tech companies let staff go.

Ireland is hugely reliant on foreign companies whose total number of employees have almost doubled in the last decade to 301,000, or 12% of the entire workforce. They also pay a large chunk of the country's income and corporate taxes.

A net job gain of just over 24,000 included 8,407 job losses, down on last year's 12,231.

IDA Ireland said this did not include many of the local layoffs tech firms including Facebook parent Meta (META.O), Twitter and Stripe have announced recently as part of global cutbacks.

IDA Ireland Interim CEO Mary Buckley said she expected that tech firms may cut some more jobs next year but that the sector would continue to grow in the future.

While a positive pipeline of investments are lined up across other sectors for the first half of 2023, the severe headwinds facing the global economy means companies are going to be ""much more cautious"" next year, Buckley added.

""So slower growth is likely in 2023 with less clarity in the second half of next year,"" she said.

Some of Ireland's largest multinational employers were among the 242 firms that added jobs, including Apple (AAPL.O), TikTok, Dell (DELL.N), IBM (IBM.N), Citi (C.N), Abbott (ABT.N), Pfizer (PFE.N) and Workday .

Almost half of the companies that created news jobs invested in Ireland for the first time.

545,META,2022-10-28,Analysis: Tech wreck shows U.S. megacaps not immune to corrosive Fed tightening,"













NEW YORK, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Disappointing earnings from the megacap companies that led markets higher for years are cratering their shares and sending a disconcerting message about a U.S. economy that until recently had appeared to be weathering a barrage of interest rate hikes.

Amazon (AMZN.O) was the latest corporate giant to deliver bad news, saying on Thursday that costs might eviscerate profits in the current quarter. Its shares fell 17% in extended trading, wiping $190 billion from its market capitalization.

Amazon's report was the latest worrying announcement from the big tech-focused companies that command outsized weightings in stock indexes and are nearly ubiquitous in investor portfolios.

""From a markets perspective, you have to be cautious going forward,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. ""They're the biggest stocks in the market, and we really haven't had much of anything good come out of any of them.""

Facebook parent Meta Platforms' (META.O) shares were pummeled Thursday after its costly metaverse bets disappointed investors. Earlier in the week, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) missed Wall Street's target for revenue growth in the third quarter as ad sales remained weak, while inflation and a strong dollar led Microsoft (MSFT.O) to report its slowest topline growth in five years.

Even Apple (AAPL.O), whose revenues and profits topped Wall Street targets, on Thursday reported weaker iPhone sales than some analysts had expected.

As of Thursday's close, only Apple's shares - which are down around 18% for the year - have outperformed the 20% year-to-date loss in the S&P 500 . Meta leads the declines with a fall of some 70%.

tech wreck

Many view the growth giants as bellwethers for how corporate America is faring during a year in which inflation has soared, pushing the Federal Reserve to enact a series of jumbo-sized rate hikes that have bruised markets and raised fears of a looming recession.

Their disappointing results suggest that even the strongest U.S. companies are feeling the effects of tighter Fed policy, a soaring dollar and persistent inflation.

The selloff in megacap shares ""indicates that the Fed's restrictive policy is beginning to be felt in the real economy, with growth slowing meaningfully,"" said Daniel Krieter, a strategist at BMO Capital Markets. ""Now we wait to find out if the Fed can achieve a soft landing. It will be very difficult.""

The Fed has already raised rates by 300 basis points this year as it fights the worst inflation in decades. Investors are bracing for another 75 basis point increase at next week's monetary policy meeting, though hopes that Fed officials may soon slow the pace of tightening have buoyed stocks in October.

""Big tech companies are not impervious to slowdowns in the economy, particularly if they are consumer driven,"" said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.

""As the Fed embarks on this planned slowdown, it is eating away at some of their consumer-faced businesses and given their high multiples it is causing big contractions in their stock prices,"" he said.

ERODING PROFITS

Resilient corporate profits have been one bright spot in an otherwise gloomy year, although the recent disappointing results are fueling doubts over how long this can last.

Based on results from 227 of the S&P 500 companies as of Thursday morning and estimates for the remainder, third-quarter earnings are now projected to have risen just 2.5% compared with an estimated gain of 4.5% on Oct. 1, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

""The big technology companies like Amazon continued hiring to support a business that looks like the year 2021, and it's not 2021. It's 2022,"" said Kim Forrest, Chief Investment Officer At Bokeh Capital Partners. ""Layer on top of this inflation. People are buying less stuff.""

Despite the big stock price drops, some investors see more pain for the big tech-focused names.

In a Thursday morning report, analysts at UBS Global Wealth Management gave a litany of reasons for caution, including still-high earnings estimates given elevated inflation and the stronger dollar.

""Even after a significant underperformance by tech stocks so far this year ... we don't believe the continuing headwinds for the sector are yet fully priced into the market,"" they wrote.

NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority plans to increase its resources to understand and monitor cryptocurrencies as more of the Wall Street watchdog's members trade digital assets, Chief Executive Officer Robert Cook said on Tuesday.

""We are already having to be engaged in the space and we think that as a result it's appropriate for us to bulk up our capabilities there,"" Cook said at a trading industry conference.

FINRA has several dozen members that have been approved to trade digital asset securities, as well as members who allow customers to access crypto products, and members with registered representatives who have outside business activities around crypto, Cook said.

The regulator is also developing digital asset verification techniques and is looking at whether it can do cross market surveillance on various blockchains, he said.

Cryptocurrencies prices have dropped sharply in recent weeks, with bitcoin hitting an 18-month low on Tuesday after major crypto lender Celsius Network froze withdrawals and the prospect of sharp U.S. interest rate rises shook the volatile asset class.

Crypto exchange Coinbase Global Inc (COIN.O)said on Tuesday it will cut about 1,100 jobs, or 18% of its workforce to ride out the downturn in the cryptosphere. Companies like BlockFi and Crypto.com have also slashed hundreds of jobs, while top firms including Meta Platforms and Intel Corp (INTC.O) have tapped the brakes on hiring. read more

While federal agencies jockey for position to be the primary regulator for digital assets, regardless of the outcome, FINRA will most likely have a role to play, Cook said.

""We're going to need to be engaged and prepared to have the resources to do that, so anybody who is getting laid off from a crypto platform and wants to work for FINRA, give me a call,"" he said.

547,META,2023-02-02,Alphabet disappoints on sales as ad business slips after pandemic run-up,"













Feb 2 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) on Thursday posted fourth-quarter profit and sales short of Wall Street expectations as Google's advertising clients pulled back spending from a period of pandemic-led excess.

Executives of the search and advertising giant adopted a subdued tone on a call with investors, promising an extended period of belt-tightening, particularly on hiring, real estate costs and experimental projects that can take years to reach fruition.

Shares of Alphabet were down nearly 5% in after-hours trading, after losing about 40% of their value in 2022.

""We are committed to investing responsibly with great discipline and defining areas where we can operate more cost- effectively,"" Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts on a call to discuss the company's results. That echoed comments from Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) boss Mark Zuckerberg the previous day on cost efficiencies.

Shares of other tech companies Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) also fell after they posted disappointing results on Thursday, wiping off gains after Facebook parent Meta on Wednesday boosted tech shares with news on cost cuts and a large buyback.

Gone was some of the exuberance of the pandemic when consumers flocked to the internet amid lockdowns and heightened interest in e-commerce and touchless deliveries.

Alphabet's chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, promised a more measured approach for 2023 and a focus on ""delivering sustainable financial value,"" not necessarily a hallmark of Silicon Valley firms. ""We're focused on revenue upside as well as durable changes to the expense base.""

Advertisers, who contribute the bulk of Alphabet's sales, have cut their budgets as rising inflation and interest rates fueled concern over consumer spending.

Pichai pointed to advertisers' more modest spending and the impact of foreign exchange rates abroad as drags on Alphabet's overall results.

He said artificial intelligence (AI) software will be an important focus for the company and that it plans to make its LaMDA chatbot software publicly available in the coming weeks.

LID ON COSTS

Mountain View, California-based Alphabet decided to cut 12,000 jobs last month, representing about 6% of its overall workforce, and said it was doubling down on AI. Across the company, Alphabet will ""meaningfully"" slow its pace of hiring this year, said Porat.

Alphabet, long a leader in AI, is facing competition from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), which is reportedly looking to boost its stake in ChatGPT - a promising chatbot that answers queries with human-like responses.

""Despite being seen as one of the most insulated companies in the advertising space relative to peers, Alphabet's poor quarter is the latest sign that worsening fundamentals and a tough macroeconomic environment are prompting advertisers to cut back on spending,"" said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.

Net income fell to $13.62 billion, or $1.05 per share, from $20.64 billion, or $1.53 per share, a year earlier. That was the sharpest decline for Alphabet in four quarters.

Adjusted profit of $1.05 per share fell short of an expected $1.18 per share, according to Refinitiv.

Revenue from Google advertising, which includes Search and YouTube, fell 3.6% to $59.04 billion. Total revenue rose 1% to $76.05 billion, its slowest growth ever barring a small decline in the second quarter of 2020. Analysts were expecting $76.53 billion.

Google is the world's largest digital ad platform by market share, making it uniquely susceptible to fluctuations in online marketing spending. Its YouTube division has faced a surge in rival platforms, particularly TikTok, whose endless scroll of short video is drawing younger users away.

Alphabet's Porat said the company's total capital expenses this year will be in line with last year. As more of its employees work remotely and it consolidates staff, Alphabet expects to pare back its real estate expenses, which Porat said would result in a charge of roughly a half-billion dollars in this year's first three months.

Revenue from YouTube ads, one of Alphabet's most consistent money-makers, fell nearly 8% to $7.96 billion, well below the estimate of $8.25 billion, according to FactSet.

Cloud was a bright spot, however, with revenue growing 32% to $7.32 billion, but at its slowest pace since the company began disclosing the segment's revenue numbers.

But there may be more pain ahead for Alphabet. Late last month, the Justice Department and eight states sued Google over what they said were anticompetitive practices in its digital ad sales. The company is facing multiple lawsuits, which, if successful, could cause it to be broken up.

548,META,2022-03-20,Brazil high court revokes Telegram suspension after it blocks disinformation accounts,"













SAO PAULO, March 20 (Reuters) - Brazil's Supreme Court revoked on Sunday an order suspending the use of messaging app Telegram in the country after the company complied with court requests to block accounts that allegedly spread disinformation, according to a statement on the court's website.

On Friday, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered the suspension, saying Telegram had repeatedly refused to adhere to judicial orders to freeze accounts spreading fake news or comply with the country's laws. read more

Telegram founder Pavel Durov responded by apologizing for the company's ""negligence"" in replying to court orders.

Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro and his supporters have increasingly relied upon Telegram as a form of mass communication as larger tech companies like Meta (FB.O), which owns messaging app WhatsApp, Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Twitter (TWTR.N) have adhered to Supreme Court orders to drop offending accounts over allegedly spreading disinformation.

Moraes had given a Sunday deadline for Telegram to comply with its orders, including freezing accounts belonging to Allan dos Santos, an activist linked to Bolsonaro.

In the Supreme Court statement, Moraes said Telegram had shown ""full compliance.""

""I revoke the decision of complete suspension of the operation of Telegram in Brazil,"" he added.

Telegram has appointed Alan Campos Elias Thomaz as its legal representative in Brazil, the court statement said, fulfilling a key request.

Moraes' move further stoked debate about freedom of speech in politically polarized Brazil in the latest chapter in the crusading justice's battle with Bolsonaro and his allies.

The justice has been leading a series of Supreme Court investigations into Bolsonaro and his supporters for disseminating fake news - probes that have enraged many on the right and raised questions about judicial overreach.

Bolsonaro had decried the suspension as ""inadmissible.""

549,META,2022-11-15,China's Tencent starts new round of layoffs -sources,"













SHENZHEN, China/HONG KONG, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) has begun a new round of job cuts targeted at its video streaming, gaming and cloud businesses, four sources close to the matter said.

The sources said the layoffs affect three out of Tencent's six business divisions - platform and content (PCG), which comprises of its video and news platforms, its gaming-focused interactive entertainment department (IEG) and cloud and smart industries group (CSIG).

Two of the sources said some staff in IEG were informed last week they were being laid off.

Tencent declined to comment.

Reuters was not able to establish the scale of the job losses.

China's technology sector continues to feel the effects of a regulatory crackdown and headwinds from zero-COVID measures that have slowed the broader economy.

Tencent already cut jobs earlier this year, alongside peers, including Alibaba Group (9988.HK) and smaller Chinese tech companies such as Xiaohongshu. In August, Tencent disclosed its employee numbers fell to 110,715 by the end of June from 116,213 in March.

Refintiv data shows analysts expect Tencent to report flat revenues or a small contraction on Wednesday, when it publishes third-quarter results.

Tencent management have said they are focused on cutting costs and have shuttered non-core businesses in certain areas, including online education, e-commerce and game live-streaming.

The Shenzhen-based company is eyeing global expansion to offset slowing growth in China. Reuters reported last month Tencent is resetting its M&A strategy to put more focus on buying majority stakes mainly in overseas gaming companies.

Several U.S. tech employers, including Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Twitter have also laid off thousands of workers in recent weeks.

550,META,2022-07-28,EXCLUSIVE EU mulls new unit with antitrust veterans to enforce tech rules - sources,"













BRUSSELS, July 28 (Reuters) - The European Commission is considering creating a new directorate that may be headed by two top antitrust officials to enforce tough new rules aimed at reining in the powers of Big Tech, two people familiar with the matter said.

Such a move could ease concerns that the EU competition watchdog may struggle to get technology giants such as Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Meta and Microsoft (MSFT.O) to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). read more

The landmark rules, agreed in March, will go into force next year. They will bar the companies from setting their own products as preferences, forcing app developers to use their payment systems, and leveraging users' data to push competing services.

The new directorate at the Commission's powerful antitrust arm may be headed by Alberto Bacchiega, director of information, communication and media, in charge of antitrust and merger cases involving the tech, media and consumer electronics industries, one of the people said.

Bacchiega could also be assisted by Thomas Kramler, head of the unit dealing with antitrust cases in e-commerce and data economy, and currently spearheading investigations into Apple and Amazon, the person said.

Both officials are already liasing with those at the Commission's Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology which will jointly enforce the DMA, a third person said.

Bacchiega and Kramler could not be reached for comment as they are away on their summer holiday.

The EU executive said it was organising itself internally so that it can enforce the DMA effectively.

""The enforcement of the DMA is estimated to require approximately 80 staff who would be redeployed internally, as appropriate,"" a spokeswoman said.

""The internal organisation will be based on the relevant expertise of all DGs (directorate-generals) and services involved, and ensure appropriate staffing of the relevant DGs and services,"" she said.

551,META,2022-11-15,"Investor TCI urges Alphabet to cut excessive headcount, costs","













Nov 15 (Reuters) - Activist investor TCI Fund Management has called on Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) to cut costs by lowering its headcount and reduce losses in its self-driving unit Waymo, saying the Google parent needs to adjust to an era of slower growth.

The fund, an investor in Alphabet since 2017 with a $6 billion stake, said the company had ""too many employees and cost per employee is too high"".

TCI said Alphabet pays some of the highest salaries in Silicon Valley, noting that the company has increased headcount by 20% annually since 2017 and more than doubled it since then.

Alphabet did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Shares of Alphabet, which has a market capitalization of $1.24 trillion, were up nearly 5% in mid-day trading.

Many tech companies including Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) are lately making deep cuts to their employee base as part of its restructuring efforts to navigate a potential downturn in the economy, after years of rapid hiring.

Alphabet, which is also struggling with advertisers cutting back on spending, said in late October that it plans to cut hiring by more than half.

""Cost discipline is now required as revenue growth is slowing. Cost growth above revenue growth is a sign of poor financial discipline,"" the fund said in the letter to Alphabet's management and board.

TCI also called on Alphabet to disclose operating profit margin targets and reduce losses in Other Bets, the unit that includes Waymo and other special projects.

Investments into Waymo were not justified and losses should be reduced ""dramatically,"" TCI said, adding that the autonomous vehicle technology unit has generated $3 billion but recorded operating losses of $20 billion so far. TCI demanded the unit reduce operating losses by at least 50%.

552,META,2022-04-06,HSBC launches metaverse portfolio for wealthy Asian clients,"













SINGAPORE, April 6 (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings has launched a fund to capture investment opportunities in the metaverse for its rich clients in Hong Kong and Singapore as financial services companies tap into Silicon Valley's new virtual reality.

In a statement on Wednesday, HSBC said its Metaverse Discretionary Strategy portfolio, managed by its asset management arm, will focus on investing within the metaverse ecosystem across five segments - infrastructure, computing, virtualisation, experience and discovery, and interface.

""The metaverse ecosystem, while still at its early stage, is rapidly evolving,"" said Lina Lim, regional head of discretionary and funds for investments and wealth solutions, Asia Pacific, at HSBC. ""We see many exciting opportunities in this space as companies of different backgrounds and sizes are flocking into the ecosystem.""

The metaverse comprises a network of virtual environments accessed via different devices where users can work, socialise and play. It has come into sharper focus since Facebook (FB.O) changed its name to Meta last year to reflect its bet on the sector.

HSBC said its discretionary portfolio was designed for its high net worth and ultra-high net worth professional investors and accredited investor clients in Hong Kong and Singapore.

Last month, HSBC said it was buying a plot of virtual real estate in an online gaming space, becoming the second global bank to invest in a popular metaverse platform after JPMorgan (JPM.N) set up a presence in blockchain-based Decentraland. read more

HSBC is putting $3.5 billion into its wealth and personal banking business, in line with its ambition to become Asia's top wealth manager by 2025.

Global wealth managers, including UBS (UBSG.S) and Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), have been ramping up headcount in Asia as countries such as China and India minted more billionaires and millionaires.

Summary Companies Metaverse could enable existing crimes, take them to new level

Child safety issues a concern as well, says Interpol's Oberoi

Virtual reality could facilitate crimes like terror attacks















LONDON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - (This October 27 story has been refiled to remove extraneous letter from the headline)

Global police agency Interpol said it was preparing for the risk that online immersive environments - the ""metaverse"" - could create new kinds of cybercrime and allow existing crime to take place on a larger scale.

Interpol's member countries have raised concerns about how to prepare for possible metaverse crime, Madan Oberoi, Interpol's executive director for technology and innovation, told Reuters.

""Some of the crimes may be new to this medium, some of the existing crimes will be enabled by the medium and taken to a new level,"" he said.

Phishing and scams could operate differently when augmented reality and virtual reality are involved, Oberoi said. Child safety issues were also a concern, he said.

Virtual reality could also facilitate crime in the physical world, Oberoi said.

""If terror group wants to attack a physical space they may use this space to plan and simulate and launch their exercises before attacking,"" he said.

Earlier this month, the European Union's law enforcement agency Europol said in a report that terror groups may, in the future, use virtual worlds for propaganda, recruitment and training. Users may also create virtual worlds with ""extremist rules,"" the report said.

If metaverse environments record users' interactions on blockchain, ""this might make it possible to follow everything someone does based on one interaction with them - providing valuable information for stalkers or extortionists,"" Europol said.

The metaverse became a tech buzzword in 2021, with companies and investors betting that virtual world environments will grow in popularity and mark a new stage in the internet's development. Facebook announced it was changing its name to Meta in October 2021 to mark its shift towards this idea.

But so far, this vision shows little signs of materialising. Meta's stock value plunged on Thursday as investors voiced skepticism about spending on metaverse bets. Sales of blockchain-based assets representing virtual land and other digital possessions have also fallen sharply after a period of frenetic growth last year.

Summary Companies Revenue jumps 18% on retail advertising strength

Shares rally 9% in extended trading

Ukraine conflict weighs on Q2 outlook















April 27 (Reuters) - Pinterest Inc's (PINS.N) first-quarter revenue and profit surpassed market estimates on Wednesday as the image-sharing platform benefited from higher ad spending by businesses, sending its shares 9% higher in extended trading.

Like its peers, Pinterest posted strong user growth in the early months of the pandemic as home-bound consumers sought projects to keep themselves entertained. But that boom has faded with the easing of lockdowns, prompting the company to double down on efforts to grow its ad business.

Revenue rose 18% in the first three months of the year to $575 million, driven by strength in the retail advertising and international businesses. Analysts on average were expecting a figure of $572.5 million, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

""We benefited significantly from strength in retail. And I would imagine that based on what we're seeing that, that will continue,"" Chief Financial Officer Todd Morgenfeld said on a post-earnings call.

Company executives also pointed to user growth in the younger demographic, especially Gen Z.

While the company's overall monthly active users (MAUs) declined 9% to 433 million, it posted a rise in mobile app MAUs, the group which accounts for most its revenue.

UKRAINE CONFLICT IMPACT

Pinterest's 11% revenue growth projection for the second quarter was, however, below market expectations. The company blamed the weakness on the Ukraine crisis, echoing commentary from larger peer Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O). read more

Recent earnings reports from Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Snap Inc (SNAP.N) have also highlighted the impact of the Ukraine conflict on digital ad spending. read more

On an adjusted basis, Pinterest earned 10 cents per share in the first quarter, exceeding Wall Street estimates of 4 cents per share.

555,META,2022-11-30,Salesforce's co-CEO Taylor to leave as Benioff takes sole charge,"













Nov 30 (Reuters) - Salesforce Inc (CRM.N) said on Wednesday that Bret Taylor would step down as co-chief executive officer in January and that co-founder Marc Benioff will become the sole CEO.

The news sent the company's shares down 7% in extended trading as investors shrugged off the annual profit raise.

Investors likely assumed that Taylor's appointment was the beginning of a long tenure as the operational CEO at Salesforce, said Steve Koenig, managing director at SMBC Nikko Securities.

""His departure raises questions about why he's leaving and how operational leadership will be divided and delegated,"" he added.

Taylor, who previously served as chief operating officer and chief product officer of Salesforce, became the co-CEO in November 2021.

He was a key driving force behind Salesforce's $27.7 billion takeover of workspace messaging platform Slack Technologies.

""After a lot of reflection, I've decided to return to my entrepreneurial roots,"" Taylor said.

A co-creator of Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google Maps, Taylor is also credited with devising Meta Platform Inc (META.O) unit Facebook's ""like"" button as the social media giant's chief technology officer.

The San Francisco-based company expects annual adjusted profit per share between $4.92 and $4.94, compared with $4.71 to $4.73 forecast earlier.

Revenue for the quarter ended Oct. 31 was $7.84 billion, compared with analysts' average expectation of $7.82 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

A diverse portfolio that includes its Customer 360 platform and messaging app Slack has helped Salesforce attract customers at a time when digital transformation is becoming a priority, even as businesses brace for a broader economic downturn.

The business software maker expects current-quarter revenue to be between $7.93 billion and $8.03 billion.

On an adjusted basis, it earned $1.40 per share during the third quarter, compared with estimates of $1.21.

556,META,2022-06-01,"Trolling and safety fears plague many young women online, UK study finds","













LONDON, June 1 (Reuters) - Young women are more concerned about the mental health impact of being online than other internet users, with many citing personal safety fears and the harm caused by trolling, a study by Britain's media watchdog has found.

Regulators and activists across the world are increasingly calling on Big Tech companies to tackle hate speech on online platforms, a plea echoed by the head of Britain's Ofcom regulator as she unveiled the report on internet usage.

""The message from women who go online is loud and clear,"" Ofcom Chief Executive Melanie Dawes said in a statement on Wednesday.

""They are less confident about their personal online safety, and feel the negative effects of harmful content like trolling more deeply.""

The report found that women aged 18-34 were more likely than any other group to report a negative overall impact on mental health, with 23% of them disagreeing that being online has a positive effect on their mental health.

In comparison, 45% of men over the age of 18 agreed with that statement, while boys aged 13-17 were most likely to agree with it.

Dawes urged large tech companies to take women's online safety concerns seriously.

The research, which was conducted last year and surveyed more than 6,000 people, found that 60% of female users who had experienced trolling said they were bothered or offended by it, compared to just 25% of men.

The study also found that women feel less able to have a voice and share opinions online.

The sites and apps most visited by adults were owned by Alphabet (GOOGL.O), the owner of Google and YouTube. That was followed by Meta, which owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, and Amazon (AMZN.O).

557,META,2022-07-29,Brazil prosecutors ask WhatsApp to delay launch of new tool until January,"













BRASILIA, July 29 (Reuters) - Brazilian prosecutors on Friday called on messaging platform WhatsApp to delay the launch in Brazil of its new feature called Communities until January to avoid the spread of fake news during and immediately after the country's election in October.

The federal prosecutors said the expanded reach of the new tool comes ""at a time when fake news about the functioning of institutions and the integrity of the Brazilian voting system could jeopardize the democratic stability of the country.""

The MPF, as the federal prosecutors office is known, said Communities could undermine the efficient steps taken by WhatsApp in recent years to contain the spread of fake news.

WhatsApp is one of the messaging platforms that supporters of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro most use to communicate, organize rally and divulge their views. Bolsonaro is seeking re-election but is trailing leftist former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in Brazil's most polarized election in decades.

The messaging service owned by Meta Platforms agreed in April to postpone the launch of the new platform until after an expected second-round run-off vote at the end of October.

But the MPF said in a statement this was not enough to mitigate the ""serious risks that an increase in disinformation can generate ... in the last two months of the year.""

A WhatsApp spokesperson said the company will continue to carefully evaluate the best time to launch the new platform and would duly reply to the authorities' request.

The MPF said WhatsApp is installed on 99% of the smartphones in Brazil.

The new feature would expand the number of users from 256 at present to 512, allowing messages to be sent to 2,560 people at once. This would increase users' ability to viralize content, the MPF said.

The prosecutors noted WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption prevents those responsible for the platform from monitoring and moderating the content of the messages exchanged on it.

558,META,2022-11-30,U.S. urges rejection of undersea cable connection to Cuba,"













WASHINGTON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - A U.S. government committee on Thursday urged the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to deny an application to connect Cuba to the United States through a new undersea cable landing station to handle internet, voice and data traffic.

The Justice Department-led panel known as ""Team Telecom"" said the proposal raised national security concerns because the cable-landing system in Cuba would be owned and controlled by Cuba’s state-owned telecommunications monopoly, Empresa de Telecommunicaciones de Cuba S.A. (ETECSA) and would be the only direct, commercial undersea cable connection between the United States and Cuba.

The U.S. government in recent years has been scrutinizing undersea cable connections especially involving China. Around 300 subsea cables form the backbone of the internet, carrying 99% of the world’s data traffic.

Team Telecom said Cuba ""could access sensitive U.S. data traversing the new cable segment."" An FCC spokesman said the agency is reviewing the recommendations.

The existing ARCOS-1 submarine cable system connects the United States with 14 countries in the Caribbean, Central America and South America and sought to expand to a landing station in Cojimar, Cuba.

ARCOS-1 USA cited a 2019 State Department Cuba Internet Task Force that ""recommended enabling the construction of new submarine cables to Cuba.""

The company did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

ARCOS-1 USA said in a 2021 filing with the FCC that the cable would ""increase the means through which Cubans on the island can communicate with the United States and the rest of the world.""

Team Telecom said it supports the ""Cuban people’s access to an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable internet"" but said the proposal poses ""unacceptable risks to U.S. national security.""

Alphabet's Google and Facebook parent Meta previously abandoned a proposal to use an undersea cable to Hong Kong, which is controlled by Beijing after Team Telecom recommended blocking that plan in 2020.

In 2020, FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks called for enhanced scrutiny of undersea cables.

March 9 (Reuters) - Layoffs by U.S. companies over January and February touched the highest since 2009, with the tech sector accounting for more than a third of the over 180,000 job cuts announced, a report showed on Thursday.

In February alone, layoffs in the United States stood at 77,770, more than five times higher than the 15,245 job cuts announced a year earlier, according to the report from employment firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc.

The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose 21,000 in the week ended March 4, the Labor Department said - the biggest increase in five months.

""Right now, the overwhelming bulk of cuts are occurring in Technology. Retail and Financial are also cutting right now, as consumer spending matches economic conditions,"" said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc.

Tech companies from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) to PayPal Holdings (PYPL.O) have cut thousands of jobs this year in an effort to curb spending and protect margins amid an uncertain economic outlook.

""The layoffs that many of these companies are announcing are welcome to investors, sort of right-sizing the cost structure, rationalizing growth is being rewarded in the marketplace,"" said James Tierney, chief investment officer at asset management firm Alliance Bernstein.

Shares of Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) have gained between 6% and 54% so far this year, after falling between 29% and 64% in 2022.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday reaffirmed his message of higher and potentially faster interest rate hikes, which could force companies to slash more jobs.

U.S. firms announced plans to hire 28,830 workers in February, down 87% from 215,127 a year earlier, the report added.

BRUSSELS, May 18 (Reuters) - Japanese camera and printer maker Canon (7751.T) lost its challenge against a 28 million euros ($29.4 million) EU fine on Wednesday after Europe's second-top court upheld the sanction imposed for jumping the gun in a 2016 acquisition.

Companies which close a deal without first securing EU regulatory approval or provide misleading information during the regulatory review can face fines up to 10% of their aggregated turnover under EU merger rules.

The European Commission in its 2019 decision said Canon breached the rules by using a so-called ""warehousing"" two-step transaction structure involving an interim buyer to purchase Toshiba Corp's (6502.T) medical unit before gaining regulatory clearance.

The unorthodox method allowed Toshiba, which was struggling for cash after an accounting scandal, to book proceeds in time for the financial year-end ending in March.

The Luxembourg-based General Court backed the EU competition enforcer's finding.

""The (European) Commission was therefore right to observe that the Court's case-law distinguishes between the concepts of 'concentration' and 'implementation of a concentration',"" judges said.

In a recent gun-jumping case, the EU competition watchdog ordered U.S. life science company Illumina's (ILMN.O) to keep cancer detection test maker Grail Inc (GRAL.O) as a separate company after the former completed the deal while still waiting for the regulatory green light. The case is still pending.

The Commission has in recent years handed out stiff fines to Meta (FB.O), General Electric (GE.N) and German drugmaker Merck KGaA for giving misleading information during reviews of their deals.

The case is T-609/19 Canon V Commission.

DUBLIN, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) plans to invest more than 1.2 billion euros ($1.26 billion) to expand manufacturing at its plant in Dublin, it said on Thursday, handing the Irish multinational sector a jobs boost at a time when major tech firms are laying off staff.

The move will lead to the creation of 400 to 500 new roles and double the capacity to produce key substances used in biological drugs at a new facility, which is due for completion in 2027, Pfizer said.

The U.S. drugmaker is already one of the largest foreign-owned employers in Ireland and its biggest single investment to date in the country will bring its staffing there to 5,500.

Ireland is hugely reliant on the multinationals that together employ more than 275,000 people, or one in nine workers, and account for a large chunk of the country's income and corporate taxes.

Many of the world's leading drugmakers have operations in Ireland and Pfizer's expansion follows a similar announcement by U.S. healthcare company Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) in August that it would add 1,000 new jobs.

Multinational jobs growth soared to record levels in the first half of this year, but since then a number of tech companies including Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Twitter and Stripe have laid off Irish staff as part of global cutbacks.

The state agency charged with attracting new companies to the country has said it expects multinational investment to weaken slightly next year.

However data this week showed that Ireland's unemployment rate fell slightly to 4.4% in November and remains near a 21-year-low amid a tight labour market.

Pfizer, which last year began producing an ingredient for its COVID-19 vaccine at the facility in Dublin, said the new investment for non-COVID licensed and pipeline products will help to further expand the site's broad capabilities.

MILAN, Aug 1 (Reuters) - France, Italy and Spain are stepping up pressure on the European Commission to come up with legislation that ensures Big Tech firms partly finance telecoms infrastructure in the bloc, a document showed on Monday.

This was the first time the three governments have expressed their joint position on the issue.

EU regulators said in May they were analysing the question of whether tech giants Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google, Meta and Netflix (NFLX.O) should shoulder some of the costs of upgrading telecoms networks. read more

In a joint paper, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, the three governments said the six largest content providers accounted for 55% of internet traffic.

""This generates specific costs for European telecom operators in terms of capacity, at a time they are already hugely investing in the most costly parts of the networks with 5G and Fiber-To-The-Home,"" the document said.

It urged that European telecom networks and large online content providers pay fair shares of network costs.

""We call for a legislative proposal ... ensuring all market players contribute to digital infrastructure costs,"" the document said.

Two Italian government officials confirmed details of the joint document. One of them said Rome's government was set to give informal support in its caretaking capacity ahead of a general election in September.

The French and Spanish governments did immediately respond to a request for comment.

According to a study released by telecoms lobbying group ETNO earlier this year, an annual contribution of 20 billion euros to network costs by the tech giants could give a 72-billion-euro boost to the EU economy.

However, digital rights activists have warned making Big Tech pay for networks could threaten EU net neutrality rules, which they feared could be watered down in a deal with online giants to help fund telecoms network. read more

Any legislative proposal should ""ensure fairness between users in accordance with the net neutrality rules, which is a core principle we absolutely need to preserve,"" the joint document said.

REUTERS/Simon Dawson/File Photo















LONDON, March 30 (Reuters) - Shares in Martin Sorrell's S4 Capital (SFOR.L) plunged by 35% on Wednesday after auditors PwC said they were unable to complete the work needed for the digital advertising group to release its 2021 results on Thursday.

S4 said in a statement to the stock exchange that it had been informed at 1330 GMT by PwC that the auditors were ""unable to complete the work necessary"" and that the results would be published as soon as PwC completed its work.

""The company believes that the results for 2021 remain within the range of market expectations and continued to trade strongly in the first two months of 2022,"" it said.

Shares in S4, which had been trading generally flat on the day before the release of the statement at 1456 GMT, fell sharply and were down by 35% when the stock market closed at 1530.

S4 Capital was built by Sorrell, the world's most famous advertising executive, after he left global market leader WPP (WPP.L), which he had founded and run for more than 30 years.

It grew quickly as Sorrell acquired businesses to combine consumer data with digital content that enabled the company to work with the likes of Meta Platforms Inc's (FB.O) Facebook, Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, Burberry Group Plc (BRBY.L) and Netflix Inc (NFLX.O).

Having listed in late 2016, it reached a stock market peak in August 2021, giving it a share price of 878 pence and a market cap of 4.9 billion pounds ($6.5 billion) before it started to slide as the group invested more in staff and technology.

Sorrell told the Times newspaper in February that he was considering a New York listing because it would ""probably get a better valuation.""

564,META,2022-07-19,Paul Weiss bets on racial equality audits with new practice led by Loretta Lynch,"













(Reuters) - Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison has launched a new practice focused on racial equity and civil rights audits, touting the involvement of some of firm’s biggest legal names.

Former U.S. attorney general Loretta Lynch is leading the practice, which also includes former secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, star litigator Karen Dunn and Paul Weiss chairman Brad Karp, the firm said Tuesday.

Corporate America's demand for racial equality audits is growing, Johnson said in an interview. One catalyst was the 2020 murder of George Floyd and national protests over racial inequality. Shareholders, customers and employees have since called for greater accountability within companies related to diversity and inclusion, Johnson said.

JPMorgan Chase & Co, Meta Platforms Inc and Uber Technologies Inc are among U.S. companies that have already conducted or have committed to civil rights or racial equality audits. Amazon.com Inc said in April that Lynch would lead a racial equity audit of its hourly workers after facing pressure from shareholders.

“It’s a hallmark of good leadership that CEOs and boards of directors tackle these difficult issues, get ahead of them, and make the hard decisions to get to a better place,” Johnson said.

The cost and lawyer staffing required for racial equality audits varies based on the client, Johnson said. A 2020 assessment of equal justice within the New York State Court System that Johnson led took four months and involved one counsel, eight associates and two summer associates. But an in-depth investigation at a major corporation would likely take longer, he said.

Racial equity audits generally entail reviewing documents and conducting interviews to determine whether entities are meeting their diversity and inclusion commitments. They also include recommendations for improvements.

“The recommendations we provide must be practical and implementable — not something lofty that the client can’t really do much with,” Johnson said.

Joining Lynch, Johnson and Karp in the new practice are former deputy assistant attorney general Jeannie Rhee; litigators Elizabeth Sacksteder and Liza Velazquez; and David Curran, co-chair of the firm’s sustainability and ESG advisory practice.

565,META,2022-06-14,"Coinbase slashes 1,100 jobs as crypto winter sets in","













June 14 (Reuters) - Coinbase Global Inc (COIN.O) will cut about 1,100 jobs, or 18% of its workforce, the cryptocurrency exchange said on Tuesday, the latest company preparing to ride out a downturn in the cryptosphere.

The cryptocurrency market has been roiled by extreme volatility as investors dumped risky assets on fears that higher inflation readings would force the U.S. Federal Reserve to turn more aggressive in raising interest rates and tip the economy into a recession.

""We appear to be entering a recession after a 10+ year economic boom. A recession could lead to another crypto winter, and could last for an extended period,"" Chief Executive Officer Brian Armstrong said in a blogpost.

Bitcoin , the world's largest cryptocurrency, tumbled as much as 14% on Monday after crypto lender Celsius Network froze withdrawals and transfers. read more

Armstrong said employees would receive an email informing them if they had been affected, without giving further details.

Coinbase had earlier this month said it would extend a hiring freeze and rescind a number of accepted offers to deal with current macroeconomic conditions.

The company's shares fell about 5% in early trading, set to add to their roughly 80% tumble this year.

The crypto market meltdown has forced companies like BlockFi and Crypto.com to slash hundreds of jobs, while top firms including Meta Platforms (META.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O) have also tapped the brakes on hiring. read more

Coinbase had ramped up hiring when the crypto market scaled new highs during the pandemic, growing headcount by nearly four times in just five quarters.

""This level of headcount growth over five quarters was too ambitious, especially given that the company has lived through a crypto winter and knows how regularly volatile this market can be,"" KBW analyst Kyle Voigt said in a note to clients on Monday.

Coinbase expects to incur about $40 million to $45 million in total restructuring expenses, largely related to employee severance and other termination benefits.

JERUSALEM, June 15 (Reuters) - U.S. defence contractor L3Harris (LHX.N) is in talks to buy Israeli spyware firm NSO Group, U.S. and Israeli media reported, citing sources with knowledge of the deal.

The deal is yet to be finalised and needs to be approved by Israel, the U.S. and L3Harris’ board of directors, according to the joint report by Haaretz, The Washington Post and The Guardian, and confirms parts of a report published in Intelligence Online this week.

It noted that The White House is concerned that any deal with to buy the Israeli firm’s hacking tools would raise serious counterintelligence and security concerns.

NSO declined to comment on the reports.

The surveillance firm, which makes the Pegasus software, has been in the spotlight after revelations its tools had been used by governments and other agencies to spy on people’s cellphones. NSO has said its technology helps catch criminals.

NSO lost many of its existing customers when the U.S. Commerce Department in November banned the company.

The reports said that if approved, the deal could see NSO removed from the banned list – either directly, or by having its assets bought by L3Harris, which will only work with the United States and its allies.

In January, NSO had told Reuters it was in talks with a number of U.S. funds over ""various financial moves"", confirming media reports that it was discussing a sale of its assets.

Apple (AAPL.O) is among those to have sued NSO, saying it violated U.S. laws by breaking into the software installed on iPhones.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc , Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) have also criticised NSO or taken legal action.

567,META,2022-10-27,Morning Bid: The yen also rises,"













Oct 28 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever

The heat is off the Bank of Japan. A little.

The BOJ announces its policy decision on Friday against a much calmer market backdrop than only a few days ago. Economists expect no change to the bank's ultra-loose stance and an upward revision to the inflation outlook.

Other Japanese data due on Friday include inflation and unemployment, which could also drive trading sentiment in Asia.

The dollar has slumped to a three-week low against the yen and below the level that prompted the BOJ's historic yen-buying intervention on Sept. 22. Two subsequent bouts of suspected intervention appear to have done the trick, for now at least.

chart

chart

Not only has the BOJ been helped by a wider pullback in the dollar, as investors begin to consider a less aggressive Fed beyond next week's expected 75 bps rate hike, an easing of financial conditions has helped markets more broadly.

The Dow is up five days in a row, its best run since August, the 10-year Treasury yield is back below 4% and MSCI Asia ex-Japan is up three days in a row, its best stretch in seven weeks.

Of course, it's a bit more complicated than that. Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) shares sank 25% after its Q3 results spooked investors, hammering the tech sector. Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) are up next with earnings.

There are other reasons to suspect this week's 'risk on' rally could soon fade.

While it may not be directly affecting markets on a day-to-day basis, there is still a war raging on Europe's doorstep. And after Chinese President Xi Jinping secured his third term as leader at the weekend, cities and districts across China are doubling down on COVID-19 lockdowns.

Three key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Friday:

568,META,2023-01-20,Wall St Week Ahead Tech stock rebound faces doubters with earnings season ahead,"













NEW YORK, Jan 20 (Reuters) - A spate of earnings reports in coming weeks is set to test a recent bounce in technology and other megacap stocks, a category whose leadership position in U.S. markets has faltered after last year’s deep selloff.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index (.NDX) has gained nearly 6.2% in 2023, compared to a 3.45% rise for the S&P 500 (.SPX). Shares of some megacap companies - which include those grouped outside of tech in sectors like communication services and consumer discretionary - have shot higher, with Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta Platforms (META.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O) posting double-digit percentage increases.

Several factors are driving that outperformance, including investors piling into stocks they believe were overly punished in 2022. A moderation in bond yields, whose jump last year particularly pressured tech-stock valuations, is also likely helping the group, investors said.

Now, however, the focus is shifting to whether these companies can withstand a widely expected economic downturn while supporting valuations that some investors believe are too high.

""To keep this rebound going, the guidance for ’23 has to be less worse than what people are anticipating,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel, whose firm recently pared its holdings in Apple (AAPL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O).

Tech and growth stocks led U.S. equity markets for years following the 2008 financial crisis, aided by near-zero interest rates. They struggled along with broader markets last year as the Federal Reserve raised rates to fight surging inflation, and some investors doubt they will regain the market's pole position any time soon. The Nasdaq 100 fell 33% in 2022, while the S&P 500 lost 19.4%.

The top six stocks by market value in late 2021 - Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Amazon, Meta and Tesla (TSLA.O) - have seen their collective weight in the S&P 500 fall from 25% to 18%, according to Strategas Research Partners.

That dynamic echoes a pattern seen after the market’s dot-com bubble burst after the turn of the century. The six biggest stocks at that time saw their collective weight in the S&P 500 decline to 5% from a peak of 17% over a number of years, according to Strategas.

""This leadership unwind ... is going to be one that is measured in years, not in months or quarters,"" said Chris Verrone, head of technical and macro research at Strategas.

Megacap stocks as percentage of S&P 500

EARNINGS TEST

Companies comprising over half the S&P 500's market value are due to report results in the next two weeks, including Microsoft, the second-largest U.S. company by market value, on Tuesday, Elon Musk's Tesla and IBM (IBM.N) on Wednesday and Intel (INTC.O) on Thursday. Apple, the largest U.S. company by market value, and Google-parent Alphabet report the following week.

Fourth-quarter earnings in the tech sector are expected to have declined 9.1% from a year ago, compared to a 2.8% decline for S&P 500 earnings overall, according to Refinitiv IBES.

A critical question for many megacaps, once heralded for their stellar growth, is whether they can increase revenue and profits significantly while cutting costs in the face of a possible recession.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) said Friday it is cutting about 12,000 jobs, or 6% of its workforce, the latest tech giant to announce layoffs. Microsoft on Wednesday said it would eliminate 10,000 jobs while Amazon started notifying employees of its own 18,000-person job cuts.

""The biggest positive could be if they could show a control of expenses while keeping at least reasonable growth intact,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. ""It’s a hard balancing act.""

Reuters Graphics

Valuations for tech and megacap companies have moderated after last year's selloff, though they still stand above those of the broader market. The S&P 500 tech sector still trades at a roughly 19% premium to the broader index, above its 7% average of the past 10 years, according to Refinitiv Datastream.

Nonetheless, some investors are reluctant to bet against tech stocks.

The Wells Fargo Investment Institute counts tech as one of its favored U.S. sectors.

The firm expects an economic downturn and believes many tech companies have businesses that are resilient to economic uncertainty, said Sameer Samana, a senior global market strategist there.

""It’s just too important and too big a weighting not to participate,"" Samana said. ""But the years of handily outperforming the S&P are probably now behind us.”

569,META,2023-01-18,Apple indefinitely postpones launch of AR glasses - Bloomberg News,"













Jan 17 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has postponed the launch of its lightweight augmented-reality glasses indefinitely due to technical challenges, but is still planning to unveil its first mixed-reality headset this year, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.

The iPhone maker's mixed-reality headset - which combines both augmented and virtual reality - is set to launch in this year's spring event, Bloomberg said, adding that the device will cost around $3,000.

Apple's mixed-reality device would compete with the likes of Meta Platforms' (META.O) Quest Pro virtual and mixed-reality headset, which it launched late last year for $1,500, half of the Apple device's reported price.

The Cupertino, California-based company now plans to focus on lowering the price of the follow-up version of its mixed-reality device, expected as soon as 2024 or early 2025, instead of working on the AR glasses, according to the report.

Apple will aim to do so by using chips on par with those in the iPhone rather than components found in higher-end Mac computers.

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The Information website first reported Apple's plans to unveil a cheaper mixed-reality headset on Tuesday.

earlier in the day, the iPhone maker unveiled MacBooks powered by its new and faster M2 Pro and M2 Max chips in a surprise launch weeks ahead of its usual schedule.

April 18 (Reuters) - Gaming companies FlickPlay and The Sandbox announced a new partnership on Monday that will allow players to use a blockchain asset on both platforms, representing a key step in the building of the metaverse.

The idea of the metaverse involves people moving freely between virtual worlds on different platforms and taking their virtual clothing and other belongings with them, a concept called interoperability.

Such an idea is many years away and will require collaboration between companies and metaverse developers, including Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Epic Games. read more

FlickPlay is an app where players can unlock digital collectibles by using an interactive map of their actual surroundings, and then use their phone's camera to overlay the collectibles onto the real world and interact with the objects to make videos and other content. On Monday, the app announced its first collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) called Flicky, which will feature designs of an anthropomorphic chameleon wearing different clothes. read more

A portion of people who acquire a Flicky will be able to use the NFT as their avatar on The Sandbox, a web and mobile game where players can build a three-dimensional virtual world.

Initially, Flicky owners will unlock a version of the chameleon to use on The Sandbox, but soon they will be able to use the exact version of the digital asset that is stored on the blockchain in both games, said Pierina Merino, founder and chief executive of FlickPlay, adding that the company is working with The Sandbox to reach interoperability by the end of the year.

The integration is notable because it may be the first to bridge an NFT in the virtual world with usage linked to the physical world, said Sebastien Borget, co-founder of The Sandbox.

The partnership with FlickPlay will help ""create a more immersive experience that extends into the metaverse and The Sandbox,"" he said.

571,META,2022-07-18,"Russia fines Google $370 million for repeated content violations, regulator says","Summary

Summary Companies This content was produced in Russia, where the law restricts coverage of Russian military operations in Ukraine.















MOSCOW, July 18 (Reuters) - Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google was fined 21.1 billion roubles ($373 million) on Monday by a Moscow court for a repeated failure to remove content Russia deems illegal, such as ""fake news"" about the conflict in Ukraine, Russia's communications regulator said.

Moscow has long objected to foreign tech platforms' distribution of content that falls foul of its restrictions. But the simmering dispute has erupted into a full-on battle since Moscow assembled its armed forces before sending them into Ukraine in February.

Alphabet's YouTube has been a particular target of the state's ire but, unlike Twitter (TWTR.N) and Meta Platforms' (META.O) Facebook and Instagram, it has not been blocked.

The regulator, Roskomnadzor, said the Tagansky District Court had fined Google 21.1 billion roubles for repeatedly failing to restrict access promptly to banned materials, and singled out YouTube for particular criticism.

It said YouTube had not deleted ""fakes about the course of the special military operation in Ukraine, discrediting the armed forces of the Russian Federation"".

It also said YouTube was permitting content promoting extremist views and calls for children to participate in unauthorised protests.

Google, which can appeal, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The fine was calculated as a share of Google's annual turnover in Russia. It had been handed a similar 7.2 billion rouble penalty late last year.

Google's Russian unit's bank account has been seized, prompting the subsidiary to file for bankruptcy and making it impossible to pay staff and vendors. read more

Russia says it is conducting a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine to defuse a threat to its security and protect Russian speakers from persecution.

Ukraine and its Western allies dismiss such allegations as baseless pretexts for an illegal land grab.

Anton Gorelkin, deputy head of the parliamentary committee on information policy, said Google was showing a demonstrative disregard for Russian law.

""It is not hard to predict what this attitude will lead to: Google risks losing the Russian market altogether,"" he wrote on Telegram.($1 = 56.4650 roubles)

572,META,2022-03-22,Meta's plans to build Dutch data centre hit political glitch,"













AMSTERDAM, March 22 (Reuters) - The Dutch Senate on Tuesday passed a motion calling on the government to ""use its powers"" to temporarily block the construction of Facebook owner Meta's (FB.O) planned giant data centre in the Netherlands.

In December the town of Zeewolde, 50 km east of Amsterdam, approved plans to build the largest facility of its kind in the Netherlands, from which Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp would serve users across Europe.

The facility, which will use 1.38 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity and cover 166 hectares (410 acres) of farmland, is expected to run on green energy and create 400 permanent jobs.

It has been opposed by some environmental campaigners who do not want the limited supply of sustainable power currently being generated in the country to be used by a multinational.

A majority of parties in the Senate on Tuesday supported a proposal in which the government led by Prime Minister Mark Rutte was asked to halt the project until a national policy on data centres has been developed.

The motion asked the government to delay construction until it can be determined whether the data centre meets environmental regulations and the as yet undetermined national policy on the facilities.

Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Rutte's own Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and another ruling coalition party, the Christian Democrats, voted against the motion.

""This is a purely political decision,"" Dutch Data Center Association managing director Stijn Grove said in a reaction sent to Reuters, adding that it had been made ""largely because it is Facebook"", which is facing a negative backlash against Big Tech as a whole.

Not only are larger data centres more efficient and environmentally friendly, he said, they are needed to improve Europe's digital infrastructure, which lags behind North American and Asia.

Grove said the Netherlands can't have the ambition to be a digital leader without supporting the required infrastructure.

Roughly 60 data centre operators in the Netherlands account for around 2.8% of national electricity consumption, the association said.

Jan 17 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) plans to cut thousands of jobs with some roles expected to be eliminated in human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.

The expected layoffs would be the latest in the U.S. technology sector, where companies including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) have announced retrenchment exercises in response to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook.

Microsoft's move could indicate that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs.

""From a big picture perspective, another pending round of layoffs at Microsoft suggests the environment is not improving, and likely continues to worsen,"" Morningstar analyst Dan Romanoff said.

U.K broadcaster Sky News reported, citing sources, that Microsoft plans to cut about 5% of its workforce, or about 11,000 roles.

The company plans to cut jobs in a number of engineering divisions on Wednesday, Bloomberg News reported, according to a person familiar with the matter, while Insider reported that Microsoft could cut recruiting staff by as much as one-third.

The cuts will be significantly larger than other rounds in the past year, the Bloomberg report said.

Microsoft declined to comment on the reports.

The company had 221,000 full-time employees, including 122,000 in the United States and 99,000 internationally, as of June 30, according to filings.

Microsoft is under pressure to maintain growth rates at its cloud unit Azure, after several quarters of downturn in the personal computer market hurt Windows and devices sales.

It had said in July last year that a small number of roles had been eliminated. In October, news site Axios reported that Microsoft had laid off under 1,000 employees across several divisions.

Shares of Microsoft, which is set to report quarterly results on Jan. 24, were marginally higher in late afternoon trading.

574,META,2022-10-11,Roblox says policing virtual world is like 'shutting down speakeasies',"













Oct 11 (Reuters) - As online gaming platform Roblox Corp (RBLX.N) confronts a lawsuit alleging it enabled a California girl's exploitation, its chief scientist said finding dangerous content in the company's virtual world is nothing like spotting it in video.

""It's such a challenge to moderate 3D,"" said Morgan McGuire in an interview at the Reuters Momentum conference in Austin on Tuesday. He had no comment on the recent lawsuit but said Roblox was built with safety and civility at the forefront.

San Mateo, Calif.-based Roblox is deploying bots to patrol user-generated games and press buttons to detect any dangerous content that players have disguised.

""This is more like shutting down speakeasies,"" he said, referring to U.S. prohibition-era bars hiding from law enforcement.

BBC reported this year that users had created explicit private spaces, known as ""condos,"" where people's digital avatars could engage in virtual sex.

McGuire said the company is able to remove inappropriate content within minutes thanks to artificial intelligence software and moderators. What escapes scrutiny is not ""horrifically bad"" but more likely a terms violation, he said.

Still, a lawsuit filed last week alleges that adult men on Roblox connected with a girl, who was born in 2009, and nudged her to sign up for Discord, Snap Inc's (SNAP.N) Snapchat and Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) Instagram to talk to them. The suit alleges they pushed her to drink, abuse prescription drugs and send explicit images, later precipitating suicide attempts.

McGuire said Roblox bars users from posting phone numbers or off-platform links. But as momentum grows to connect disparate worlds into an alternate digital reality called the metaverse, Roblox is engaging with a consortium of companies about how they could work together in the face of different standards, he said.

575,META,2022-11-28,Twitter answering privacy concerns 'so far' - lead EU regulator,"[1/2] Figurines with smartphones and computers are seen in front of the Twitter logo in this illustration, November 28, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration















DUBLIN, Nov 28 (Reuters) - The lead privacy regulator for Twitter in the European Union said it was concerned about the potential impact of layoffs at the social media company on its ability to meet privacy obligations, but said it was so far getting answers to its questions.

Twitter has fired top executives and enforced steep job cuts with little warning following billionaire Elon Musk's tumultuous takeover of the company last month. About half of the workforce - around 3,700 employees - has been laid off, while more than 1,000 have resigned.

Prior to the cuts, Twitter employed around 500 people at its European headquarters in Dublin where - like many other tech giants - Ireland's Data Privacy Commissioner (DPC) is the social media platform's lead privacy regulator within the EU.

""We are concerned and we're tracking it very closely. So far we're getting answers to our questions,"" DPC head Helen Dixon told Irish national broadcaster RTE on Monday.

The comments follow similar concerns raised last week by the EU's justice chief around Twitter's ability to comply with tough new rules over illegal online content following a visit to the company's Dublin headquarters.

Dixon said the DPC was in contact with Twitter several times a day to establish what roles remain in place and had ""a range of contacts"" still based at Twitter in Dublin.

""It's a fast-evolving situation, I think where we arrive at the point where we can't get answers and we have no point of contact, then we will be in very serious difficulty,"" Dixon said.

At a basic level, an organisation like Twitter must have a data protection officer in place with a team around them, as well as a board based in Dublin that is making decisions on personal data processing in respect of EU users, she added.

The watchdog said it had also been able to continue with six investigations into Twitter relating to potential privacy breaches that pre-date Musk's acquisition.

The DPC, which regulates Apple, Google, Meta and other technology giants due to the location of their EU headquarters in Ireland, has 40 inquiries open into big tech firms.

576,META,2022-08-09,Twitter says loading issues fixed after user complaints,"













Aug 9 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) said on Tuesday it had fixed issues after thousands of users reported that they were having trouble accessing the micro-blogging platform.

More than 27,000 users had reported outage of the service, according to Downdetector.com, a website which tracks outages by collating status reports from a number of sources including user-submitted errors on its platform.

The outage started at 1.50 p.m. ET and had as many as 35,000 reports at its peak.

""We fixed it! We made an internal systems change that didn't go as planned and have rolled it back. Twitter should now be loading as expected. Sorry about that!,"" Twitter said in a tweet.

This was the second outage in as may months.

The social media company is in a legal tussle with Tesla (TSLA.O) boss Elon Musk over his $44 billion takeover deal.

Last month, Twitter users faced a nearly three-hour outage in July, with the San Francisco-based company saying it had some trouble with its internal systems that impacted many globally.

Notorious for outages in its early years, Twitter was known for using its popular ""Fail Whale"" illustration, which showed a beluga whale being lifted by birds, during such incidents.

Twitter users took to Reddit to complain about the outage, with many users saying all they could see was the Twitter logo when they tried to log in.

""There is no Twitter to find out why Twitter isn't working"" one user joked on a Reddit channel dedicated to Twitter.

Twitter had suffered another widespread outage in February that it blamed on a software glitch.

Other big technology companies have also been hit by outages in the past year, with a near six-hour disruption at Meta Platforms (META.O) keeping WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger out of reach for billions of users in October.

BERLIN, May 4 (Reuters) - EU antitrust rules should be beefed up to allow regulators to break up companies for serious breaches, German State Secretary Sven Giegold said on Wednesday, urging EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager to consider this when reforming regulations.

Rules known as Regulation 1/2003, in force since 2004, have allowed Vestager to go after Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta (FB.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Intel (INTC.O), and impose billions of euros in fines.

Vestager's proposal to reform the rules came as companies complained about lengthy proceedings and demands for information ranging from minutiae to complex data. read more

Giegold, state secretary at the German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, said Vestager should be bolder.

""Market investigations and structural remedies should also be on the table for the upcoming review of the regulation 1/2003 that Vice President Margaret Vestager has announced recently,"" he told a conference organised by the German cartel office.

Giegold said European Union merger rules could also do with an update to strengthen them, in particular against big companies acquiring smaller rivals to close them down.

""One particular area where we need reinforcement is EU merger control. The number of interventions in mergers has dropped over the years,"" he said.

""Unfortunately, and to some extent incomprehensibly the European mission so far has resisted calls to look into the EU merger regulation and the underlying substantive guidelines to better deal with killer acquisitions. We need reform here,"" Giegold said.

Giegold said the German government planned to give more powers to the country's cartel office.

""We will look into giving more flexibility to the Bundeskartellamt in this regard in regard with its market internal investigations when reforming our national competition law,"" he said.

Summary

Summary Companies Tough new media law in force, backed by AKP and allies

Platforms required to remove content, share data

Firms face ad bans, bandwidth throttling

Fears of setting precedent for other jurisdictions















ISTANBUL, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Social media companies are unlikely to fully abide by Turkey's new law requiring them to remove ""disinformation"" content and share user data with authorities, analysts say, raising the spectre of possible platform disruptions before elections next year.

Facebook, Twitter, Google and others are required to fully comply with the law by next April or face possible advertising bans and eventually cuts to their bandwidth, posing a dilemma for the companies before elections set for June.

Analysts and consultants said the companies have global privacy standards they are unlikely to breach in Turkey as that could set dangerous precedents for other countries looking to exert control on social platforms.

""Some of these companies are not likely to comply with the law,"" said Sinan Ulgen, founding partner at Istanbul Economics, which consults on regulatory and legal affairs.

This is ""because of both the onerous requirements and what that would mean for their norms of data privacy and confidentiality, and also of setting a precedent that can be used in other jurisdictions,"" he said.

Under the law, which took effect this week, companies must share with authorities users' information if they post content constituting crimes, including misleading information.

Social media companies are required to appoint Turkish representatives. They face bandwidth being throttled by up to 90% immediately after a court order should the representative fail to provide information to authorities.

Critics of the law say it could tighten the government's grip on social media, one of the last bastions of free speech and dissent in Turkey after 20 years of rule by President Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling AK Party (AKP).

The AKP and nationalist allies backed the law. The opposition dubbed it ""the censorship law"" and says it could influence June parliamentary and presidential elections, which polls show Erdogan could lose.

The law has mainly been criticised for imposing jailtime on social media users and journalists spreading ""disinformation"", but it also builds on legislation imposed on social media companies in 2020, with much tougher measures.

For example, companies will be held ""directly responsible"" for ""unlawful"" content and tags if they do not remove it within four hours after authorities' request.

WASTED EFFORTS

Social media is already strictly monitored, with people frequently tried over posts such as those criticising Turkey's incursions in Syria or seen as insulting the president.

A Reuters investigation recently showed how pressure from authorities and self-censorship has transformed mainstream Turkish media into a tight chain of command of government-approved headlines.

Social media companies have so far been able to comply with the 2020 law by setting up small corporate entities in Turkey that they could easily pull out if pressured, said Yaman Akdeniz, cyber rights expert and professor at Istanbul Bilgi University.

Those laws were a ""soft transition"" but now the government has made them much more serious with the new bill, he added.

""If you accept all of these, you become a part of the law enforcement because the expectation is that you assist in everything,"" he said.

Companies may be fined up to 3% of their global revenue if they do not abide by the law, as well as advertising bans.

Akdeniz said authorities probably wouldn't impose penalties such as throttling immediately but begin with smaller steps such as fines. However, he said the possibility of tougher measures poses a constant threat to companies.

Twitter (TWTR.N) declined to comment on its approach to the law. Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (META.O), Google's Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Tiktok did not respond to requests for comment.

Sezen Yesil, Meta's public policy director for Turkey and Azerbaijan, told a parliamentary commission in June there were uncertainties about how the laws will be implemented.

Pelin Kuzey Karaman, Google's director of government relations and public policies in Turkey, told the commission it had made ""the maximum effort"" to abide by the 2020 law.

""Unfortunately, these efforts we have made at the maximum level only 1-1/2 to 2 years ago will almost be wasted... with the draft bill. As Google, we truly see this as a saddening development,"" she said, according to the record of the meeting.

Under the new law, over-the-network service providers such as Meta-owned messaging application WhatsApp, which is ubiquitous in Turkey, are also required to establish a local company. The law places them under the Information and Communication Technologies Authority (ICTA), which can block them if they operate without authorisation.

""I think (the law) is like a wish list - they put whatever they can think of in there,"" Akdeniz said. ""There is an attempt to regulate social media platforms that could be a model law for authoritarian regimes.""

579,META,2022-10-17,U.S. security officials worry about homegrown election threats,"













SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Domestic disinformation campaigns and homegrown threats to poll workers are emerging as bigger concerns ahead of the Nov. 8 U.S. congressional elections than foreign interference, according to U.S. cybersecurity and law enforcement officials.

Russia and Iran, accused of meddling in past U.S. elections using disinformation campaigns, are enmeshed in their own crises - the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Iranian mass protests - and have not yet been found to have targeted this election, said two senior U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.

According to information disclosed as part of criminal cases, Russian and Iranian intelligence units deployed hackers and fake social media accounts in recent U.S. elections to try to influence the vote and sow discord.

Election integrity has been a contentious issue in the United States, particularly in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election. Republican former President Donald Trump continues to make false claims that the election was stolen from him by Democrat Joe Biden through widespread voting fraud.

""At this time, we are not aware of any specific or credible threats to compromise or disrupt election infrastructure,"" top U.S. cybersecurity official Jen Easterly told reporters last week during a video conference on election security.

""That said, the current election threat environment is more complex than it has ever been,"" added Easterly, who heads the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).

Republicans are aiming to win back control of the Senate and House of Representatives from Biden's fellow Democrats in the midterm elections, a development that would imperil major parts of his legislative agenda.

Since 2020, there have been numerous reported incidents of poll workers being threatened, harassed or assaulted by Trump supporters, as detailed by Reuters. Opinion polls have shown that a large majority of Republican voters believe Trump won that election.

""There is a lot of rhetoric about violence against poll workers,"" said one of the U.S. officials, who is involved in efforts to prevent the spread of election-related disinformation. ""So we have made it a point ... to aggressively investigate all of those threats.""

The official noted that the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment safeguard for free speech would protect certain types of comments.

""First Amendment-protected is, 'Oh, I wish so-and-so can die.' However, if you say, 'I'm going to come to his house and kill so-and-so,' then we can open an investigation. Even though it's a small minority of people who are putting out all of this type of language, it gets amplified on social media. So I would say that is kind of my biggest concern,"" the official added.

The Election Integrity Partnership, a non-partisan group that has helped the CISA combat election disinformation, said the vast majority of disinformation and false rumors about the 2020 election spread primarily through far-right influencers catering to Trump voters.

'TROUBLING CHANGES'

""One of the most troubling changes since 2020 is how widespread disinformation about the election has become,"" said Edward Perez, an expert in election infrastructure policy and technology at the California-based election research group OSET, who has also worked at Twitter Inc (TWTR.N).

""Past efforts by foreign actors to sow division in the U.S. appear to be bearing fruit because now much of the work of spreading falsehoods that undermine public confidence in elections is being carried out by domestic actors,"" Perez added.

U.S. officials have found that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election with a campaign of hacking and propaganda intended to sow strife in the United States, harm Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and boost Trump's chances, with a number of Russian individuals and companies facing criminal charges.

In July of this year, U.S. prosecutors charged a Russian man with orchestrating a multi-year effort to use political groups in Florida, Georgia and California to cause discord, spread Russian propaganda or interfere in American elections.

The two U.S. officials who described to Reuters the current election-related threats said they were not aware of any ongoing foreign information operations aimed at misleading Americans about the voting process.

U.S. government agencies, including the CISA and the FBI, have been collaborating with social media companies including Twitter and Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), the Facebook and Instagram parent company, to clamp down on election-related disinformation arising from domestic sources.

A Twitter spokesperson, who asked not to be named, said the company has taken steps to prevent foreign interference and domestic ""information operations,"" or disinformation campaigns.

""The growing threats posed by malicious actors need to be addressed holistically,"" the spokesperson added, ""which is why we regularly engage outside experts, as well as law enforcement, to improve our understanding of the actors involved and to develop a collaborative strategy.""

Meta spokesperson Corey Chambliss declined to comment on the company's election security efforts.

580,META,2023-01-06,Chip woes short-circuit Samsung's best laid plans,"













HONG KONG, Jan 6 (Reuters Breakingviews) - South Korea's Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) can only defy gravity for so long. The world's top memory-chip maker on Friday said it estimates quarterly operating profit will fall a whopping 69% year-on-year in the three months to December to an eight-year low of $3.4 billion as demand for semiconductors plunge. The worse-than-expected earnings guidance throws cold water on the chipmaker's aggressive supply and capital expenditure spending plans laid out in October.

Even as rivals like SK Hynix (000660.KS) said it would more than halve 2023 capex, Samsung at the time insisted it won't ""artificially"" cut production - a sign that the $308 billion behemoth was moving to shore up its market dominance. That now looks less likely: a severe supply glut is on track to drag down average selling prices of DRAM and NAND memory chips by 47% and 53% respectively this year, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. Notably, the bank reckons Samsung will record its first-ever annual loss in the latter business.

Analysts at Citi reckon Samsung’s memory chip capex this year will be roughly $25 billion, more than 10% lower than their earlier forecast. Less output should pave the way for a market recovery in the second half. Samsung's best laid plans are starting to go astray. (By Robyn Mak)

581,META,2022-11-15,Asset manager Ninety One warns market challenges not over yet,"













Nov 15 (Reuters) - Ninety One Plc (N91.L) warned of challenging market conditions for a ""foreseeable future"", sending shares in the London-listed asset manager down 6% on Tuesday, after it posted net outflows of 3.2 billion pounds ($3.8 billion) in the first half.

After a boost in managed assets during the pandemic, fund managers are now witnessing a fall as jitters over the UK's financial stability and a sharp sell-off in global markets compound worries about a recession amid soaring rising inflation and interest rates, as well as heightened geopolitical tensions.

""This period presented us and the industry with an unusually challenging environment,"" Chief Executive Officer Hendrik du Toit said on a media call.

The Anglo-South African company's assets under management (AUM) at end of the six months to Sept. 30 stood at 132.3 billion pounds, compared with 143.9 billion pounds at end-March, when it also reported net inflows of 5 billion pounds.

""There are a few accidents that should still happen before the markets settle down,"" Toit said, referring to events such as the crisis in Chinese property markets, mass layoffs at Facebook parent Meta (META.O) and volatility in the cryptoverse.

""I don't think we're out of the woods yet... At Ninety One we are preparing for a prolonged period of volatility and challenging markets, and we are just warning shareholders that we don't think there will be easy gains to be had,"" he added.

Several British fund managers, including Man Group (EMG.L), Quilter (QLT.L), Rathbones (RAT.L), and Liontrust Asset Management (LIO.L), have said their AUM dropped in the three months to end-September.

Ninety One's profit before tax in the period fell 16% from last year to 110.6 million pounds, but Toit sought to reassure investors that the business was in ""good shape"" and the company would focus on long-term growth.

582,META,2023-02-24,"Ericsson to lay off 8,500 employees -memo","













STOCKHOLM, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Telecom equipment maker Ericsson (ERICb.ST) will lay off 8,500 employees globally as part of its plan to cut costs, a memo sent to employees and seen by Reuters said.

While technology companies such as Microsoft (MSFT.O), Meta (META.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) have laid off thousands of employees citing economic conditions, Ericsson's move would be the largest layoff to hit the telecoms industry.

""The way headcount reductions will be managed will differ depending on local country practice,"" Chief Executive Borje Ekholm wrote in the memo.

""In several countries the headcount reductions have already been communicated this week,"" he said.

On Monday, the company, which employs more than 105,000 worldwide, announced plans to cut about 1,400 jobs in Sweden.

While Ericsson did not disclose which geography would be most affected, analysts had predicted that North America would likely be most affected and growing markets such as India the least.

The company said in December it would cut costs by 9 billion crowns ($880 million) by the end of 2023 as demand slows in some markets, including North America.

""It is our obligation to take this cost out to remain competitive,"" Ekholm said in the memo. ""Our biggest enemy right now may be complacency.""

Many telecom companies had beefed up their inventories during the height of the pandemic which is now leading to slowing orders for telecom equipment makers.

Verizon (VZ.N), one of the largest telecom companies, plans to spend between $18.25 billion and $19.25 billion this year, down from a capital expenditure budget of $23 billion last year.

Ericsson Chief Financial Officer Carl Mellander had earlier told Reuters that cost cuts would involve reducing consultants, real estate and employee headcount.

Nordic rival Nokia (NOKIA.HE) has not announced any plans to lay off employees.

583,META,2023-02-14,Exclusive: EU's Breton plans consultation on Big Tech and telecoms network costs,"













STRASBOURG, Feb 14 (Reuters) - EU industry chief Thierry Breton is poised to launch a consultation on whether Big Tech should bear some telecoms network costs, he said on Tuesday ahead of a telecoms conference taking place in Barcelona from Feb. 27 to March 2.

EU telecoms providers including Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), Orange (ORAN.PA), Telefonica (TEF.MC) and Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) have for years sought to have Big Tech foot some infrastructure cost for 5G and broadband.

The telecoms companies say the six largest content providers - Meta (META.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O) - account for more than half of data internet traffic.

The tech giants say the idea amounts to an internet traffic tax that could undermine Europe's net neutrality rules to ensure all users are treated equally.

Asked when the consultation would be launched, Breton told Reuters: ""Wait for my speech at Barcelona. Yes, I will announce it soon. At Barcelona.""

The consultation is likely to take about 12 weeks before the European Commission will propose legislation that will need to be thrashed out by EU countries and EU lawmakers before it can become law.

Breton said he was confident the process could be wrapped up by the end of the year. ""We will have time, yes,"" he said.

Announcing the start of the consultation at Barcelona is a strong signal to the telecoms sector of Breton's backing, a telecoms industry source said. It would be Breton's first appearance at an event traditionally attended by all major telecoms operators.

584,META,2023-02-06,EU's Breton urges rethink on cross-border telecoms mergers,"













BRUSSELS, Feb 6 (Reuters) - EU industry chief Thierry Breton urged antitrust regulators on Monday to consider allowing more cross-border mergers in the European telecoms industry, backing calls by Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), Orange (ORAN.PA), Telefonica (TEF.MC) and Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI).

EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager has been reluctant to allow telecoms providers acquire EU peers without hefty remedies, especially when deals reduce the number of players from four to three, underlining concerns about the market power of fewer but larger telecoms operators.

The telecoms industry however said consolidation is required to pool resources to roll out costly fast-speed broadband and 5G.

""I believe that creating a true single market for telecommunications services also requires a reflection on encouraging cross-border consolidation, all while preserving fair and necessary competition for the benefit of our consumers,"" Breton said in a speech to be delivered at an event in Helsinki.

On the issue of whether Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O), Meta (META.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) should bear some network costs, Breton said the European Commission will launch a consultation this month on the topic.

""The investments which will be required to achieve our ambitions will be enormous and we need to ensure that they are matched by the availability of sufficient funding. The burden of this financing should not be only on the shoulders of the member states or the EU budget,"" he said.

""At a time when technology companies are using most bandwidth and telco operators are seeing their return on investment drop, this also raises the question of who pays for the next generation of connectivity infrastructure,"" Breton said.

585,META,2022-11-10,Amazon reviewing unprofitable business units to cut costs - WSJ,"













Nov 10 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) is undertaking a review of its unprofitable businesses, including the devices unit that houses voice assistant Alexa, to cut costs, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, sending its shares up 11%.

Following a months-long review, Amazon has told employees in some unprofitable units to look for jobs elsewhere in the company, while moving to redeploy staff from certain teams to more profitable areas and closing teams in areas such as robotics and retail, the WSJ reported.

Amazon is closely evaluating its Alexa business and is currently considering whether it should focus on trying to add new capabilities to the voice assistant, which is available on a variety of Amazon devices, the report added.

Adding capabilities would require greater investment, and many customers use the device for only a few functions, according to the report.

The unit that houses Alexa has posted an operating loss of more than $5 billion a year, the WSJ reported, citing documents.

""We're of course taking into account the current macro-environment and considering opportunities to optimize costs,"" Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser said.

Glasser said the company was ""optimistic about Alexa's future"" as it remains an important business and area of investment for Amazon.

The news comes just weeks after Amazon warned of a slowdown in growth for the busy holiday season when it generates the highest sales, saying inflation-wary consumers and businesses had less money to spend.

Last week, Amazon said it would freeze hiring to corporate workforce for the next few months due to an ""unusual macro-economic environment"". read more

""Experimentation and running with too many things that don't generate a return is no longer a luxury Amazon can afford,"" GlobalData analyst Neil Saunders said.

Amazon's cost-cut plan mirrors moves by technology giant Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), which on Wednesday said it would cut 13% of its workforce, while other tech giants including Alphabet (GOOGL.O) have also paused hiring.

Summary Companies

Companies Law firms Allen & Overy partners with legal startup Harvey

Harvey received $5 million in a funding round led by the OpenAI Startup Fund last year















(Reuters) - Harvey AI, an artificial intelligence startup backed by an OpenAI-managed investment fund, has partnered with one of the world's largest law firms to automate some legal document drafting and research in what the company says could be the first of more such deals.

London-founded law firm Allen & Overy said Wednesday that more than 3,500 of its lawyers have already tested Harvey, which is adapted from OpenAI's GPT software.

Harvey received a $5 million investment last year in a funding round led by the OpenAI Startup Fund. OpenAI's ChatGPT service has sparked frenzied interest in technology called generative AI that uses a range of inputs to create new content.

Several legal technology companies in recent months have rolled out new tools that incorporate generative AI, including for drafting and reviewing contracts.

""I think over time it will be a serious competitive disadvantage"" for law firms that do not adopt generative AI, said David Wakeling, an Allen & Overy partner who heads its markets innovation group.

""We're seeing it as a way of saving our people a couple hours a week-plus"" on the time it takes to perform client work, he said about the firm's deal with Harvey. He said the technology serves as a starting point and a human lawyer will always check any AI-assisted work.

Allen & Overy and Harvey, which was founded last year, declined to disclose financial terms of the deal.

Harvey is designed to create tailored generative AI-driven products for different law firms and specific client matters, according to its founders, Gabriel Pereyra and Winston Weinberg.

Allen & Overy is the first law firm to partner with Harvey, but the company is starting to work with other big law firms to develop custom tools, said Pereyra, a former research scientist at companies including Meta Platforms Inc and Alphabet Inc-owned DeepMind Technologies Ltd. He declined to disclose the firms.

Weinberg, who was previously an associate at U.S. law firm O'Melveny & Myers, said the repetition and text-based learning involved in legal work makes it a good match for technology like Harvey's.

NOTE: This story was updated to clarify that funding for Harvey AI came from the OpenAI Startup Fund.

Aug 9 (Reuters) - Hong Kong-based fintech firms AMTD Digital , Magic Empire Global (MEGL.O) and Top Financial Group (TOP.O) tumbled on Tuesday after a meteoric rally this month that was reminiscent of last year's meme-stock frenzy.

The obscure companies have recorded eye-watering gains just days after their U.S. market debuts, with AMTD Digital climbing to as high as $2,555.30 last week from its debut price of $7.80 in July. At its peak, the company's market valuation dwarfed that of Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (META.O). read more

On Tuesday, AMTD Digital was down 45% at $221. Online brokerage Top Financial was trading 14% lower at $17.70, a day after its shares doubled in value to $20.75.

Magic Empire Global, which provides financial advisory and underwriting services, plunged 81.4% to $21.53. Its shares had risen as much as 6,000% from the $4 IPO price in just the second session of trading on Monday.

While the dramatic gains drew parallels to the frenzy in shares of GameStop (GME.N) and AMC Entertainment (AMC.N) in 2021, trading volumes in the Hong Kong stocks have been at a fraction of the U.S. companies.

""I haven't seen a fundamental development you could point to and say this is why it (the rally) is happening,"" said Rick Meckler, partner, Cherry Lane Investments.

""Maybe the names are changing, but there's still a lot of interest among these investors seeking out a place to gamble. Eventually, it ends in tears for them.""

AMTD Digital has said it was monitoring the share volatility. On Monday, the underwriters of its IPO exercised an option to buy 2.4 million additional shares at the IPO price, taking advantage of the rally.

""It seems strange and I'm surprised the stock exchanges or regulators are not getting more involved because it doesn't sound like an efficient market,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.

The Hong Kong-based companies did not respond to requests for comment outside business hours.

588,META,2022-06-14,Adobe revamps metaverse design tools for Apple's chips,"













June 14 (Reuters) - Adobe Inc (ADBE.O) on Tuesday said it has reworked several of its tools for creating three-dimensional content to make them work well on Apple Inc (AAPL.O) computers that use the iPhone maker's proprietary ""M"" series chips.

Adobe has long been a major player providing software in creative fields like photography, graphic design and film. But Adobe has been working to build out more tools for making the three-dimensional worlds and objects used in video games and, increasingly, the so-called metaverse, where companies like Meta Platforms Inc are hoping to use augmented reality technology to overlay digital content on the real world.

Adobe acquired software tools called Substance 3D in 2019 when it bought French firm Allegorithmic for an undisclosed sum. The tool helps the makers of movies like ""Frozen 2"" and games imbue the digital objects they create with a wide array of lifelike textures, like wood or leather.

Adobe said that it has reworked the software so that it will run on Apple's proprietary chips, a move that is likely to help Apple gain some ground of its own. While Apple's laptops and desktop are widely used in some creative fields like music production, game developers tend to still rely on PCs that can be paired with power graphics chips from Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) that help graphics look more realistic.

But Apple's new chips have added new graphics processing power, and Adobe plans to take full advantage of it in the new software, said Francois Cottin, senior director of marketing at Adobe.

""For these kinds of use cases, vertical integration is really key, from the app all the way to the chip,"" Cottin said. ""We've been working very closely with Apple on future-looking use cases. I think Substance 3D definitely represent that.""

Adobe also said Tuesday that it had signed up new customers for its three-dimensional content creation tools, including German fashion brand Hugo Boss and outdoor footwear brand Salomon Group.

589,META,2023-02-02,Amazon workers in Barcelona strike over warehouse closure,"













MADRID, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Workers at an Amazon (AMZN.O) logistics centre on the outskirts of Barcelona protested on Thursday on the second day of an indefinite strike sparked by the company's plans to shut down the warehouse and relocate employees to other provinces.

They have staged pickets at the entrances to the warehouse, but union leaders said they were allowing truck drivers to enter and leave the centre where 800 people work and accused Amazon of acting ""in bad faith"" by calling riot police to clear the area on the first day.

Amazon declined to comment on the ongoing dispute.

On Jan. 11, the delivery giant announced it would close the warehouse in the Martorelles suburb and shift its activity to the city of Zaragoza, some 300 km (186 miles) west of Barcelona.

While Amazon said all employees would be transferred to other logistics centres in Spain without any job losses, trade unions described the move as ""disguised layoffs"" and said the collective bargaining deals in other provinces would result in worse pay conditions for workers.

""Does Amazon really need to make more profit? It has more millions than entire countries,"" Elisenda Mas, a spokesperson for Spain's largest union CCOO, told Reuters. ""It's shameful.""

She said that Amazon's latest offer for employees willing to move to Zaragoza or to Figueres in the neighbouring province of Girona - located 125 km north of Barcelona - was a one-off relocation bonus of 3,000 euros ($3,280) plus an unspecified amount spread out in 12 monthly instalments.

But the separate collective bargaining agreement in those provinces would entail a pay cut of at least 700 euros per month, she said, adding that moving away from Barcelona, where her husband works and her child attends school, was not a viable option.

Striking workers are asking to be relocated to other Amazon warehouses within the province of Barcelona.

Last month, Amazon announced more than 18,000 job cuts globally, mainly impacting its e-commerce and human resources divisions, amid similar moves by tech companies such as Meta (META.O) or Alphabet (GOOGL.O).

590,META,2022-11-03,Hivemapper starts issuing crypto tokens for vehicle dashcam footage,"













Nov 3 (Reuters) - Drivers around the world from Thursday can generate cryptocurrency by installing a dashcam and sharing images with a San Francisco startup that aims to nab some buyers of street-level imagery away from Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google.

Hivemapper Inc, which announced $18 million in fundraising from investors in April, said it has so far sold over 5,500 dashcams across 66 countries. As drivers record road signs and storefronts, they mint tokens that Hivemapper named Honey.

Hivemapper Chief Executive Ariel Seidman said U.S. regulations limit him from discussing how and when Honey can be spent.

""I wish I could tell you,"" he said. ""There's real value that's being created, and it will be reflected in the token.""

The venture mirrors projects such as wireless data provider Helium that seek to encourage mass participation by leveraging blockchains or other Web3 technologies, as proponents call them. While some investors such as Hivemapper backer Multicoin Capital are bullish on Web3 efforts, skeptics worry about currency speculation and fraud.

With its network of cameras, Hivemapper also poses privacy concerns. Seidman said the company blurs faces and license plates, encrypts location data, anonymizes users and swears off surveillance.

Google licenses imagery from a managed fleet of camera-equipped vehicles. Hivemapper wants to match Google's quality and undercut it on price.

Google did not respond to a request for comment.

By comparison, Mapillary, acquired by Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) in 2020, encourages people to capture imagery through phones and dashcams, but without compensation.

Mapmaker HERE, owned in part by German automakers, is evaluating Hivemapper's imagery for potential use, including for up-to-date speed limit data. European rules since July have required speeding warnings inside cars.

In tests in Manila, Hivemapper covered 95% of roads in six months and updated 75% of the data monthly.

One early customer is Shreveport, Louisiana, which is paying roughly $7,000 for full coverage in its limits from dashcams on garbage trucks, said the city's chief technology officer, Keith Hanson. He called it an inexpensive way to aid response to resident complaints.

591,META,2022-12-22,India panel recommends digital competition act to rein in Big Tech,"













MUMBAI, Dec 22 (Reuters) - An Indian parliamentary panel on Thursday recommended the government enact a digital competition act to regulate anti-competitive business practices by Big Tech companies on its platforms.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has had strained relations with many large technology companies, and New Delhi has been tightening the regulation of firms such as Facebook (META.O), YouTube (GOOGL.O) and Twitter.

Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Apple (AAPL.O) have in the past faced scrutiny from the country's competition watchdog, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), over alleged abuse of the application market.

""The Committee recommend that the government should consider and introduce a digital competition act to ensure a fair, transparent and contestable digital ecosystem, which will be a boon not only for our country and its nascent start-up economy but also for the entire world,"" the panel said in a report submitted in India's lower house of parliament.

The panel recommended the identification of top tech players as systemically important digital intermediaries to counter monopoly and warned they ""must not favour its own offers over the offers of its competitors"" when acting as mediators to supply and sales markets.

In India, Amazon (AMZN.O) and rival Flipkart are facing accusations of anti-competitive practices, such as promoting preferred sellers on websites and giving priority to listings by some sellers.

Companies including Facebook (META.O), Twitter and Google (GOOGL.O) have for years been concerned with many regulations India has proposed for the technology sector, with companies complaining about excessive compliance burdens. The complaints have sometimes strained relations between New Delhi and Washington.

Amazon, Google, Meta, Twitter and Apple did not immediately respond to request for comment.

A specialised digital markets unit should be established within the competition watchdog, the panel said, adding that competitive behaviour of big tech companies needs to be monitored in advance and not after markets become monopolised.

592,META,2022-10-18,New Adobe software tools aim to aid 3D content creation for metaverse,"













Oct 18 (Reuters) - Adobe Inc (ADBE.O) on Tuesday released a set of new software tools designed to make it easier to create three-dimensional digital objects for marketing campaigns, video games and the metaverse.

With its graphic design and photo editing tools, Adobe has long dominated the market for two-dimensional content creation, a position it sought to protect when it spent $20 billion in cash and stock last month to buy rival upstart Figma in the biggest buyout ever of a privately held software firm.

But in recent years Adobe has also invested in creating three-dimensional content, a field dominated by video-game centric firms like Unity Software Inc (U.N). Such content is expected to factor prominently in the metaverse, the virtual world that Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and others are counting on for future revenue growth.

But three-dimensional objects have long been labor-intensive for artists to create, and Adobe on Tuesday released two tools designed to make it faster and easier to make the digital objects.

Adobe's ""3D Capture"" tool lets users take a series photos of a real-world object with nearly any camera - including smartphones - and then melds the photos together into a three-dimensional digital object. An early use of the software will be for e-commerce, where, for example, a shoe seller could let users with augmented reality virtually try on sneakers to see how they look on their feet, said François Cottin, senior director of marketing for Substance 3D and metaverse at Adobe.

""It's only with augmented reality and with 3D that you can do that,"" Cottin said.

The second Adobe tool released Tuesday allows artists to switch between editing a three-dimensional object on a desktop computer to manipulating it with their hands in a virtual reality headset. The software lets virtual artists get a similar feeling to sculpting clay, which remains in use designing cars and other objects, while also having the precision of working on a computer, Cottin said.

""Jumping from one to another is extremely, extremely useful,"" Cottin said.

593,META,2023-02-06,Pinterest fails to pique Wall Street interest with downbeat forecast,"













Feb 6 (Reuters) - Image-sharing platform Pinterest Inc reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue on Monday joining peers Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Snap Inc (SNAP.N) in sounding the alarm on a still-weak ad market.

Shares of the company, which projected tepid first-quarter sales growth, pared losses and were down 3% in extended trading after falling 15%.

Advertisers have slashed their marketing budgets over the past few months as high inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes from global central banks have put a dampener on economic outlook.

After a challenging 2022 in which advertising-dependent companies faced shrinking budgets and cratering stock prices, fourth-quarter results this week from Alphabet to Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) showed they were not yet in the clear.

Pinterest said it expected revenue to grow in low-single-digits in the first quarter, compared with estimates of about 7% growth, according to Refinitiv data.

Chief Financial Officer Todd Morgenfeld, who is set to leave the company on July 1, warned Pinterest expects weakness to persist among U.S. small and medium business and mid-market advertisers in the first quarter as they continue to face ""outsized challenges"".

The company had taken cost cutting measures including reductions to recruiting staff and closures of some smaller and less utilized office spaces to reduce its expense profile in 2023, Morgenfeld added.

""The bigger story is on the cost cutting side of things where we expect the previously announced job cuts to support meaningful margin expansion through 2023,"" said Angelo Zino, analyst at CFRA Research.

The company's global monthly active users (MAUs) grew 4% to 450 million, but fell below estimates of 452.3 million.

Pinterest said its board authorized a share repurchase program of up to $500 million of its Class A common stock over the next 12 months.

The company's revenue in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 grew 4% to $877 million. Analysts on average had expected $886.3 million.

Excluding items, Pinterest posted a profit of 29 cents per share against analyst estimates of 27 cents.

June 16 (Reuters) - A Moscow court on Thursday said it had fined Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O) 15 million roubles ($260,000) for repeatedly failing to comply with a Russian law requiring technology companies to localise user data.

Russia has issued multiple fines to foreign technology companies in recent years over a range of infringements, in what critics say is Moscow's attempt to exert greater control over the internet.

Google declined to comment.

Russia has restricted access to Twitter (TWTR.N) and Meta Platforms Incs' <(META.O) flagship social networks, Facebook and Instagram, but Google and its YouTube video hosting service, though under pressure, remain available for now. Moscow particularly objects to YouTube's treatment of Russian media, which it has blocked. But Anton Gorelkin, deputy head of the State Duma committee on information policy, said the U.S. company was not yet at risk of meeting the same fate. ""Blocking is an extreme measure and YouTube and Google have not crossed this line of reasonableness, but they are involved in the information war against Russia,"" Gorelkin told reporters at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum.

Moscow's Tagansky District Court said it had imposed the fine for what it described as Google's repeated failure to store the personal data of Russian users in databases on Russian territory. Google moved some employees out of Russia after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in late February.

Photo-sharing application LikeMe was fined 1.5 million roubles for a first-time offence. LikeMe could not be reached for comment. Google's ability to pay could be hampered as its Russian subsidiary announced plans to file for bankruptcy in May after authorities seized its bank account. read more Gorelkin said Google could not be a global leader without operations in China and pointed to Yandex (YNDX.O), often referred to as Russia's answer to Google, as a viable competitor. ""I am certain that Google will stay in Russia if it does not cross the line,"" he said.

REUTERS/Tatyana Makeyeva















April 1 (Reuters) - A television channel owned by a sanctioned Russian businessman said on Friday that bailiffs had seized 1 billion roubles ($12 million) from Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google over the U.S. tech giant's failure to restore access to its YouTube account.

Google did not respond to emailed requests for comment. Russia's Federal Bailiffs Service did not immediately reply.

The case forms part of Moscow's wider pressure campaign on Big Tech that has escalated into a battle to control information flows since Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Russia has restricted access to Twitter (TWTR.N) and Meta Platforms Inc's (FB.O) flagship platforms, Facebook and Instagram. YouTube, facing regular demands and threats from state communications regulator Roskomnadzor, may soon meet the same fate. read more

Tsargrad TV, a Christian Orthodox channel owned by businessman Konstantin Malofeev, last month said Google had lost a court appeal against a 2021 ruling that the company pay a daily 100,000 rouble fine for blocking the channel's YouTube account. read more

The Moscow Arbitration Court said last year the daily fine would double each week that Google failed to comply. Tsargrad, which calls itself a patriotic Russian channel, said the fine would stop compounding when it hit 1 billion roubles, a level it reached in mid March. From September, that limit will be removed.

The United States and European Union imposed sanctions on Malofeev in 2014 over accusations that he funded pro-Moscow separatists fighting in Ukraine, something he denies. Russia considers such Western sanctions illegal.

Tsargrad said it had received the 1 billion roubles and warned it would seek money from Google abroad, should the company continue to violate Russian law, a threat it has made before.

""Tsargrad will send the 1 billion seized today to support Russia's special military operation to de-Nazify and demilitarise Ukraine,"" Tsargrad said.

Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its troops.

596,META,2022-11-09,Shares in Apple supplier Goertek tumble after client suspends order,"













HONG KONG, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Shares in Goertek Inc (002241.SZ) tumbled on Wednesday after the China-based electronics supplier said an overseas client had asked it to suspend assembly work for a smart acoustic product, which analysts identified as the Apple AirPods Pro 2.

Goertek said late on Tuesday it had received the notice from a ""major overseas client"". The suspension would impact up to 3.3 billion yuan ($455 million) in revenue, equivalent to about 4.2% of the company's total revenue in 2021, it said.

Shares in Goertek fell by their maximum, triggering a trading suspension in accordance with exchange rules.

In a note to clients, analysts from Jefferies said their inquiries had revealed that the product was the AirPods Pro 2, a wireless earphone set.

""The issue is more of a technical one, instead of a demand problem,"" Jefferies analysts wrote, adding that both Goertek and Luxshare had been impacted.

Another Apple supplier, Luxshare (002475.SZ), had been able to quickly fix the problem and resume production, but Goertek was still in the process of overcoming the difficulty, working with an Apple engineering team on site, they said.

""At the moment, there are no order cuts or Goertek being so-called 'kicked out' of the customer's supply chain,"" they said.

Ming-Chi Kuo, an Apple analyst at research firm TF Securities, said that, according to his checks, the product involved could be AirPods Pro 2. ""Goertek's suspension of production is more likely due to production issues rather than demand issues,"" he said.

Apple and Goertek, whose clients also include Meta Platforms (META.O), Samsung and Microsoft, did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

Shares in Luxshare (002475.SZ) and AAC Technologies (2018.HK) initially jumped as high as 4.6% and 14.6%, respectively, before paring gains. The two companies were up about 0.3% and 2.6%, respectively, near the end of the afternoon session.

Sept 20 (Reuters) - Twitter (TWTR.N) is expanding how it recommends posts from accounts that users do not follow, the social media company announced on Tuesday.

As part of the expansion, it is also building tools for users to control and provide feedback on that content.

""With millions of people signing up for Twitter every day, we want to make it easier for everyone to connect with accounts and Topics that interest them,"" Twitter said in a blog post.

The tests come as social media companies double down this year on what they call ""unconnected content,"" or posts from accounts users do not follow, after short video app TikTok shot to prominence relying entirely on algorithm-driven suggestions.

Among the new designs Twitter has been testing is placement of ""related tweets"" below conversations on a tweet detail page, said Angela Wise, a senior director of product management responsible for ""discovery"" on the service.

Twitter is also experimenting with an ""X"" tool that users may click to remove recommended tweets they do not like from their timelines, the blog post said.

Competitor Meta Platforms (META.O) is aiming to double the percentage of recommended content that fills its users' feeds on Facebook and Instagram by the end of 2023, it disclosed in July. read more

Twitter is making less of a wholesale shift than that, having embraced recommended tweets in its home timeline as far back as 2014, although at least some of its redesigns likewise include nods to TikTok.

In one recent experiment presenting a choice between algorithmic and chronological versions of its home timeline, it renamed the algorithmic version ""For You,"" the same as TikTok's main page, for example.

Twitter's Wise said the company's discovery efforts were largely aimed at new users, who have yet to figure out which accounts to follow and generally send the company fewer signals about their interests than do prolific longtime tweeters.

Some users have complained about ""related tweets"" exposing them to irrelevant hyperpartisan content and creating confusion over which tweets were part of a conversation and which were suggested by algorithm.

598,META,2022-04-05,"Canada introduces legislation to compel Facebook, Google to pay for news","













April 5 (Reuters) - Canada on Tuesday laid out details of a proposed legislation that would compel platforms like Facebook and Google to negotiate commercial deals and pay news publishers for their content, in a move similar to Australia's ground-breaking law passed last year.

""The news sector in Canada is in crisis,"" Canadian Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez said at a news conference, introducing the bill put forward by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government.

The ""Online News Act,"" or House of Commons bill C-18, will require digital platforms that have a bargaining imbalance, measured by metrics like a firm's global revenue, with news businesses to make fair deals, that would then be assessed by a regulator.

If such deals do not meet a set of criteria detailed in the act, the platforms would have to go through mandatory bargaining and final offer arbitration processes overseen by the Canadian Radio‑television and Telecommunications regulator.

The law would work similarly to the one in Australia, which made it mandatory for Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Meta Platforms-owned (FB.O) Facebook to pay media companies for content on their platforms in reforms that have been heralded as a model for others to copy.

Canada's news media industry has pressed against Facebook and asked the government for more regulation of tech companies, to allow the industry to recoup financial losses it has suffered in the years that Facebook and Google have been steadily gaining greater market shares of advertising.

More than 450 news outlets in Canada have closed since 2008, including 64 closures in the last two years.

Facebook and Google have voluntarily agreed to invest around C$1 billion each, over three years, on journalism initiatives globally. Rodriguez said the government held discussions with both firms.

""They were open to regulations ... those conversations were very frank, honest and nice,"" he said.

Both Google and Facebook, in separate statements, said they were reviewing the proposed legislation and looked forward to working with the government.

The legislation would cover news businesses operating in Canada, including newspapers and news magazines with a digital presence, and allow them to bargain individually as well as in groups.

LONDON, April 28 (Reuters) - Cryptoassets could be seized to help combat economic crime, Britain's government said on Thursday, but its proposal stopped short of the radical overhaul called for by lawmakers who want a single crime-busting agency.

Banking and online scams have rocketed in Britain, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic. read more

The government said in its response to a parliamentary inquiry into economic crime that it will bring forward legislation to enable cryptoassets to be seized and recovered more quickly, as soon as parliamentary time allows.

""In particular, (we propose) the creation of a civil forfeiture power which would mitigate the risk posed by those that cannot be prosecuted but use their funds to further criminality,"" the government told parliament's Treasury Select Committee.

The inquiry had recommended a single body for tackling economic crime to replace a ""bewildering"" number of agencies, but the government said its multi-agency approach was the right one.

""It enables us to differentiate between different crime types,"" the government said, adding that fraud in the public sector needed a different response to scams committed by people or businesses.

""This may be a significant missed opportunity,"" TSC Chair Mel Stride said in a statement.

The government has already backed a recommendation to require online platforms like Google and Facebook to proactively tackle fraudulent advertising for financial products, but it will take time to pass and implement the legislation.

""Online platforms must now step up and urgently take down these fraudulent adverts,"" Stride said.

Google has already agreed to take financial promotions only from companies regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, with Facebook owner Meta due to follow suit this year.

The inquiry recommended forcing online platforms to help compensate customers hit by scams, a step the government is not ruling out.

""We are working closely with technology companies and partners in law enforcement and civil society to consider every possible option to support victims of online fraud and to mitigate the harm that they have experienced,"" the government said.

HONG KONG, Dec 30 (Reuters Breakingviews) - This year has not been short on drama. Our best-read stories of 2022 are testament to that.

Elon Musk’s will-they-or-won’t-they Twitter debacle kept readers on tenterhooks via Refinitiv’s platforms and our two websites, Breakingviews.com and Reuters.com. Among those headlines, a column listing the many reasons why he might not seal the deal proved to be our most popular story of the year, even though the entrepreneur ultimately decided to do it anyway. Another piece posing the hard-hitting question, “What is Morgan Stanley (MS.N) smoking in Twitter LBO?”, garnered plenty of clicks on Breakingviews.com and via Refinitiv.

Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine thrust Russia into the spotlight. Almost a third of the best-read lists tackled the outbreak of war in Europe, and its terrible ramifications. Views on the rouble and the prospect of the country’s economic collapse demanded attention. Its impact on China, India and beyond was a recurrent theme. The seismic shock to oil and energy markets was another.

Deals are a perennial favourite. This year was no exception. Two of our annual predictions, envisaging that Mark Zuckerberg will break up Meta Platforms (META.O), and that Microsoft (MSFT.O) will buy Netflix (NFLX.O), respectively, climbed to the best-read list on Reuters.com just as this piece went to press. A persuasive pitch for breaking up Chinese technology titan Tencent (0700.HK) caused a stir across multiple platforms earlier in the year.

On Breakingviews.com, readers were more inclined to plunge into longer, analytical articles, including a column explaining why it’s time to worry about Greece again, and a deep dive into the financial black hole otherwise known as zero-interest rates. A tasty mix of puns and crunchy arguments helped our coverage of food delivery group Just Eat Takeaway.com’s (TKWY.AS) post-deal indigestion to go down a treat. The sorry story of leveraged-finance bankers’ $1.5 billion writedowns also hit the spot.

On Refinitiv’s news services, a crisis at Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), surging inflation, nail-biting U.S. midterms, and Wall Street job cuts were among the other fast-moving stories to grab eyeballs.

Must-reads were without a doubt the driver for our most-read lists in 2023.

601,META,2022-11-11,Twitter gives big advertisers the excuse they need,"













NEW YORK, Nov 11 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Twitter’s new owner Elon Musk is making it too easy to hit the pause on ad spending. General Motors (GM.N), Mondelez International (MDLZ.O), Pfizer (PFE.N) and Interpublic Group (IPG.N) are just some of the companies and agencies suspending their ad dollars on the social media network because of brand safety issues. Eli Lilly (LLY.N) had to apologize on Thursday for a fake account – verified with a blue check no less – that tweeted out a message announcing free insulin. This latest chapter will be hard for Twitter to overcome.

Social media companies are no stranger to ad boycotts. Meta Platform’s (META.O) Facebook two years ago was targeted by the likes of Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and Unilever (ULVR.L) because they were concerned about toxic content. Yet, Mark Zuckerberg’s outfit managed to increase its advertising revenue 20% in 2020 compared to 2019. That’s because Facebook and Instagram rely more on small business advertising, which is a diverse scattered group.

Twitter reaps almost all its revenue from big brands, and those big advertisers are already looking for an excuse to put the brakes on spending. Even high flying TikTok slashed its ad target by $2 billion this year, according to Bloomberg. Musk is just giving them an out. (By Jennifer Saba)

602,META,2022-05-09,"Uber to cut costs, slow down hiring, CEO tells staff","













May 9 (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N) will scale back hiring and reduce expenditure on its marketing and incentive activities, according to a letter from Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi seen by Reuters.

The ride-hailing company becomes the latest to rein in costs to have a lean investment model, after Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) said last week it would slow down the growth of its workforce. read more

Khosrowshahi said Uber's change in strategy was a necessary response to the ""seismic shift"" in investor sentiment, CNBC first reported earlier Monday.

""The least efficient marketing and incentive spend will be pulled back. We will treat hiring as a privilege and be deliberate about when and where we add headcount,"" the report quoted Khosrowshahi as saying.

Uber said last week its driver base is at a post-pandemic high, and the company expects this to continue without significant incentive investments, a sharp contrast to rival Lyft Inc (LYFT.O) which has said it needs to spend more for labor. read more

The company will now focus on achieving profitability on a free cash flow basis, rather than adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, according to the CNBC report.

During the company's annual shareholder meeting on Monday, Khosrowshahi addressed investors' concerns.

""What we can do at Uber is to continue to execute in terms of top line, bottom line profitability,"" the CEO said, adding that the company's results and guidance surpassed analyst expectations. ""We share your frustration.""

Uber shares have lost more than 43% since going public in 2019.

The company expects to generate ""meaningful positive cash flows"" for the full year, according to its latest earnings report.

Khosrowshahi added in his letter that Uber's food delivery and freight businesses need to grow faster, the CNBC report added.

Uber did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.

603,META,2022-10-26,Credit Suisse's possible First Boston revival may face hurdles,"













NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse may want to revive the First Boston brand for its investment bank - but doing so could be complicated and possibly costly.

The embattled Swiss lender is set to announce a reorganization on Thursday which could include selling various parts of its business as it tries to raise cash. The bank could also spin off or separate part of its advisory and investment banking business.

A source familiar with the matter said the bank is considering rebranding its investment bank using First Boston as part of that reorganization, confirming reports in Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal.

However, a number of other companies or entities have been using the First Boston brand.

The source said Credit Suisse has been making efforts to reclaim the First Boston brand since retiring it years ago. It was unclear whether Credit Suisse would be happy to co-exist with the other First Boston brands.

Credit Suisse declined comment.

Among entities using the brand is website Firstboston.net which advertises itself as ""the first call for acquisitions."" When contacted by Reuters, FirstBoston.net said via email that it was not affiliated with Credit Suisse and declined comment on whether Credit Suisse had contacted it. A representative listed on the United States Patent and Trademark Office under the First Boston trademark filing did not respond to a request for comment.

Another company with First Boston branding is First Boston Advisors, an investment banking advisory business previously branded as Methuselah Advisors. The firm is owned by former First Boston bankers who have advised on major media and digital deals. A representative for the firm did not respond to a request for comment.

First Boston Capital Partners, a homebuilding financing company, also includes the First Boston name. A representative did not respond to a request for comment.

Still, while the USPTO database is good evidence of whether a person or entity owns a trademark, it is not conclusive, according to a lawyer who declined to be identified due to confidentiality.

A person or entity could be using a trademark under license, the lawyer said. In addition, U.S. trademark rights generally derive from the use of the trademark in the marketplace. If a person or entity abandons a brand name, they lose the rights whether they own the piece of paper or not, that lawyer said.

Buying rights can be expensive. Meta Platforms Inc , the owner of social media network Facebook, was behind a $60 million deal to acquire the trademark assets of U.S. regional bank Meta Financial Group (CASH.O) in December, according to spokespeople at the time.

CREDIT SUISSE AND FIRST BOSTON'S HISTORY

Credit Suisse's history with the First Boston investment bank dates back to 1978 when the pair linked up to operate in the London bond market. In 1988 they announced a merger to increase the Swiss bank's presence on Wall Street, creating CS First Boston. That was followed by a tough time for First Boston which had suffered the loss of famed bankers Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella.

However, in June 2005 the bank said it would adopt a single Credit Suisse brand for its banking business. In its 2005 annual report it said the brand name Credit Suisse First Boston was no longer used.

""The argument they would likely make is (First Boston) comes with market recognition that they might find helpful with certain associations really intrinsic to investment banking,"" said Melanie McShane, Executive Director, Strategy at brand company Siegel+Gale.

If Credit Suisse did indeed revive the brand, it would not be the first bank to make such a move. Kingswood Capital Markets bought the rights to use the bulge bracket bank brand EF Hutton in 2021 while Salomon Encore describes itself as a ""Modern Salomon Brothers"". The original Salomon Brothers was an investment bank that revolutionized bond trading in the 1980s and whose CEO was dubbed the ""King of Wall Street.""

McShane said that reviving First Boston would probably see Credit Suisse ""try and brush over that the brand was abandoned.""

""I'd speculate a lot of this is about employee retention... and retaining the best dealmakers,"" said McShane.

604,META,2022-11-22,HP to cut about 12% jobs by end of fiscal 2025,"













Nov 22 (Reuters) - HP Inc (HPQ.N) said on Tuesday it expects to cut up to 6,000 jobs by the end of fiscal 2025, or about 12% of its global workforce, at a time when sales of personal computers and laptops are sliding as shoppers tighten budgets.

The PC maker also forecast a lower-than-expected profit for the first quarter as it expects softness in both consumer and commercial demand.

""Many of the recent challenges we have seen in FY'22 will likely continue into FY'23,"" said chief financial officer Marie Myers during a post-earnings call.

HP estimates it will incur about $1.0 billion in labor and non-labor costs related to restructuring and other charges, with nearly $600 million in fiscal 2023 and the rest split between the following two years.

The company, which employs nearly 50,000 people, said it expects to reduce headcount between 4,000 and 6,000.

The restructuring comes at a time when most companies including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Facebook's parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) are making deep cuts to their employee base to navigate a potential downturn in the economy.

HP forecast current-quarter profit between 70 cents and 80 cents. Analysts on average expect 86 cents, according to Refinitiv data.

PC sales have shrunk from the heights hit during the pandemic as households and businesses reduce spending in the face of decades-high inflation, putting pressure on companies such as HP and Dell Technologies Inc (DELL.N).

Earlier on Monday, Dell reported a 6% fall in third-quarter revenue. The company's Chief financial officer Tom Sweet said the ongoing macroeconomic factors including inflation and rising interest rates would weigh on customers next year.

HP also reported a 11% fall in fourth-quarter revenue to $14.8 billion.

Shares of the Palo Alto, California-based company were up nearly 2% in extended trading.

605,META,2022-07-20,"UK teens shun traditional news for TikTok, Instagram - regulator","













LONDON, July 21 (Reuters) - Teenagers in Britain are increasingly turning to social media platforms such as Instagram, TikTok and YouTube for news and are moving away from traditional outlets, media regulator Ofcom said in a report on Thursday.

Ofcom’s latest report on news consumption in Britain outlined how a range of age groups consumed news differently and showed for the first time that Instagram was the most popular news source among teenagers.

Replacing more traditional news sources, 29% of teens used Meta Platform Inc's (META.O) Instagram to follow the news while TikTok and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) YouTube were also used by 28% of teenagers for news.

Across platforms, TikTok saw the largest growth in use of any news source in Britain, mainly driven by younger age groups, with half its news users aged 16 to 24, the report said.

Users on TikTok also received more of their news on the platform from ""other people they follow"" than from news organisations, the report added.

“Teenagers today are increasingly unlikely to pick up a newspaper or tune into TV news, instead preferring to keep up-to-date by scrolling through their social feeds,"" Ofcom’s Group Director for Strategy and Research Yih-Choung Teh said.

Despite TikTok's popularity, Ofcom's report said in those aged 12-15, it was only trusted by three out of 10 who used it for news content.

While 12- to 15-year-olds remained more sceptical about news on social media than other sources, half of those who used YouTube and Twitter (TWTR.N) for news did trust them.

Overall TV news remained the most trusted news source in Britain, with Sky News and BBC trusted by their viewers for news while news on social media was considered the least reliable.

Not all social media platforms fared as well. The report showed that the proportion of teenagers using Facebook for news fell to 22% from 27% last year, continuing a decline since 2018.

606,META,2022-04-22,Take Five: April showers earnings and elections,"













April 25 (Reuters) - From HSBC and Volvo in Europe to Apple and McDonalds on Wall Street, first-quarter earnings are coming in thick and fast. But will they give lacklustre stock markets a lift?

In France, a Marine Le Pen presidency has not come to pass, with Emmanuel Macron winning the Sunday's election.Now the wait is on to see for another event which in January had seemed impossible -- a Russian sovereign debt default.

Here's a look at the week ahead in markets from Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, Saqib Ahmed in New York, Danilo Masoni in Milan, and Dhara Ranasinghe and Karin Strohecker in London.

1/ VIVE LA FRANCE

French President Emmanuel Macron defeated his far-right rival Marine Le Pen on Sunday by a comfortable margin, securing a second term and heading off what would have been a political earthquake. read more

The news is a relief for markets, boosting the euro, French bonds and stocks. But gains will likely be short-lived, as focus returns to the outlook for tighter ECB policy and the outcome of French parliamentary elections in June. read more

That Macron's problems are far from over, was shown late on Sunday when riot police charged and sprayed teargas on people protesting in central Paris after the election.

2/ TRUE DOVE

Ahead of Thursday's policy meeting, the Bank of Japan has left no doubt about its commitment to supercharged stimulus, leaping into markets to defend its 0% bond yield target -- even at the expense of a plunging currency.

The contrast between the BOJ and the hawkish Federal Reserve is at the heart of the yen's tumble to a two-decade trough near 130 per dollar .

The yen's 11% fall in the course of a month has prompted warnings from finance minister Shunichi Suzuki against rapid depreciation, putting markets on alert for an intervention. But BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has stuck to the view that yen weakness overall is a positive for Japan.

The IMF seems to agree. A senior official said yen moves were down to fundamentals and there was no need to change policy, including the BOJ's ultra-low rate stance read more .

3/ TECH TROUBLE

It's been a gloomy year so far for U.S. stocks and for tech firms, and the ongoing results season could make it worse.

Netflix's share rout after reporting falling subscriber numbers has sparked trepidation about upcoming earnings from Facebook-parent Meta (FB.O), Google-parent Alphabet . Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) read more .

This so-called FAANG grouping benefited hugely from the low-rate, work-from-home environment. But with interest rates on the rise, their shares have cumulatively lost some $2.5 trillion in market value this year.

Overall S&P 500 earnings are projected to expand 6.3%. But Apple quarterly adjusted earnings-per-share are seen growing by just 2% versus the year-ago period, while a 0.7% dip is expected at Alphabet. And EPS declines at Amazon and Meta could be as much as 49% and 24% respectively, Refinitiv data shows.

4/ EUROPE INC: EARNINGS AND INFLATION

As the Ukraine war rages, European companies' full-year earnings revisions -- the number of upgrades minus downgrades -- have turned negative the first time since October 2020 read more .

Q1 earnings growth will still be 25%, Refinitiv projects, possibly enough to lift a bearishly positioned market. Yet, with more than 140 companies unveiling earnings during the April 25-29 week, there are questions over cost pressures and whether these can be passed to consumers.

Giants such as Nestle (NESN.S) and Danone (DANO.PA) managed to grow Q1 earnings while raising prices, but smaller peers may struggle to do so read more .

Leading banks, including UBS, Deutsche, HSBC and Barclays also report; after a disappointing Q1 share performance, the prospect of higher rates is now lifting the sector.

5/ OLD JOB, NEW PROBLEMS

Russian central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina starts her new five-year term in charge of monetary policy with a big to-do list: dealing with a full-scale crisis caused by unprecedented and ever widening Western sanctions. read more

The economy is expected to suffer its steepest contraction since the years following the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, Russia is on the cusp of debt default and annual inflation has soared past 20% read more .

Still, Nabiullina may cut interest rates on Friday, possibly by 200 basis points, from the current 17%. That will partly reverse the emergency rate hike the central bank was forced into after the Kremlin's February 24 invasion of Ukraine. read more

Rate-setters are also expected to discuss lifting capital controls, and the need to recapitalise some banks.

607,META,2022-10-26,TikTok immune from lawsuit over girl's death from 'blackout challenge' -judge,"













Oct 26 (Reuters) - TikTok Inc won dismissal of a lawsuit accusing it of causing the death of a 10-year-old girl by promoting a deadly ""blackout challenge"" that encouraged people to choke themselves on its video-based social media platform.

U.S. District Judge Paul Diamond in Philadelphia ruled Tuesday that the company was immune from the lawsuit under a part of the federal Communications Decency Act that shields publishers of others' work.

""The wisdom of conferring such immunity is something properly taken up with Congress, not the courts,"" Diamond wrote.

Jeffrey Goodman, a lawyer for the girl's mother, Tawainna Anderson, said in a statement that the family would ""continue to fight to make social media safe so that no other child is killed by the reckless behavior of the social media industry.""

TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Anderson sued TikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance Inc in May, saying the company's algorithm showed her daughter, Nylah Anderson, a video suggesting the blackout challenge.

In December 2021, Nylah attempted the blackout challenge using a purse strap hung in her mother's closet, losing consciousness and suffering severe injuries, according to the lawsuit. She was rushed to a hospital but died five days later.

TikTok and ByteDance moved to dismiss the case, saying that under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, they could not be held liable for publishing third-party content. Diamond, while saying that the circumstances were ""tragic,"" agreed.

TikTok and other social media companies, including Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and YouTube parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), are facing a growing number of lawsuits around the country seeking to hold them liable for causing young people to become addicted to their products, and in some cases causing harm including eating disorders, self-injury and suicide.

A federal judicial panel earlier this month consolidated dozens of such cases in a new mass tort in a federal court in Oakland, California.

608,META,2022-12-29,BC Partners to acquire account-based marketing firm Madison Logic,"













NEW YORK, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Private equity firm BC Partners said on Thursday it has agreed to acquire a majority stake in Madison Logic, a provider of business-to-business digital marketing services.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but a person familiar with the matter told Reuters the transaction valued Madison Logic at about $750 million.

BC Partners is acquiring Madison Logic from Clarion Capital Partners, a New York-based private equity firm that had acquired the company in 2016.

Clarion as well as Madison Logic executives including chief executive Tom O'Regan and co-founders Vin Turk and Erik Matlick will remain minority shareholders in the company following the BC Partners acquisition.

Madison Logic helps businesses track and target enterprise customers with digital marketing to generate sales. The New York-based company was founded in 2005 and has about 250 customers, including Amazon (AMZN.O), Google owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Adobe Inc (ADBE.O), Microsoft Inc (MSFT.O) and Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O).

Spending on business-to-business digital marketing constitutes a small but growing part of the nearly $300 billion U.S. digital advertising market.

Madison Logic competes with TechTarget Inc (TTGT.O) for market share in the U.S. business-to-business advertising sector, which is expected to grow by 15% to $16.5 billion in 2023, according to market research firm eMarketer.

""Within digital marketing, Madison Logic is focused on the business-to-business segment, which is typically less affected than the business-to-customer segment in a recession,"" BC Partners chairman Raymond Svider said in an interview.

""We believe Madison Logic has room for continued organic growth; they can continue to expand beyond existing technology clients into other verticals such as healthcare and industrials; and there could potentially be acquisitions,"" Svider added.

Based in London, BC Partners manages more than $41 billion in assets spread across healthcare, technology, financial services and industrials in Europe and North America.

Summary

Summary Companies Google shocks market with weaker-than-estimated ad revenue

SK Hynix warns chip sector facing 'unprecdented deterioration'

Weak earnings come amid soaring inflation, interest rate hikes















Oct 26 (Reuters) - U.S. companies from tech giants Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft to GE (GE.N) and toymaker Mattel (MAT.O) reported big slowdowns in growth or warned things were going to get worse, fanning recession fears and driving down stocks.

The gloomy reports spilled into Asia on Wednesday, with South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS) saying the memory chip market is facing ""unprecedented deterioration"" and it plans to cut investment next year by more than 50%. Its third-quarter profit plunged 60%.

South Korean flat-screen maker LG Display Co Ltd (034220.KS) posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss.

The rash of disappointing results points to a host of problems in the global economy, including soaring inflation and interest rate hikes that have battered consumer demand.

U.S. consumer confidence ebbed in October, data showed Tuesday, after two straight monthly increases, amid heightened inflation concerns and worries of a possible recession next year.

After years of turbo-charged growth, Microsoft posted its slowest rise in sales in five years and Google parent Alphabet grew just 6% last quarter, its slowest pace since September 2013 barring a small quarterly decline in 2020.

Google, which many had expected to be more resilient because of its status as the world's largest digital advertising platform by market share, shocked the market with weaker-than-estimated advertising revenue as customers in the insurance, mortgages and cryptocurrencies industries tightened their ad budgets.

""Despite being seen as one of the most insulated companies in the advertising space relative to peers, Google's poor quarter is the latest sign that worsening fundamentals and a tough macroeconomic environment are prompting advertisers to cut back on spending,"" said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.

Google's results bode ill for Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META.O), which is especially reliant on advertising and reports results on Wednesday. Last week, its smaller rival Snap Inc (SNAP.N) forecast no revenue growth for the holiday quarter, setting off warning bells in the social media industry.

Alphabet said it plans to cut hiring by more than half.

Conglomerate GE, which is in the process of breaking up into three companies, said it will reduce global headcount by a fifth at its onshore wind unit, which has been battling higher raw material costs due to inflation and supply-chain pressures.

Shares in Alphabet slumped 7% in trading after the bell. Microsoft fell 2% and chipmaker Texas Instruments , which forecast quarterly revenue and profit below estimates, was down 5%. Shares in Spotify (SPOT.N), which also warned on slow advertising growth, slid 4%. Meta shares fell 4%.

BRIGHT SPOTS

A lack of demand for personal computers and laptops was evident in Microsoft's past quarter as its Windows business slumped 15%, a sharp turnaround after months of pandemic-fueled sales driven by people working and studying from home.

Texas Instruments (TI) echoed the sentiment, backing up similar predictions from fellow chipmakers Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) earlier this month.

""During the quarter we experienced expected weakness in personal electronics and expanding weakness across industrial,"" said TI boss Rich Templeton. The company, like other chipmakers, has to contend with gadget makers cutting orders to clear stockpiles of chips after the pandemic-led boost in demand quickly flipped to a slump in a matter of weeks.

Weak demand for consumer electronics has also been flagged by Apple (AAPL.O) iPhone assembler Foxconn (2317.TW) as China's economy has slowed dramatically on COVID 19-related curbs.

Mattel, which is very susceptible to discretionary spending cuts, lowered its profit forecast for the year and said it would ramp up promotions heading into the busy holiday season to encourage inflation-hit shoppers to buy its Barbie dolls.

Earlier on Tuesday, post-it maker 3M Co said it expected weak consumer spending to continue into the upcoming holiday season and cut its full-year forecasts.

Still, there were bright spots in other report cards.

Tesla Inc supplier LG Energy Solution Ltd (LGES) (373220.KS) swung to a profit in the third quarter on strong electric vehicle (EV) battery demand and favourable foreign exchange rates.

Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N) reported quarterly sales and profits that topped the Street as wealthier customers chowed down on their burritos despite higher prices even as lower-income consumers ate there less often.

Coca-Cola Co , a favorite in a slowdown, joined rival PepsiCo Inc in lifting its annual forecasts, as customers bought their sugary sodas despite multiple rounds of price hikes.

610,META,2023-03-01,Alphabet's Waymo cuts more than 100 jobs in second round of layoffs,"













March 1 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) self-driving technology unit, Waymo, laid off 137 employees, in its second round of job cuts this year, the firm told Reuters on Wednesday, bringing total cuts for the year to 8% of its workforce.

Waymo has eliminated some engineering roles as part of the cuts to ""focus on commercial success,"" the company said in a statement. The company has now cut a total of 209 jobs this year.

The job cuts at Waymo are part of wider layoffs across the auto and tech industry, including at Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN.O), General Motors Co (GM.N) and Meta Platforms Inc (META.O).

Companies, in general, have found that developing fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) that can go everywhere has proven harder and more expensive than expected, and prospects of a profitable robotaxi business likely remain several years away.

Investors and industry watchers have been concerned about billions of dollars that have been poured into the self-driving technology sector in a short span of time to commercialize it.

Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) pulled the plug on self-driving unit Argo AI in November. General Motors Co (GM.N) burned through nearly $2 billion in 2022 at its robotaxi unit, Cruise, and said it anticipates spending even more this year.

Activist investor TCI Fund Management said in November that Waymo is the biggest component of the Google-parent's Other Bets segment and it has not justified excessive investment.

Alphabet said in January it would slash 12,000 jobs, which would affect a large number of employees who support experimental projects. Its health science unit, Verily Life Sciences, said in January it had laid off over 200 employees, or about 15% of its workforce.

The online retailer, whose market cap briefly fell below $1 trillion, was last down 8.4% at $101.66, after hitting its lowest since April 2020.

Apple Inc (AAPL.O), however, shone bright amid a crowd of dimming lights in the Big Tech space, as the iPhone maker reported revenue and profit that topped analysts' estimates.

Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta gained between 1.2% and 3.1% after their shares were battered this week following gloomy outlook from the companies.

The Big Tech stocks are on track to lose more than $400 billion this week.

Many view the megacap companies as bellwethers for how corporate America is faring during a year in which inflation has soared, pushing the U.S. Federal Reserve to enact a series of jumbo-sized rate hikes that have bruised markets.

Analysts fear macroeconomic factors, including a strong dollar, will continue to hit Amazon in the near term, however, over a longer period of time, the retailer should be able to bounce back.

""Despite accelerating revenues, Amazon has been cut down to size by the market after missing expectations. Efficiency has yet to return to the e-commerce business,"" Ben Barringer, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said.

While the cloud services segment has been one of high and sustained growth for tech companies, indications for Amazon, Microsoft and Intel Corp (INTC.O) this week point to lower investments as costs rise.

Intel's shares rose about 7% after the chipmaker said its cost-reduction plan includes layoffs and is expected to lower costs by $3 billion next year.

However, analysts are cautious of how the company plans to cut costs.

Cost reductions are necessary, but Intel needs to focus on cutting spending in the right places and keep research and development investments high, Glenn O'Donnell, research director at Forrester, said.

Summary Companies This content was produced in Russia, where the law restricts coverage of Russian military operations in Ukraine















MOSCOW, June 22 (Reuters) - Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google may face a fine of 5-10% of its turnover in Russia for what the state communications regulator said on Wednesday was a repeated failure to delete banned content, including ""misleading information"" on YouTube about events in Ukraine.

This is the second fine based on a percentage of turnover that Google could face Russia. In May, Russian bailiffs seized more than 7.7 billion roubles ($143 million) from Google that it had been ordered to pay late last year, marking the first time Moscow had exacted a percentage of the company's annual Russian turnover. read more

Google, whose Russian subsidiary last week submitted a declaration of bankruptcy, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. read more

""The video hosting site YouTube deliberately promotes the dissemination of misleading information about the progress of the special military operation in Ukraine, discrediting the armed forces of the Russian Federation,"" regulator Roskomnadzor said.

It said the repeat offence could lead to a fine of 5-10% of annual turnover in Russia, with the amount to be determined in court. Reuters calculated that the previous fine equated to just over 8% of turnover.

Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, saying it had to defuse a threat to its security and protect Russian speakers from persecution, in what Moscow calls a ""special military operation"".

Ukraine says it is fighting an illegal land grab by Russia.

Roskomnadzor also said YouTube had permitted content promoting extremist views and calls for children to participate in unauthorised protests.

The regulator said Google has now been fined a total of 68 million roubles, excluding turnover fines, and that more than 7,000 banned items remain on YouTube.

Russia has restricted access to Twitter (TWTR.N) and Meta Platforms' (META.O) flagship social networks Facebook and Instagram, but has not blocked Google.

A State Duma member last week said YouTube and Google had not yet ""crossed the line of reasonableness"", but were involved in the information war against Russia. read more

Russia has issued numerous fines to foreign technology companies in recent years for a range of infringements, in what critics say is an attempt to exert greater control over the internet. ($1 = 53.8800 roubles)

Microsoft Teams/Handout via REUTERS















July 21 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) MS Teams was back up for most users, the company said on Thursday, after an hours-long outage that disrupted the chat application for tens of thousands of customers globally.

The company cited a disruption on a recent software update that ""contained a broken connection to an internal storage service"".

""We're addressing any residual impact related to this event. Additionally, we are monitoring for any signs of failure until we're confident that all functions of the service are fully recovered,"" the company said on its website.

MS Teams, used by more than 270 million people globally, forms an integral part of daily operations for businesses and schools, which use the service to make calls, schedule meetings and organize their workflow.

The company did not disclose the number of users affected by the disruption, but outage tracking website Downdetector.com showed more than 4,800 incidents in the United States and over 18,200 in Japan. The site tracks outages by collating status reports from sources including user-submitted errors on its platform.

During the outage, most users were unable to exchange messages or use any features of the application. Many users took to Twitter to share updates and memes about the service disruption, with #MicrosoftTeams trending as a hashtag on the social media site.

""Microsoft Teams has stopped, and half the working world along with it #MicrosoftTeams,"" a Twitter user said.

Microsoft also confirmed some downstream impacts to multiple Microsoft 365 services with Teams integration, such as Microsoft Word, Office Online and SharePoint Online.

The company has benefited from a surge in demand for remote business teleconferencing and messaging tools, with MS Teams becoming a key fixture for organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic as people worked from homes.

Other big technology companies have also been hit by outages in the past year, with a near six-hour disruption at Meta Platforms (META.O)that kept WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger out of reach for billions of users last October. read more

614,META,2022-08-16,"OK Google, get me a Coke: AI giant demos soda-fetching robots","













MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Aug 16 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google is combining the eyes and arms of physical robots with the knowledge and conversation skills of virtual chatbots to help its employees fetch soda and chips from breakrooms with ease.

The mechanical waiters, shown in action to reporters last week, embody an artificial intelligence breakthrough that paves the way for multipurpose robots as easy to control as ones that perform single, structured tasks such as vacuuming or standing guard.

Google robots are not ready for sale. They perform only a few dozen simple actions, and the company has not yet embedded them with the ""OK, Google"" summoning feature familiar to consumers.

While Google says it is pursuing development responsibly, adoption could ultimately stall over concerns such as robots becoming surveillance machines, or being equipped with chat technology that can give offensive responses, as Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and others have experienced in recent years.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) are pursuing comparable research on robots.

""It's going to take a while before we can really have a firm grasp on the direct commercial impact,"" said Vincent Vanhoucke, senior director for Google's robotics research.

When asked to help clean a spill, Google's robot recognizes that grabbing a sponge is a doable and more sensible response than apologizing for creating the mess.

The robots interpret naturally spoken commands, weigh possible actions against their capabilities and plan smaller steps to achieve the ask.

The chain is made possible by infusing the robots with language technology that draws understanding of the world from Wikipedia, social media and other webpages. Similar AI underlies chatbots or virtual assistants, but has not been applied to robots this expansively before, Google said.

It unveiled the effort in a research paper in April. Incorporating more sophisticated language AI since then boosted the robots' success on commands to 74% from 61%, according a company blog post on Tuesday.

Fellow Alphabet subsidiary Everyday Robots designs the robots, which for now will stay confined to grabbing snacks for employees.

615,META,2022-10-18,Russia fines Amazon over banned content for first time,"Summary

Summary Companies This content was produced in Russia, where the law restricts coverage of Russian military operations in Ukraine.















MOSCOW, Oct 18 (Reuters) - A Moscow court on Tuesday said it had fined Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) 4 million roubles ($65,000) for failing to remove banned content relating to drug use and suicide, the first such penalty in Russia for the U.S. tech giant.

Russia has fined other foreign tech firms for not removing content, part of what critics say is a campaign by the Kremlin to restrict the influence of Western technology companies, especially since Moscow sent its armed forces into Ukraine.

The Tagansky District Court said it had fined Amazon 4 million roubles in two separate cases, although its statement did not specify what these were. It also fined Amazon's streaming service Twitch 8 million roubles, also for not removing banned content.

Interfax news agency reported that Amazon's fines concerned content about the distribution of drugs and information about how to commit suicide.

Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.

Twitch has been fined before, for hosting video interviews with Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that Moscow said contained ""fake"" information.

On Tuesday, the state news agency TASS reported that one of the two 4-million-rouble penalties for Twitch concerned the broadcast of a new interview with Arestovych, conducted by a Russian lawyer who has been designated a 'foreign agent'.

Twitch did not respond to a request for comment, but TASS quoted Twitch's lawyer as saying that the offending videos had been deleted by the time the cases were considered by the court.

Meta Platforms Inc. (META.O) was found guilty of carrying out ""extremist activities"" and its social networks Facebook and Instagram were banned, while Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google has been fined for a string of alleged offences and its Russian subsidiary has filed for bankruptcy.

Russia's communications regulator Roskomnadzor on Tuesday demanded that Google restore access to the YouTube account of the Federation Council, the upper house of parliament, Russian news agencies reported.

Summary

Summary Companies Any US export block may affect global chip supply -analysts

Move would hinder Samsung, SK Hynix upgrading China plants

Samsung, SK Hynix together supply over 50% of global NAND chips

Curbs could change where future chip plants are built -analyst















SEOUL, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Export restrictions being considered by Washington to halt China's advances in semiconductor manufacturing could come at a substantial cost, experts say, potentially disrupting fragile global chip supply chains - and hurting U.S. businesses.

Reuters reported on Monday that the United States is considering limiting shipments of American chipmaking equipment to memory chip producers in China that make advanced semiconductors used in everything from smartphones to data centres. read more

The curbs would stop chipmakers like South Korean giants Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and SK Hynix (000660.KS) from shipping new technology tools to factories they operate in China, preventing them from upgrading plants that serve customers around the world.

Samsung and SK Hynix, which control more than half of the global NAND flash memory chip market, have invested heavily in China in recent decades to produce chips that are vital to customers including tech giants Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Facebook owner Meta (META.O) and Google (GOOGL.O). As well as computers and phones, the chips are used in products like electric vehicles that require digital data storage.

""Samsung's China production alone accounts for more than 15% of global NAND flash production ... If there's any production disruption, it will make chip prices surge,"" said Lee Min-hee, analyst at BNK Securities.

The potential for fresh turmoil - the curbs have yet to be approved - comes just as a global chip supply shortage that has disrupted businesses from autos to consumer devices for more than a year is finally showing signs of easing. Supply chain adjustments and weakening consumer demand amid the slowing global economy have combined to repair damage. read more

But the shortage has yet to be fully resolved. Any signs of fresh disruption could rekindle supply uncertainty, triggering a price surge - as seen earlier this year when China imposed COVID-19 restrictions in Xian where Samsung manufactures chips. read more

Chipmaking equipment has to be installed and fully tested months before production is due to start. Any delay in shipping the gear to China would pose a real challenge to chipmakers as they seek to manufacture more advanced chips in China facilities.

""Many U.S. companies, like Apple, use Samsung and SK Hynix memory chips. No matter what strategy (the South Korean firms) end up choosing, it will have global implications,"" said BNK Securities analyst Lee.

Samsung and SK Hynix declined to comment. Apple, Amazon, Meta and Google didn't respond to emails seeking comment outside regular U.S. business hours.

AMBITIONS, COMPLICATIONS

In Samsung's memory chip operation in Xian, central China, one of the largest foreign chip projects in the country, the company has invested a total of about $26 billion since it broke ground on the site in 2012, including chip production as well as testing and packaging.

The tech giant makes 128-layer NAND flash products in Xian, analysts said, chips that store data in devices such as smartphones and personal computers, as well as in data centres.

The facility accounts for 43% of Samsung's global NAND flash memory production capacity and 15% of the overall global output capacity, according to TrendForce late last year. read more

The U.S. crackdown, if approved, could also complicate SK Hynix's ambition to expand its presence in the NAND market where it is ranked third as of first quarter behind Samsung and Japan's Kioxia Holdings, which was spun out of Toshiba Corp (6502.T).

SK Hynix completed late last year the first phase of its $9 billion purchase of Intel's (INTC.O) NAND business, including its Dalian, China NAND manufacturing facility. read more

CHINA STRATEGIES

The move being considered by the United States is one of several recent signs of deepening tensions between Beijing and Washington over the tech sector.

Congress last week approved legislation to subsidise semiconductor production in the United States. It bars any company that receives federal subsidies from investing in certain chip technology in China during the subsidy period. read more

The deepening tensions could leave Samsung and SK Hynix having to review strategies on China investments, analysts and industry sources said.

""Until now, companies tended to invest in countries like China, where costs were cheap,"" said Kim Yang-jae, analyst at Daol Investment & Securities.

""That's no longer going to be the only consideration. The biggest change these potential limits will bring will be where the next chip factories are built.""

They could also face potentially diminishing returns from their multi-billion dollar China plants, which could be stuck making older-technology, less lucrative chips.

SK Hynix has not been able to upgrade its DRAM memory chip production facilities in Wuxi, China with the latest extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) chipmaking machines made by Dutch firm ASML (ASML.AS) as U.S. officials do not want advanced equipment used in the process to enter the country. read more

The EUV machines are used to make more advanced and smaller chips that are used in high-end devices such as smartphones.

617,META,2022-09-16,"EU wants to ensure independent media, tougher media mergers rules","













BRUSSELS, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Media groups seeking to take over smaller rivals will have to make sure that their deals ensure media pluralism and safeguard editorial independence under draft rules announced by the European Commission on Friday.

The Media Freedom Act (MFA) is part of the European Union's strategy to prevent political interference in media outlets and spying on journalists and ensure transparent and non-discriminatory state advertising to media outlets.

The proposed rules come amid worries about media freedom in Hungary, Poland and Slovenia.

""Democracy will work only if journalists have the means and the necessary protection to keep in check those in power and those with power, be it political or economic actors,"" Commission Vice President Vera Jourova told a news conference.

The rules will apply to TV and radio broadcasters, on-demand audiovisual media services, press publications and very large online platforms and providers of video-sharing platforms.

The rules which set out safeguards against the use of spyware against media, journalists and their families, will need to be thrashed out with EU countries and lawmakers.

The Association of Commercial Television and Video on Demand Services in Europe (ACT), whose members include Sky, Canal+, ITV (ITV.L), NBCUniversal and Virgin Media Television, urged caution about putting in additional hurdles to media mergers.

""There is also a risk of impacting existing competition frameworks, thereby preventing legitimate consolidation in order to better compete with tech giants,"" it said.

Tech lobbying group CCIA Europe, whose members include Google (GOOGL.O), Meta (META.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N), criticised a provision forcing online platforms to accept on their platforms any organisation that declares itself a media outlet.

""This amounts to a must-carry obligation of content for online platforms, which rogue actors could exploit to disseminate abusive, extremist, or illegal content as well as disinformation, such as Russian propaganda, under the pretence of sharing news,"" it said.

618,META,2022-03-31,Explainer: Russia's internet crackdown,"













LONDON, March 31 (Reuters) - On the day Russian troops poured into Ukraine, Russia's state communications regulator Roskomnadzor put out a statement, demanding that media outlets only use official Russian sources to cover the ""special operation"" in Ukraine. Otherwise they could be blocked and face a fine of up to 5 million roubles.

Russian authorities, which did not comment for this article, have since doubled down on censorship in Russia. On March 4, lawmakers passed amendments that criminalised ""discrediting"" Russian armed forces or calling for sanctions against Russia.

Lawmakers made the spread of ""fake"" information an offence punishable with fines or a jail term of up to 15 years, a move that led some international news outlets to halt reporting in Russia.

Authorities also restricted access to Facebook and Twitter and blocked several independent media and Ukrainian websites.

In response, Twitter said people should have free and open access to the internet, particularly during times of crisis. Nick Clegg, president of global affairs for Facebook's parent company Meta, said millions of ordinary Russians would be cut off from reliable information.

Several Russian media outlets suspended their work. Ekho Moskvy, a liberal radio station, was dissolved by its board after the prosecutor general's office blocked its website over its coverage of the war. Television channel Rain suspended its work after its website was blocked. The Novaya Gazeta newspaper, whose editor Dmitry Muratov was a co-winner of last year's Nobel Peace Prize, said it would pause its work until the end of Russia's ""special operation"" in Ukraine.

Online censorship was already rising before the invasion. Ahead of the September elections last year, major internet outages were caused by a crackdown on websites linked to jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny and on technology used to circumvent online bans.

Around 200,000 websites were blocked in 2021, according to data from Roskomsvoboda, a group that monitors internet freedom in Russia. They included the website of OVD-Info, which has documented anti-Kremlin protests for years. This year, as of March 10, more than 46,000 sites have been blocked, according to Roskomsvoboda.

619,META,2022-06-02,India weighs panel to rule on appeals against social media takedowns,"Summary

Summary Companies Govt proposes panels with authority over social media

30-day timeline for grievance resolutions

Advocacy group terms move as 'problematic'

India among govts with most social takedown requests















NEW DELHI, June 2 (Reuters) - India is considering whether to set up an appeals panel with the power to reverse the content moderation decisions of social media firms, the information technology ministry said, in what would be the first such move of its kind worldwide.

The revelation came in a document seeking comments on plans for changes to IT rules that took effect last year, and aim to regulate social media content, making firms such as Facebook (FB.O), YouTube (GOOGL.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N) more accountable.

The document, made public on Thursday, proposed one or more such appeal panels. It set a deadline of 30 days for appeals against decisions by company grievance officers, while the panels themselves get a further 30 days to take up the matter.

Social media firms are already required to have an in-house grievance redressal officer and designate executives to co-ordinate with law enforcement officials.

""The intermediary shall respect the rights accorded to citizens under the constitution,"" the draft rules say in a newly-added section, referring to social media companies.

India ranks among the largest sources worldwide of government requests for content takedowns to Twitter Inc and Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O).

The ministry's plan stands to increase government control of social media platforms by allowing it to appoint officers to supervise content moderation decisions, said Apar Gupta, of the digital advocacy group the Internet Freedom Foundation.

""This is problematic, for this committee will lack any autonomy and is being formed without any statutory, or clear legal basis,"" added Gupta, the group's executive director.

Tension has flared between India's nationalist government and Twitter, which declined last year to comply fully with orders to take down accounts and posts accused of spreading misinformation about farmers' protests against the government.

Last year, government officials said social media platforms may no longer be eligible to seek liability exemptions as intermediaries or the hosts of user content if they failed to follow domestic information and technology laws.

NEW YORK, March 14 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Uber Technologies (UBER.N) and Lyft (LYFT.O) dodged a pothole, but bigger roadblocks may be on the horizon. A California court on Monday found in favor of letting the ride-sharing companies classify their drivers as independent contractors. That doesn’t eliminate risks from recent unionization drives and plentiful jobs elsewhere, though.

Keeping workers off permanent payroll will help tamp down potential costs. Jefferies estimates Uber, Lyft and food delivery service DoorDash (DASH.N) will avoid a $20 million to $170 million knock on next year’s earnings thanks to the ruling. Shares in all three companies were up around 6% in late-morning trading on Tuesday.

The enthusiastic reaction might be missing other incipient problems. Employees of companies from Starbucks (SBUX.O) to Apple (AAPL.O) are looking to organize as they push for better benefits. A group of Uber and Lyft drivers in New York City staged a strike in February over demands for higher wages. And with a tight job market, competition for workers from employers in other sectors – like retailers, which are hiking minimum wages – is stiff. The Biden administration could still step in, too, having proposed new guidelines for classifying independent workers as employees. There are yellow lights flashing ahead. (By Jennifer Saba)

LONDON, Feb 16 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Schneider Electric (SCHN.PA) sells products like circuit breakers that help customers manage their energy consumption in a sustainable way. Jean-Pascal Tricoire’s leadership of the French industrial software group reinforces the image of long-term reliability. On Thursday the $93 billion company said the chief executive was vacating the role after almost two decades at the helm. Peter Herweck, now the boss of Aveva, the British software group Schneider bought last month, will take over in May.

Tricoire’s term is uncommon: only 19% of CEOs stay in the job for more than 10 years while the median tenure is just five years, according to a PwC study. Tricoire has also avoided the faltering performance that often afflicts long-serving corporate chieftains. Over the last two decades Schneider’s revenue has quadrupled to 34 billion euros. Including dividends, shareholders have earned more than 10 times their money. That’s a better return than European rival Siemens (SIEGn.DE), though less than ABB (ABBN.S).

The only snag is that Tricoire is not leaving entirely: he’s staying on as Schneider’s chairman until at least 2025. Investors will hope this governance blooper doesn’t upset the company’s sustainable returns. (By Karen Kwok)

623,META,2023-03-16,Stripe’s $50 bln reset is relative sign of health,"













LONDON, March 16 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Stripe’s valuation cut is arguably still a relative sign of strength. The privately held payment startup co-founded by brothers Patrick and John Collison said late on Wednesday it raised over $6.5 billion from existing and new investors in a funding round that values it at $50 billion. The newly attained price tag is a 47% cut from its 2021 valuation of $95 billion. And by some metrics Stripe seems to be valued at a discount relative to its publicly listed peers. Stripe’s $50 billion is 3.5 times last year’s gross revenue, while Dutch payment firm Adyen (ADYEN.AS) trades on a multiple of 4.7 times.

The valuation cut reflects the reality of how an economic slowdown affects fintech businesses like Stripe. But it’s somewhat less than the 85% hit to Swedish fintech peer Klarna’s valuation last May. And raising $6.5 billion following a funding crunch and the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank arguably shows the strength of the business. It’s the largest private fundraising for a U.S. company ever. None of the public market listings so far this year managed to raise as much: top of that list is American Water Works (AWK.N), which raised just $1.7 billion through a public listing, according to Dealogic.

Stripe also didn’t dilute existing shareholders, like Andreessen Horowitz and Thrive Capital, and managed to add new ones such as Singapore’s Temasek and GIC. None of the money, meanwhile, is intended for Stripe’s corporate coffers: a big chunk is just to pay a tax bill for its employees. Rival tech companies’ main sentiment may well be envy.

Allbirds (BIRD.O), the seller of utilitarian sneakers made from sustainably sourced materials, lowered its sales forecast and widened its loss expectation on Monday, sending shares crashing. Like Meta Platforms (META.O) and Snap (SNAP.N), it is also cutting jobs. And at a mere $632 million, the company’s prospects as a stand-alone company look to be walking out the door.

Shares are now about a third of their price from last November when it completed its initial public offering. If the company inks its sales forecast of $315 million this year, its value, net of cash, will be worth 1.3 times revenue. That’s less than half the valuation of established sneaker company Nike (NKE.N) and about a quarter the multiple of Roger Federer-backed firm On (ONON.N).

If Silicon Valley decides style and virtue-signaling are less valuable when working from Idaho, Allbirds will continue to struggle. But at some point, the company could be an attractive target for a firm looking to back into a public listing, say, like athletic sneaker company No Bull, or one like Nike, just hoping to spruce things up with a cheap pair of kicks.

625,META,2022-11-29,AMC Networks CEO exits after brief stint; plans 20% U.S. job cuts,"













Nov 29 (Reuters) - (This Nov. 29 story has been refiled to remove picture)

AMC Networks (AMCX.O) said its chief executive officer had stepped down, less than three months after taking over the role, and that it would cut about 20% of its U.S. workforce as it faces industry pressures and a challenging economy.

Shares of the cable TV network, home to hit shows such as ""Mad Men"" and ""The Walking Dead"", fell 4.4% on Tuesday.

Christina Spade, who served as CEO since September, will receive severance benefits in accordance with the terms of her employment agreement, on ""a termination without 'cause' or resignation for 'good reason' basis,"" the company said in a regulatory filing.

AMC Networks declined to comment further on the departure. It said the board was in the process of finding a successor.

""We thank Christina for her contributions to the company in her CEO role and her earlier CFO (chief financial officer) role, and we wish her well in her future endeavors,"" Chairman James Dolan said in a brief statement.

The layoffs at AMC Networks come at a time when several companies including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Facebook-parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) are making deep cuts to their employee base to navigate a potential downturn in the economy.

AMC Networks had 1,739 full-time and 287 part-time employees as of Dec. 31, according to a regulatory filing.

Cord cutting and a gloomy advertising market have weighed on the company's business, with shares down 40% year to date.

The streaming unit has, however, emerged as a bright spot. Revenue in the division surged 41% in the last reported quarter, even as the company's overall revenue slumped 16%.

Spade joined as CFO in 2021 after serving as the finance chief of ViacomCBS, now Paramount Global (PARA.O).

In September, she took the helm from Matt Blank who had held it on an interim basis after long-time Chief Executive Officer Josh Sapan stepped down in August last year.

626,META,2022-09-11,Disney CEO lays out early plan for digital future,"













Sept 11 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) on Sunday sketched the contours of a plan for how the entertainment, theme parks and consumer products conglomerate will use technology to enhance storytelling for the next 100 years.

Speaking backstage at the company's biennial D23 Expo fan convention with Reuters, Chief Executive Bob Chapek took great pains to avoid what he called the ""M-word,"" or metaverse, despite pushing the company in that direction last year.

Chapek described Disney's vision for the metaverse as ""next-generation storytelling."" He wants to use data gleaned from theme park visits and consumers' streaming habits to deliver personalized entertainment experiences, including from the company's Marvel and Lucasfilm studios.

""Disney is absolutely a lifestyle,"" he told Reuters on Sunday in an interview at the convention in Anaheim, Calif. ""The question is, how is our next-gen storytelling leveraging what we know about a guest uniquely in this Disney lifestyle, then serving up unique experiences.""

Entertainment and technology companies rushed to secure a position in the metaverse after Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the future of his company would be devoted to creating a robust, three-dimensional, persisitent environment where users’ digital avatars would work, hang out and pursue their hobbies.

Well ahead of Meta's announcement, Chapek, who oversaw the parks division before taking over the top job in 2020, has spent years preparing how to extend the theme park experience to people who will never visit one of the company's six theme parks globally.

Disney started laying the groundwork in earnest to explore new forms of storytelling over the past year, as it appointed veteran media and tech executive, Mike White, to oversee the newly created Next Generation Storytelling and Consumer Experiences unit.

White has been charged with assembling the technological toolkit for Disney's creative executives to employ.

He has also been brainstorming ideas for using augmented reality and other technologies to bring a new dimension to storytelling. Chapek cited one early example - an eight-minute augmented reality film that premiered this week on Disney+.

""This could be a real big catalyst for what's going to show up there and, you know, five to 10 years,"" said Chapek.

627,META,2022-09-26,"Exclusive: With eye on Big Tech, energy crisis, EU telcos call for shared network costs","













BRUSSELS, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), Orange (ORAN.PA), Telefonica (TEF.MC) and 13 other European telecoms providers on Monday made their strongest push for Big Tech to share network costs, citing the energy crisis and EU climate change goals.

The call comes as the European Commission prepares to seek feedback from both sides before making a legislative proposal that could force tech companies to help pay for the roll-out of 5G and fibre cables across the 27-country European Union. read more

The sector which invests some 50 billion euros ($48.5 billion) annually in infrastructure, needs more funding and urgently, the chief executives of the companies said in a statement.

""Costs of planning and construction works are increasing. Prices for fibre optic cables, for example, have almost doubled in the first semester 2022. Similarly, the hikes in energy prices and in the prices of other inputs are also hitting the connectivity sector,"" they said.

""Timely action is a must: Europe missed out on many of the opportunities offered by the consumer internet. It must now swiftly build strength for the age of the metaverses,"" the CEO's said.

""For this to happen, and to be sustainable over time, we believe that the largest traffic generators should make a fair contribution to the sizeable costs they currently impose on European networks,"" they said.

Other signatories to the statement include Vodafone (VOD.L), Bouygues Telecom (BOUY.PA), KPN (KPN.AS), BT Group (BT.L), TIM Group, Telia Company (TELIA.ST), Fastweb (SCMNSF.UL) and Altice Portugal.

Europe's telecoms operators argue that U.S. tech firms such as Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O), Meta (META.O) and Netflix (NFLX.O) account for more than half of internet traffic and should bear some of the cost of upgrading infrastructure.

Big Tech has rebuffed such requests, saying they are already investing in equipment and technologies to deliver content more efficiently.

628,META,2022-08-30,Smaller EU telcos say network fee aimed at Big Tech will hurt competition,"













BRUSSELS, Aug 30 (Reuters) - EU regulators' plan to make Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google, Meta and Netflix (NFLX.O) bear some of the costs of the bloc's telecoms network would distort the telecoms market and harm competition, a group of small telecoms operators said on Tuesday.

The warning from MVNO Europe, whose members include Comcast's (CMCSA.O) pay TV company Sky which has its own mobile service, German mobile operator Freenet (FNTGn.DE) and Poste Italiane unit PosteMobile, underlined the stakes involved.

Big players such as Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), Orange (ORAN.PA) and Telefonica (TEF.MC) have long complained about tech rivals free-riding on their networks.

Their lobbying paid off when the European Commission earlier this year said it would propose legislation by year-end that would force tech rivals to partly fund network costs.

Such moves could cause more harm than good, MVNO Europe said on its website.

""We fear that the suggested network investment contributions would seriously harm competition on telecom markets, harm MVNOs directly, and ultimately be detrimental to both consumers and business users,"" it said.

MVNOs (mobile virtual network operators) do not own network infrastructure but piggyback on bigger rivals to provide their services to their customers.

""Materialization of the suggestions in legislation could lead to disruption of current peering and transit markets which are currently functioning competitively on the basis of well-established commercial practices,"" the group said.

""This proposal could bring to the unwished result that largest telecom providers will have their network services paid not only twice (by customers and by content and application providers), but even three times (that is also by alternative operators, which however are already paying network access fees),"" it said.

Digital rights activists have also warned of the risk to Europe's net neutrality rules that support an open internet. read more

629,META,2022-11-07,Ireland touts strong investment pipeline amid tech job cuts,"













DUBLIN, Nov 7 (Reuters) - (This Nov. 7 story has been corrected to say ""106,000"" not ""37,000"" in paragraph 6, after a state agency clarification)

Ireland has a strong pipeline of investments from foreign-owned multinationals and expects many positive announcements in the coming months, Deputy Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Monday, looking to ease fears around tech-sector jobs cuts.

Ireland is hugely reliant on multinationals that employ over 275,000 people, or one in nine workers, and pay a large chunk of the country's income and corporate taxes. Jobs growth in the sector soared to record levels in the first half of 2022.

However, digital payments firm Stripe and Twitter, both of whom employ around 500 in Ireland, announced layoffs last week and the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) plans to begin large-scale layoffs this week.

Meta's international headquarters are in Ireland, where it is one of the largest multinationals, directly employing around 3,000 staff with another 6,000 supporting its operations across the country.

It is also set to move into a large new campus in Dublin shortly.

Varadkar was briefed on Monday by the state's inwards investment agency, IDA Ireland, on the current situation in the global tech sector. Tech multinationals employ over 106,000 people in Ireland, according to the IDA.

""There is a strong pipeline of new investments from overseas and within Ireland in a range of sectors including tech and in other sectors and we expect many positive announcements in the coming months,"" Varadkar, who is also the country's enterprise minister, said in a statement.

""As a country we are close to full employment, with high demand for tech, marketing and other skills across all sectors.""

Multinational job announcements have continued in the second half of the year with cloud data service provider NetApp Inc (NTAP.O) saying on Friday that it would create 500 jobs by 2025 at its new international headquarters in the city of Cork.

Multinational firms have been responsible for an enormous boom in corporate tax receipts in recent years, and also now account for around 33% of all income tax paid in the country due to their highly paid roles.

630,META,2022-12-02,Irish domestic economy shrank in Q3 following Q2 investment boom,"Summary

Summary Companies Consumer spending grows modestly in spite of rising prices

Minister says figures in line with 2022 projections

ICT sector fails to deliver usual Q3 bounce amid job cuts















DUBLIN, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Ireland's domestic economy shrank by 1.1% quarter-on-quarter from July to September, following the strong investment driven growth of 4.7% in the second quarter of the year, data from the Central Statistics Office showed on Friday.

Modified domestic demand (MDD), which strips out some of the ways Ireland's large multinationals distort economic activity, was still up 10.1% for the first nine months of 2022 and the CSO said the quarterly decline was mainly due to the strong second quarter base.

Ireland's finance ministry's current forecast is for growth of 7.7% for 2022 as a whole and finance minister Paschal Donohoe said Friday's data was very much in line with his department's projections.

""With inflation eroding real incomes of households and undermining the profitability of SMEs, I would expect the pace of growth in the domestic economy to remain soft throughout the final months of this year and into the first half of next year,"" Donohoe said in a statement.

The finance ministry slashed its forecast for 2023 Modified domestic demand to 1.2% in September.

Most recent economic data have pointed to a softening of activity in the second half of the year and the finance ministry had expected rising inflation to tip consumer spending into negative territory in the third and fourth quarters.

Friday's data showed that personal spending managed to eke out quarterly growth of 0.3%. That was well down on the 2.2% in the second quarter but higher inflation meant consumers had to spend a lot more in order to get slightly more goods and services.

Gross domestic product (GDP), a broader measure of economic activity, grew by 2.3% on the quarter and was 10.9% higher year-on-year. The government has long cautioned against using this measure as it is routinely inflated by multinational activity.

The data also showed that the information and communications technology (ICT) sector did not register its usual third quarter bounce and was down 7.4% quarter-on-quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis.

Multinational jobs growth soared to record levels in Ireland the first half of this year, but since then a number of tech firms including Facebook parent Meta (META.O), Twitter and Stripe have laid off Irish staff as part of global cutbacks.

631,META,2022-08-02,"Australian AI star Appen flags first-half loss, shares plunge","













Aug 2 (Reuters) - Australia's Appen Ltd (APX.AX), which runs artificial intelligence training for Facebook, Google and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), said a spending slowdown by clients would bring its first half-year loss since listing, sending its shares tumbling.

The warning on Tuesday shows how hefty spending cuts by global tech giants, facing raging inflation and rising interest rates, are filtering into the Australian share market where Appen has been an analyst favourite due to its high-profile customer base. read more

Adding to Appen's challenges, new privacy features in Apple Inc products have reduced the ability of big advertisers including Facebook, which is owned by Meta Platforms Inc , and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google to target users, impacting their appetite for pinpoint-accurate user data, say analysts.

Appen's business model involves outsourcing hundreds of data-checking projects to contractors who manually check and label online content, which clients then feed into their algorithms.

After warning of a profit decline in May, Appen said it now expects a net loss of $3.8 million in the six months ended June, which would be its first interim loss since listing in 2015, from a net profit of $12.5 million a year earlier.

""Conditions have changed through the year,"" Chief Executive Officer Mark Brayan said on an analyst call.

""We believe this is a slowdown, rather than a competitive situation,"" he added, when asked if the company had lost business to rivals like Canada's Telus International (TIXT.TO), which along with Appen dominates the global market for so-called artificial intelligence training.

Shares of Appen fell as much as 29% by midsession, against a half percentage point decline on the broader market (.AXJO).

""Visibility of earnings has historically been low and in this environment of weakening global ad spend... it seems likely that visibility has taken a step down,"" Jefferies analyst John Campbell wrote in a research note.

RBC Capital Markets analyst Garry Sherriff said cooling investor sentiment was ""likely to continue ... given multiple material downgrades and questions on revenue visibility and strategy"".

632,META,2022-03-28,"Deal on rules forcing tech giants to police content possible in April, EU's Vestager says","













BRUSSELS, March 28 (Reuters) - A deal between EU countries and EU lawmakers that would require tech giants to do more to police content on their platforms could be agreed next month, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Monday.

Vestager proposed the Digital Services Act, (DSA) which forces tech giants to do more to tackle illegal content or risk fines up to 6% of their global turnover, just over a year ago.

EU countries and EU lawmakers are now thrashing out the details, with debate over the definition of an online marketplace subject to the rules and the criteria for banning targeted advertisements.

""There is a very strong momentum to get things done. And the leadership of the French presidency may allow us to finalise the Digital Services Act before the end of April. But if we work hard, and we're lucky, it may be possible,"" Vestager told Reuters in an interview.

Vestager last week secured the green light from EU countries and EU lawmakers for her other landmark proposal, called the Digital Markets Act (DMA), targeting Google (GOOGL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Meta (FB.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O). read more

The DMA sets out a list of dos and don'ts and gives companies designated as online gatekeepers, which control access and data on their platforms, six months to comply with the rules. Businesses, however, say that is too short for such complex legislation.

Vestager said there would be no extension as companies are aware of what constitutes anti-competitive practices.

""Well, actually both I think we in our work and the companies should be very happy that we have six months because it was one of the things that were intensively discussed during the negotiations,"" she said.

""And since both the prohibitions and the obligations are things that come from established case law, I don't think any of them are sort of big surprises.""

Asked whether the DMA would cover non-U.S. tech giants, Vestager said: ""It's likely but I don't know.""

Observers said booking.com and Alibaba (9988.HK) may fall under the new rules.

BRUSSELS, Jan 10 (Reuters) - The European Commission wants to ask Big Tech and European Union telecoms providers about their investment outlays and cloud infrastructure plans before tabling legislation that could make the former pay for network costs, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), Orange (ORAN.PA), Telefonica (TEF.MC), Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) and the big operators say such a move is all about a fair share contribution as the six largest content providers account for just over half of data internet traffic.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Meta (META.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and other tech giants say the idea amounts to an internet traffic tax that could undermine Europe's net neutrality rules treating all users equally.

The Commission plans to launch a public consultation with a lengthy questionnaire next week, although the timing may still change, the person said. It will likely last about 12 weeks before the Commission drafts legislation that EU countries and EU lawmakers will need to thrash out before it can become law.

The Commission will ask Big Tech and telecoms what they are investing in, how this will evolve and whether there is an investment gap, the person said.

They will be asked on their views on a shift into cloud infrastructure and the investments needed for this as regulators want the debate to go beyond spending on cables and tower.

Regulators also want to know about the relationship between Big Tech and telecoms providers.

The Commission will ask consultation participants about the regulatory responses in other parts of the world on network fees, such as in South Korea and Australia, and the lessons learned from these.

634,META,2023-02-13,"Palantir expects 2023 to be first profitable year, shares soar","













Feb 13 (Reuters) - Palantir Technologies (PLTR.N) on Monday forecast its first profitable year and said it had slowed hiring, cut stock-based payouts and reduced cloud computing investments in response to lower spending from recession-wary businesses.

The forecast, coming on the back of better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, sent the data analytics software maker's shares up 16% after hours and was set to add nearly $3 billion to the company's market capitalization of $15.6 billion.

""As we look ahead to 2023, we will continue to exercise spend discipline ... pace hiring while continuing to invest in high priority areas, including in our product offerings, building out our go-to-market strategy and technical roles,"" said finance chief David Glazer.

The comments on cost discipline echo those from tech giants including Meta Platforms (META.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), which have shed thousands of jobs in the past months.

Palantir executives also enthused over AI on an interview, saying the rise of ChatGPT was proving to be a bright spot for the sector and would help its business in 2023.

""There are many different ways we can integrate with technologies like ChatGPT and apply those technologies to our customers data,"" Chief Revenue Officer Ryan Taylor told Reuters. He did not elaborate on how Palantir would do that.

Still, Palantir's stock was up too much considering fourth-quarter profitability was driven by ""below the line"" adjustments like interest income and the quarter itself was in-line with expectations, RBC analyst Rishi Jaluria said.

The company forecast 2023 revenue between $2.18 billion and $2.23 billion, below the $2.29 billion estimated by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Revenue from newly public firms that use Palantir's services has taken a hit as economic uncertainty torpedoes the market for U.S. stock listings. That revenue is expected to nearly halve in the first quarter to $16 million from a year earlier.

Still, a jump in defense contracts following Russia's invasion of Ukraine helped fourth-quarter revenue beat estimates with a rise of 18% to $509 million. Palantir signed deals with defense contractor Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) and the UK military in the period.

Excluding items, Palantir earned 4 cents per share, compared to estimates of 3 cents per share.

July 28 (Reuters) - Roku Inc (ROKU.O) posted a wider-than-expected quarterly loss on Thursday and withdrew its revenue growth rate estimate for the year as the current economic turmoil squeezes its ad business, sending the streaming platform's shares down 26%.

While inflationary pressures and fears of a recession have forced advertisers to make cuts to their marketing budgets this year, increasing competition has also added to the headaches of companies selling online ads.

California-based Roku, which issued a downbeat revenue forecast for the current quarter, was also hit by consumers tightening their spending amid soaring food and fuel prices.

""We are facing an increasingly difficult and uncertain environment. Recessionary fears, inflationary pressures, rising interest rates and ongoing supply chain issues will continue to impact both consumers and advertisers,"" Chief Financial Officer Steve Louden told analysts on a call.

Roku's dismal forecast mirrors updates from major tech firms including Snapchat-parent Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), which have warned of a slowdown in the ad market over the next few quarters. read more

Facebook-parent Meta Platforms (META.O) also took a hit from slowing ad sales, forcing it to issue a grim forecast and record its first ever quarterly drop in revenue on Wednesday. read more

In contrast to Roku, the world's largest streaming service, Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), said last week it was expecting to return to customer growth in the third quarter and that it planned to launch its ad-supported option next year. read more

Roku's total net revenue rose more than 18% to $764.4 million for the second quarter ended June 30, but failed to match analysts' estimates of $805.2 million, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

It also reported a loss of 82 cents per share, wider than the 69-cent per-share loss that analysts had expected.

The company projected current-quarter revenue to grow 3% to $700 million, lower than the $901.7 million estimated by analysts.

636,META,2022-05-10,Russia's RuTube knocked out for second day by Victory Day cyber attack,"













LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - RuTube, Russia's answer to YouTube, was crippled for a second day on Tuesday by a cyber attack whose timing it linked to this week's anniversary celebrations of victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two.

Usually packed with video content, RuTube's site is currently black, with a short message reading: ""Attention! The site is undergoing technical work. The site was attacked. At the moment the situation is under control. User data has been saved.""

The attack began on Monday, a major national holiday when Russia commemorated the Soviet victory over Adolf Hitler and President Vladimir Putin delivered a speech likening that struggle to the current war in Ukraine.

""Someone really wanted to prevent RuTube from showing the Victory Day parade and celebratory fireworks,"" RuTube said. ""It is not a sin to remember the battles our guys won. The battle for RuTube continues.""

It described the cyber attack as the worst in the site's history.

In a separate incident on Monday, Russian satellite television menus were hacked to show viewers in Moscow messages about events in Ukraine, including ""You have blood on your hands"", according to screenshots obtained by Reuters. read more

The websites of state-owned companies and news websites have fallen under sporadic hacking efforts since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, often to show information that is at odds with Moscow's official line on what it calls a ""special military operation"".

RuTube said a large team was working to restore the service, and denied reports it had lost the website's source code.

The long outage goes some way to explaining why Russia has not yet blocked Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) YouTube, despite repeatedly fining and warning the U.S. service over its removal of some state-backed Russian channels and for failing to delete content Moscow deems illegal.

Russia restricted access to Twitter (TWTR.N) and Meta Platform's (FB.O) Facebook and Instagram in early March. read more

Critics have previously told Reuters that RuTube, despite its weekly user numbers jumping in early March as other foreign social media were forced out of the Russian market, still has a long way to go to rival Google's video product. read more

ZURICH, June 29 (Reuters) - Siemens (SIEGn.DE) has signed a partnership agreement with chip designer Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) to create an industrial metaverse - an enhanced virtual reality for companies to reduce the costs of running their factories, buildings and speed up new product design.

The deal is a cornerstone of Siemens Xcelerator, a new open digital platform also launched by the German technology and engineering company on Wednesday.

The cloud-based platform, which will feature hardware, software and digital services, is part of Siemens' ambition to grow its digital business by 10% per year from the 5.6 billion euros ($5.89 billion) generated in 2021.

""Siemens Xcelerator will make it easier than ever before for companies to navigate digital transformation – faster and at scale,"" Siemens Chief Executive Roland Busch said in a statement.

Siemens, which bought Brightly Software for $1.58 billion on Monday, is moving further into the digital space because it offers faster growth rates and higher margins than its traditional business of trains and industrial drives and automation. read more

Siemens and Nvidia are just two of the companies which are working in the so-called metaverse, which refers broadly to the idea of a shared virtual platform that people can access through different devices and where they can move through digital environments.

Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (META.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) and others are also looking at metaverse technology can be used in business and leisure.

Siemens's Xcelerator will be the umbrella term for services which will allow customers to visualise yachts or factories, for example, before construction starts.

""We can essentially replace having to build a thing in the real world first,"" Tony Hemmelgarn, CEO of Siemens Digital Industries Software, told reporters.

The platform would also ensure products ""are going to work well, before we commit to building them in the real world when it becomes really expensive and difficult to change,"" he added.

The services will be offered to customers through Siemens's software as a service (SaaS) subscription model, to make it more affordable for small and medium sized companies.

As part of the collaboration, Siemens will connect Xcelerator and its own software and digital twin products with Nvidia's Omniverse, a platform for 3D design.

638,META,2022-12-19,Taiwan investigates TikTok for suspected illegal operations,"













TAIPEI, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Taiwan's government has opened a probe into Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok on suspicion of illegally operating a subsidiary on the island, though the company's owner denied the accusation.

TikTok, which is not widely used in Taiwan, has come under pressure mostly in the United States on concerns about China getting access to users' personal data, which the company denies.

In a statement late on Sunday, Taiwan's China-policy making Mainland Affairs Council said that on Dec. 9 a working group under the Cabinet had discovered that TikTok was suspected of ""illegal commercial operations"" in Taiwan.

Taiwan's Liberty Times newspaper reported that TikTok's owner, ByteDance, had set up a subsidiary on the island to tout for business, contravening Taiwanese law that Chinese social media platforms are not allowed commercial operations on the island.

The Mainland Affairs Council, responding to that report, said the Cabinet's working group had discovered that there was indeed a suspected breach of the law, and legal authorities were investigating.

""In recent years, the mainland side has used short video platforms like TikTok to carry out cognitive operations and infiltration against other countries, and there is a high risk the Chinese government is collecting users' personal information,"" it added.

However, ByteDance said ""recent reports"" suggesting it has set up a subsidiary in Taiwan were incorrect.

""The company has not established any legal entities in Taiwan,"" it said in an emailed statement to Reuters, without elaborating.

Taiwan prohibits a wide range of Chinese business operations on the island from social media platforms to its highly valued chip manufacturing industry.

Taiwan has already banned government departments from using Chinese apps such as TikTok, the council said.

Facebook and Instagram, both owned by Meta Platforms (META.O), are the most widely used social media platforms in Taiwan. TikTok trailed its peers in Taiwan but is becoming increasingly popular among the youth, according to market research companies.

Taiwan has long complained that China uses social media to spread disinformation on the island that Beijing claims as its own territory.

In 2019, Taiwan passed an anti-infiltration law, part of a years-long effort to combat what many in Taiwan see as Chinese efforts to influence politics and the democratic process, through illicit funding of politicians and the media and other methods.

639,META,2022-09-08,White House unveils principles for Big Tech reform,"













WASHINGTON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The White House on Thursday outlined six principles to reform Big Tech platforms and said it was encouraged to see bipartisan interest in Congress to rein in major U.S. tech companies.

The six principles, entitled ""Enhancing Competition and Tech Platform Accountability,"" were released after Biden administration officials earlier in the day met with experts to discuss ""the harms that tech platforms cause and the need for greater accountability.""

The White House said the United States needs ""clear rules of the road to ensure small and mid-size businesses and entrepreneurs can compete on a level playing field.""

""These principles are the culmination of months of work by the administration and engagement with numerous stakeholders,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. ""We're looking forward to hearing any feedback from the tech companies.""

A group of bipartisan lawmakers has introduced antitrust legislation aimed at reining in the four tech giants -- Meta Platform's (META.O) Facebook, Apple (AAPL.O), Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) -- that would bar the companies from favoring their own businesses in search results and other ways. The lawmakers have said they believe they have the 60 Senate votes needed to move forward, but no vote has yet been scheduled.

Among issues discussed at Thursday's meeting, which included numerous senior White House officials, District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine and technology experts, were antitrust, privacy, algorithmic discrimination and other tech policy areas, the White House said.

The six principles include promoting technology sector competition; adopting robust federal privacy protections, and tougher privacy and online protections for children; rescinding special legal protections for large tech platforms; increasing transparency about platforms' algorithms and content moderation decisions; and ending discriminatory algorithmic decision-making.

""The rise of tech platforms has introduced new and difficult challenges,"" the White House said, ""from the tragic acts of violence linked to toxic online cultures, to deteriorating mental health and wellbeing, to basic rights of Americans and communities worldwide suffering from the rise of tech platforms big and small.""

640,META,2023-02-16,Buffett’s TSMC U-turn spotlights chips’ siren call,"













HONG KONG, Feb 16 (Reuters Breakingviews) - A lot can change in three months, especially in the world of semiconductor investing. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) inexplicably sold most of its $4.1 billion holding in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (2330.TW), a position only disclosed in November.

The sudden U-turn is uncharacteristic for the world's most-watched investor, whose bets on companies like Chinese electric-car maker BYD (002594.SZ), (1211.HK) have paid off handsomely after over a decade. For TSMC, Berkshire probably pocketed a 9% return, Reuters reported citing analyst estimates, having held the stake for roughly three months. Further perplexing investors, Buffett's business partner Charlie Munger declared that TSMC was the ""strongest company on earth"" at a meeting on Wednesday.

He may be right about TSMC, which boasts a monopoly in advanced chipmaking and superior profitability - the ""moats"" Buffett prizes so highly. Yet the backdrop has darkened. In January, TSMC warned revenue will fall in the first quarter; peers including Micron Technology (MU.O) and Intel (INTC.O) have announced spending cuts and layoffs too.

Geopolitics have also dampened the sector’s appeal. Washington is enlisting allies to restrict chip exports to China. The shooting down of a suspected Chinese spy balloon in the United States this month has escalated tensions. Recent comments by American defense and intelligence officials warning that Beijing might invade Taiwan in the next few years don’t help either. Moat or no moat, the outlook for chips is getting dicey. (By Robyn Mak)

HONG KONG, Sept 21 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Candour is often welcome during times of distress. Forrest Li, the chief executive of Singapore's Sea (SE.N), is not mincing his words as he sounds the alarm at his $26 billion e-commerce to video-games outfit. In a Sept. 15 internal memo seen by Breakingviews, he candidly admits that Sea will not be able to raise external funds and lays out a plan to achieve ""self-sufficiency"", or positive operating cash flow, within 12 to 18 months. Companies from Meta (META.O) to Alibaba (9988.HK) are emphasising financial discipline amid a slowing global economy.

Sea's message is eye-catching, nonetheless. In March, Li had defended the company's strategy to spend on growth rather than focus on profitability to placate shareholders, according to Bloomberg. The shift in tone follows reports read more of massive job cuts, a retreat from Latin America as well as a 150% jump in second-quarter operating loss, to $837 million, from a year earlier. Since the start of the year, Sea's New York stock has plunged nearly 75%.

OTTAWA, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Facebook warned on Friday that it may block sharing of news content on its platform in Canada over concerns about legislation that would compel digital platforms to pay news publishers.

The Online News Act, introduced in April, laid out rules to force platforms like Meta's (META.O) Facebook and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google to negotiate commercial deals and pay news publishers for their content, in a move similar to a ground-breaking law passed in Australia last year. read more

The legislation is under consideration at a parliamentary committee, to which the U.S. social media company said it has not been invited to share its concerns.

""We believe the Online News Act misrepresents the relationship between platforms and news publishers, and we call on the government to review its approach,"" Marc Dinsdale, head of media partnerships at Meta Canada, said in a blog post.

""In the face of adverse legislation based on false assumptions that defy the logic of how Facebook operates, we believe it's important to be transparent about the possibility that we may be forced to reconsider allowing news content sharing in Canada,"" Dinsdale wrote.

Canada's Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez, who introduced the bill, said in a statement on Friday that the government continued to have ""constructive conversations"" with Facebook.

""All we're asking the tech giants like Facebook to do is negotiate fair deals with news outlets when they profit from their work,"" Rodriguez said in an emailed statement.

The legislation proposes that digital platforms that have a ""bargaining imbalance"" with news businesses - measured by metrics like a firm's global revenue - must make fair deals that would then be assessed by a regulator.

Dinsdale said news content was not a draw for Facebook users and did not bring significant revenue to the company.

When Australia, which has led global efforts to rein in the powers of tech firms, proposed legislation forcing them to pay local media for news content, Google threatened to close its Australian search engine, while Facebook cut all third-party content from Australian accounts for more than a week. read more

Both eventually struck deals with Australian media companies after a series of amendments to the legislation were offered.

643,META,2022-04-28,Morning Bid: The weak currency gang,"













A look at the day ahead in markets from Dhara Ranasinghe.

The weak-currency gang is growing in force.

The yen plunged to a new two-decade low versus the dollar on Thursday after the Bank of Japan doubled down on its super-low yield policy. The euro, down 5% already this month, is at five-year lows to the greenback, while China's yuan has also slid 4.6% in April, falling another 0.8% on Thursday read more

Given the scale and speed of such currency moves, it's worth watching out for what policymakers say or do, especially in the euro zone where inflation is running already at record highs.

All these currencies -- and many across emerging markets --- are being crushed under the wheels of a runaway dollar, which has powered to five-year highs against a basket of peers , lifted by expectations of big U.S. interest rate hikes.

But another driver, arguably, for the yuan and euro is the speed at which the global growth outlook is deteriorating. So the data-packed day ahead may offer clues on this subject.

An advance reading of first quarter U.S. economic growth is expected to show an annualized 1.1% growth, down sharply from 6.9% in the 2021 fourth quarter. read more

That would be the slowest since the recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Preliminary inflation numbers out of Germany could show whether price pressures are starting to abate in Europe's main powerhouse economy.

Expectations that the European Central Bank will hike interest rates sooner rather than later have provided no solace to the euro, battered by concerns that the currency bloc is headed for a sharp slowdown.

Stock markets meanwhile are not doing too badly, thanks to upbeat tech earnings. Facebook owner Meta (FB.O) beat Wall Street profit forecasts -- its Frankfurt-listed shares are up almost 19% after an after-market surge. read more

644,META,2022-08-17,Australia's top court finds Google not liable for defamation,"[1/2] The logo of Google is seen at the high profile startups and high tech leaders gathering, Viva Tech,in Paris, France May 16, 2019. REUTERS/Charles Platiau















SYDNEY, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Australia's highest court overturned on Wednesday a ruling that had found Google engaged in defamation by supplying a link to a contested newspaper article, throwing the spotlight again on how online libel cases are handled in the country.

The seven-judge panel of the High Court of Australia voted 5-2 to throw out an earlier finding that the Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) unit played a part in publishing the disputed article by acting as a ""library"" housing it, saying the website had no active role.

The decision brings fresh confusion to a question that has been simmering in Australia for years about where liability rests for online defamation. A years-long review of the country's libel law is yet to give a final recommendation on whether large platforms like Google and Meta Platforms' Facebook should be accountable.

The case stems from a 2004 article which suggested that a criminal defence lawyer had crossed professional lines and become a ""confidant"" of criminals, according to the published judgment. The lawyer, George Defteros, found a link to the story in a 2016 Google search of his name and had Google remove it after it was viewed by 150 people, the judgment said.

Defteros sued in a state court which found Google was a publisher and ordered it to pay him A$40,000 ($28,056). Google appealed the judgment, culminating in Wednesday's decision.

""The Underworld article was not written by any employee or agent of the appellant,"" two of the panel judges wrote in Wednesday's ruling, the appellant being Google.

""It was written by a reporter with no connection to the appellant, and published by an independent newspaper over which the appellant had no control or influence.""

Google ""does not own or control the internet"", they wrote.

A Google spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.

Defteros said in a statement that the process had been ""long, drawn out, expensive and extremely stressful"" but he felt vindicated because the court agreed the article was defamatory even though Google was not liable.

The ruling comes after the High Court last year found a newspaper publisher liable for defamatory comments left beneath an article that it had posted on Facebook. read more

The difference between the 2021 Facebook case and Wednesday's case was that the media companies last year ""invited and encouraged comment"", while Google ""did not provide a forum or place where it could be communicated, nor did it encourage the writing of comment in response"", the judges wrote.

645,META,2022-09-21,Florida asks U.S. Supreme Court to revive law targeting social media 'censorship',"













Sept 21 (Reuters) - Florida on Wednesday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to revive a state law aimed at stopping social media companies from restricting users' political speech after a federal appeals court blocked it earlier this year.

The law, which had been challenged by industry group NetChoice, would require social media companies to disclose the rules they use for banning or censoring users and to apply them consistently, and would limit their ability to ban candidates for political office from their platforms.

NetChoice's members include Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N).

The ruling comes days after a different federal appeals court, the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, allowed a similar Texas law that had also been challenged by NetChoice to take effect.

Florida argued that the conflict between the 5th Circuit and the Atlanta-based 11th Circuit, which struck down the Florida law, must be resolved by the nation's top court.

NetChoice general counsel Carl Szabo said in a statement that the group agreed the case should be heard by the Supreme Court, and was confident it would prevail.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, signed the state law in May 2021, saying it was needed to prevent ""censorship"" by ""Big Tech."" The move came as many Republicans criticized Facebook and Twitter for banning former President Donald Trump after he praised supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

Tech groups have sought to preserve rights to regulate user content when they believe it may lead to violence, citing concerns that unregulated platforms will enable extremists such as Nazi supporters, terrorists and hostile foreign governments.

The 11th Circuit in May found that most of the law violated the social media companies' right to free speech under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, upholding a lower court judge's ruling. read more

Also in May, the Supreme Court, by a 5-4 vote, temporarily blocked the Texas law while lower courts considered NetChoice's challenge. Conservative Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch said in a dissent that it was not clear how the First Amendment should apply to large social media companies. read more

646,META,2022-07-08,"Whole Foods win shows bosses can ban ""Black Lives Matter"" masks, and more","Related documents Reinert study View















(Reuters) - An appeals court ruling last month that said Whole Foods and its parent Amazon.com Inc can’t be sued for disciplining workers who wore “Black Lives Matter” face masks demonstrates the precarious nature of Americans’ rights on the job.

The June 28 decision by the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals further restricts employees’ ability to change their working conditions at a time when U.S. workplaces have become a locus of divisive cultural battles and disagreements over some Americans’ basic rights.

For instance, days before the ruling, Meta Platforms Inc, which owns Facebook and Instagram, moved to limit internal discussion of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to eliminate the constitutional right to an abortion. A spokesperson for Meta on Friday declined comment on the company's internal policies.

The Whole Foods case was brought in July 2020 by a multi-racial group of more than two dozen employees who claimed the company violated Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bars racial discrimination in the workplace. The statue also prohibits employers from retaliating against workers who oppose bias.

The lawsuit, a proposed nationwide class action, alleged that Whole Foods selectively enforced a dress code that bans visible messages and logos that aren’t company-related. The workers said the policy had gone largely unenforced before the widespread racial justice protests that followed the murder of George Floyd, and that employees had been permitted to wear apparel featuring Pride flag logos, for example.

The group said their Black Lives Matter masks were a show of solidarity with the broader racial-justice movement, as well as a protest against perceived racial bias at Whole Foods. They noted that the company itself had made multiple public statements of support for the BLM movement.

Whole Foods has maintained that it does not discriminate on the basis of race or retaliate against employees who oppose any such discrimination. Neither Whole Foods' spokespeople nor the company's lawyers responded to requests for comment.

Both the Massachusetts district court and the First Circuit– using distinct legal analyses--ultimately concluded that it’s so implausible that Whole Foods discriminated that the case should be dismissed outright. The case did not get to discovery, the stage where parties are compelled to produce documents and other evidence.

In dismissing virtually all the claims in February of last year, Judge Allison Burroughs said there couldn’t possibly have been intentional discrimination because Whole Foods disciplined both Black and non-Black employees. She added that a workplace retaliation claim can’t be based on wearing BLM attire because “it is not done to oppose” any specific discriminatory employment practice.

On appeal, the First Circuit affirmed but on somewhat different grounds. A 3-0 panel concluded that discrimination was implausible because there was an ""obvious alternative explanation"": Whole Foods “did not want to allow the mass expression of a controversial message by employees in their stores,” Judge Kermit Lipez wrote.

That was an argument that Whole Foods hadn't really made, said Shannon Liss-Riordan, a lawyer for the employees. Liss-Riordan said she was disappointed that the First Circuit ""felt it necessary to wade so deeply into issues that should be in the province of the jury.""

Before 2007, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure required that plaintiffs filing discrimination and other civil lawsuits file a ""short and plain statement"" laying out an alleged illegal act. That generally would suffice to get to discovery.

But Supreme Court rulings in 2007 and 2009 established “plausibility pleading” (Bell Atlantic v. Twombly and Ashcoft v. Iqbal). In short, judges scrutinize complaints more closely and dismiss them if they seem implausible based on “judicial experience and common sense.”

Following those rulings, ""dismissals of employment discrimination and civil rights cases have risen significantly,"" according to a 2015 study by Alexander Reinert, law professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.

Individuals were more likely to have cases dismissed, while corporate and governmental plaintiffs didn't see a change in dismissal rates, according to Reinert's study.

Consider how the standard applied in the workers’ case.

On appeal, the First Circuit explicitly discarded the reasoning behind the lower court’s plausibility determination.

The “fact that both Black and non-Black employees were disciplined” doesn’t make a discrimination claim implausible, Lipez wrote. An employer “doubles rather than eliminates Title VII liability,” if it discriminates against some employees based on race and others based on their association with minorities, the court said.

That holding, a small silver lining for workers, marked the first time the First Circuit explicitly recognized that Title VII discrimination claims based on an ""association"" with protected minority groups are viable. Other courts have allowed associational discrimination claims as well as claims based on advocacy for minority workers.

Still, the First Circuit concluded that “common sense” does not suggest that the company discriminated, and decided the case based on its “obvious alternative explanation.""

Indeed, the Supreme Court’s pleading standards basically invite judges to interpose their own subjective views and to do so even before evidence is collected.

It’s perhaps not so surprising, then, that most discrimination claims are judged too implausible at the very outset.

The court's standards often undermine the intent and spirit of anti-bias laws and should be revisited or amended through legislation.

Summary Companies Former Microsoft VP adds to Morgan Lewis' new Seattle outpost

David Howard was previously a practice leader at Dechert















(Reuters) - David Howard, a former litigation and compliance leader at Microsoft Corp, has joined law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius as a partner, the firm said on Wednesday.

Howard, who was previously the software giant's corporate vice president and deputy general counsel for litigation, competition law and compliance, joins Morgan Lewis' new office in Seattle, where the firm launched last summer.

The Philadelphia-founded law firm entered Seattle with a 34-member team, including 14 lawyers from local litigation firm Calfo Eakes, which has since stopped operating. Howard called the Calfo Eakes team ""the finest boutique litigation practice in Seattle.""

Howard said he most recently worked on special projects for Microsoft after stepping down from the litigation chief role after he was diagnosed with stage-four cancer in 2018. He said he is now cancer-free.

Microsoft's current litigation head Jon Palmer said in a statement that Howard ""had an enormous positive impact"" and the company looks forward to working with him at Morgan Lewis.

Howard previously led the white collar and securities litigation practice at law firm Dechert before joining Microsoft in 2010 to lead the litigation team, oversee internal investigations and regulatory enforcement matters globally, the firm said. He also worked as a federal prosecutor and as an attorney on the White House Counsel's task force on the Iran/Contra matter.

Several other law firms have announced attorney hires from big technology companies this week.

Former Apple Inc chief privacy officer Jane Horvath joined law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, and Jamey Goldin, former energy regulatory counsel at Alphabet Inc's Google LLC, rejoined Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough. Kate Patchen, previously associate general counsel for competition at Meta Platforms Inc, started at Covington & Burling and Ryan Richardson, former lead global partnerships counsel at Stripe Inc, joined Davis Wright Tremaine.

While at Microsoft, Howard authored a blog post that made headlines in 2017, in which he said the technology giant planned to move more of its work with law firms to alternative fee arrangements, in a shift away from paying outside firms by the hour.

Without commenting on Microsoft's effort, Howard said he thinks ""there will be continuing discussions between companies and law firms about how best to pay for the value that firms bring to a particular engagement.""

May 23 (Reuters) - Most of a Florida law that sought to stop social media companies from restricting users' political speech violates the companies' free speech rights and cannot be enforced, a federal appeals court ruled on Monday, agreeing with a lower court.

However, a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived a part of the law requiring companies like Meta Platforms' (FB.O) Facebook, Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) to disclose the standards they use to moderate content on their platforms.

The unanimous decision was authored by Circuit Judge Kevin Newsom, who was appointed by Republican former President Donald Trump.

The 11th Circuit ruled that the parts of the law concerning political speech violated social media companies' First Amendment right to decide what to publish. However, it said requiring them to disclose their standards likely did not, ordering the lower court to reconsider that issue.

Bryan Griffin, a spokesperson for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, called the decision ""stupefying"" and said the governor's office was considering appeal. DeSantis signed the law in May 2021.

NetChoice, an industry group including Facebook, Google and Twitter that had sued to challenge the law, noted the U.S. Constitution's protections when asked for comment.

""The First Amendment protects platforms and their right to moderate content as they see fit - and the government can't force them to host content they don't want,"" NetChoice Vice President Carl Szabo said in a statement.

DeSantis, a Republican, previously said the law was needed to prevent ""censorship"" by ""Big Tech,"" pointing to Trump's removal by Twitter and Facebook in January 2021. The companies cited Trump's praise for his supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol after he lost the 2020 presidential election as a reason for the bans.

The Florida law would fine social media companies that ban political candidates. A federal judge last June blocked the law from taking effect. read more

Another federal appeals court earlier this month upheld a Texas law prohibiting social media companies from banning users for their political views. NetChoice is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to block that law. read more

649,META,2023-02-23,Taiwan's Delta Electronics sees EVs powering its double-digit growth,"













TAIPEI, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Taiwan's Delta Electronics Inc (2308.TW), a supplier of power components to companies such as Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), sees ""at least"" double-digit annual growth for the next five years driven by the electric vehicle (EV) boom, it said on Thursday.

Chairman Yancey Hai, in bullish comments on a fourth-quarter earnings call, said the company was benefiting from the shift away from traditional gasoline-powered vehicles to EVs.

""On average the company will grow at a double-digit rate for the next few years. If you say the mid-term is three to five years, I think our goal is to grow at least double digits for the next five years,"" he said.

Components like fans, which had previously mostly gone into goods like personal computers, are now increasingly going into EVs instead, Hai added, after the company reported its fourth-quarter gross profit leapt 32% year-on-year to T$29.6 billion ($974.55 million).

""So EVs are going to be one of the biggest drivers, and also data centres,"" he said, pointing to the ""huge"" centres companies such as Meta Platforms (META.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) are building.

Tesla said last week it will open part of its U.S. charging network to EVs made by rivals as part of a $7.5 billion federal programme to expand the use of EVs and cut carbon emissions.

Hai said that while the supply chain situation for Delta and car factories had improved a lot - the auto industry was particularly hard hit by COVID-related turmoil in China and a global chip shortage - there are still some chips such as microcontrollers facing minor shortages.

650,META,2022-11-17,Ireland sees risk to corporate tax take from tech slowdown,"













DUBLIN, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The slowdown in the global tech sector poses a risk to soaring corporate tax receipts in Ireland next year and in particular in 2024, the finance ministry's chief economist John McCarthy said on Thursday.

Corporate receipts, mainly paid by a small number of large multinational companies whose European headquarters are based in Ireland, have risen by more than 400% in the last 10 years to account for a quarter of Ireland's entire annual tax take.

McCarthy said corporate taxes could reach 22 billion euros ($22.8 billion) this year, above the 21 billion forecast two months ago, and that he was ""more worried"" about later years, especially if there is a shock to the ICT (information and communications technology) sector.

""Within our numbers, we do have a slowdown in the ICT sector built in but since we did the budget (in September), I think it's fair to say the correction in the sector has maybe been a little bit stronger than we might have thought,"" McCarthy told a parliamentary committee.

""There's certainly a risk to 2023, and more likely, maybe the 2024 corporate tax number, that's just on where the sectors are going.""

Ireland is hugely reliant on multinationals that employ over 275,000 people, or one in nine workers. Jobs growth among foreign-owned firms - which includes other large sectors such as biopharma, medtech and financial services - hit record levels in the first half of 2022.

However since then a number of tech companies including Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Twitter and digital payments firm Stripe have laid off Irish staff as part of global cutbacks.

The head of the finance ministry, John Hogan, said it believed the tech cuts were a ""realignment"" after a period of rapid growth.

Highlighting how vulnerable Ireland's public finances are to a more severe multinational shock, McCarthy noted that just 10 firms account for 36% of all the tax paid in the country, when the income tax of their highly paid workers are included.

The surge in corporate taxes pushed Ireland's budget back into a small surplus this year. It expects the surplus to grow to 2.2% of gross national income next year, allowing it to put 6 billion euros of corporate receipts aside into a reserve fund.

A look at the day ahead in markets from Sujata Rao

Fed boss Jerome Powell was reticent on the future policy-tightening path, so markets, ever optimistic, took it as a sign the U.S. central bank will pivot to a slower rate-hike pace.

Note, some argue the opposite, pointing to Powell's allusion to an ""unusually large"" move at the next meeting. But markets chose to go with the former view, cutting rate-hike pricing by year-end to less than 100 bps and allowing the rate-sensitive Nasdaq equity index to end Wednesday 4% higher.

Twelve hours on, some introspection has crept in. Ten-year Treasury yields are up six bps while Wall Street equity futures are in the red.

What is clear is that the Fed, like the European Central Bank, will no longer offer markets explicit forward guidance, ditching a policy adopted during the low-inflation years in favour of a data-dependent approach read more .

So let us look at the data.

652,META,2022-05-26,Canada's Telus abruptly walks away from $830 mln offer for Australia's Appen,"













May 26 (Reuters) - Canadian data analytics software maker Telus International (TIXT.TO) made and then abruptly withdrew a A$1.2 billion ($830 million) buyout approach for Australian rival Appen Ltd (APX.AX), Appen said on Thursday.

""Telus informed us that they were revoking their Indicative Proposal. No reasons were given,"" the Australian software seller said.

Telus did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the withdrawal of the proposal.

On Thursday, trading in Appen's shares was halted after they surged more than 29% to A$8.27, below the indicative offer price of A$9.50 a share, as investors positioned themselves for an eventual buyout — including from another company — while allowing for the possibility the talks could fall through.

""Appen engaged with Telus in good faith...to better understand the conditions of the proposal and to agree an appropriate confidentiality and standstill agreement,"" the Australian firm said in its latest statement.

Appen had signalled in its earlier statement it would engage with Telus to solicit a higher offer.

A deal would have helped build the Canadian firm's offering at a time when corporate clients around the world are moving to automate many services for a customer base that has shifted online due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

It would have also given Appen shareholders an opportunity to recoup investment losses since February when its star customer and Facebook owner Meta Platforms (FB.O) revealed that its advertising revenue was hit by tighter privacy controls installed on Apple Inc computers and smartphones.

""While we do see potential for substantial synergies ... we see Appen as being in a weaker negotiating position to extract a higher bid from Telus International,"" Citi analysts wrote in a note.

""We do see potential for another suitor, especially a competitor to Telus.""

In a short trading update, Appen also said it expected its first-half profit to be materially lower than last year, although it expected a pick-up in earnings in the second half.

The company, which sells a range of automation software including programs to help companies like Facebook collate user data, earlier this year scrapped its outlook for the first time since going public — with an issue price of 50 cents in 2015.

JAKARTA, July 20 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google was among the last remaining tech platforms yet to comply with Indonesia's new licensing rules late on Wednesday, hours from a deadline to sign up and avoid having its services blocked in the country.

Registration is required under rules released in late 2020 that would give authorities broad powers to compel platforms to disclose data of certain users and take down content deemed unlawful or that ""disturbs public order"" within four hours if urgent, and 24 hours if not.

With a young, tech-savvy population of 270 million, Indonesia is a top-10 market in terms of user numbers for a host of social media companies.

""We are aware of the regulation's requirements, and are in the process of taking appropriate action towards compliance,"" a Google representative said, without elaborating.

The communications ministry has said firms that do not register before midnight Wednesday will be reprimanded, fined, and then blocked - a decision that will be reversed once they sign up.

While the ministry did not say when the block would take effect, it is unlikely to be immediate. read more

Twitter was among the latest companies to be added to a communications ministry list of foreign providers that have signed up.

In a statement on Wednesday afternoon the company said it had ""taken appropriate steps to comply"".

Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) units Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp registered on Tuesday, while Spotify (SPOT.N), Netflix (NFLX.O), and ByteDance's TikTok have also signed up, the records showed.

The government says the new rules aim to ensure internet service providers protect consumer data, and that online content is used in a ""positive and productive"" way.

But it can also compel companies to reveal communications and personal data of specific users if requested by law enforcement or government agencies.

Two sources at large internet platforms said they remain concerned about the data and content implications of the regulation and the risk of government overreach.

The Alliance of Independent Journalists in Indonesia said some provisions were open to abuse.

""The consequence could be that news or content that reveals rights violations ...or investigative reports could be considered unsettling...by certain parties, or even by the government or law enforcement,"" the alliance said on Twitter.

March 30 (Reuters) - A black and white, melancholy alternative to Instagram that asks users to post sad pictures of themselves may launch in Russia this week, its creators said, to express sadness at the loss of popular services such as the U.S. photo sharing platform.

Russia restricted access to Instagram from March 14 and subsequently found its owner Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) guilty of ""extremist activities"". read more Moscow is battling with Big Tech to control information flows after it sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Instagram said the decision to block it would affect 80 million users in Russia. Although people can still sometimes access the photo-sharing platform using a Virtual Private Network, domestic alternatives have started appearing, the latest being 'Grustnogram', or 'Sadgram' in English.

What began as a joke among friends quickly became something that could work, one of Grustnogram's creators Ivan Semkin told Reuters on Wednesday.

""We tried to draw a concept, it took a day or two, we tried to make it look good and we realised it came out very well, and it was a seriously good thing that we could show to others.""

Semkin said he was now hoping the government would support their project.

BROKEN HEART 'LIKE'

""Post sad pictures of yourself, show this to your sad friends, be sad together,"" a message on the platform's website read.

An image of the app's planned user interface showed a woman in a fur coat standing in front of St Basil's Cathedral on Moscow's Red Square. The search bar tells users to search for sad compatriots.

Instead of Instagram's heart-shaped 'like' button, Grustnogram offers a broken heart and the option to 'be sad'.

""We are very sad that many high quality and popular services are stopping their work in Russia for various reasons,"" Afisha Daily quoted Alexander Tokarev, another of the service's creators as saying. ""We created Grustnogram to grieve about this together and support each other.""

Tokarev said four people, including two freelance programmers, were behind the project, and said he expected the application to appear for Android devices by the end of the week, and later on the App Store.

Rossgram, an imitation of Instagram in name, design and colour scheme, was set to launch this week, but its founders only succeeded in publishing a video of a prototype hours after the scheduled launch time. read more

BRUSSELS, March 17 (Reuters) - Tech giants will likely challenge a new European Union law aimed at reining in their power with the first cases in a potential wave of litigation expected by year-end, one of the EU's top judges said on Friday.

The Digital Markets Act (DMA), which came into force in November, will classify online platforms with more than 45 million users as gatekeepers, among other criteria.

The gatekeepers - companies that control data and platform access - are subject to a list of do's, such as making their messaging services interoperable, and don'ts, including not favouring their products and services on their platforms.

The list of gatekeepers to which the DMA will apply is due to be announced on Sept. 6 and will likely include Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google, Meta (META.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O).

Those disagreeing with the label and requirements are likely to take their complaint to the Luxembourg-based General Court within months, its president Marc van der Woude said.

The General Court is part of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and deals with cases ranging from competition law to trade and the environment.

""Probably the end of this year, beginning of next year we might see the first cases and I don't think it will stop,"" he told a conference organised by the European Commission.

Some, like Google and Apple, have lobbied intensively against the DMA.

""We remain concerned that some provisions of the DMA will create unnecessary privacy and security vulnerabilities for our users while others will prohibit us from charging for intellectual property in which we invest a great deal,"" it said in March 2022.

Google has echoed those sentiments, and said it was also concerned that the new rules could reduce innovation.

But van der Woude said the DMA was still evolving.

""It's a living organism, this DMA, it's under constant review, obligations will be reviewed and implementing acts. So if I might call it like this, it will be a lawyer's paradise,"" he said.

He said areas of dispute will likely focus on the gatekeeper designation, specifications of their obligations and during enforcement of the DMA.

A contentious area is likely to be the requirement on gatekeepers to notify their acquisitions to the Commission and whether such deals meet the threshold for regulatory scrutiny, van der Woude said.

656,META,2022-11-07,Factbox: Twitter alternatives that users are turning to,"













Nov 7 (Reuters) - After taking Twitter Inc private for $44 billion, Elon Musk has started making changes to the social media platform that have irked some users, making them look for alternatives.

The changes include Musk's decision's to charge for user verification, as well as his opinions on content moderation.

Here are some platforms that are alternatives to Twitter:

MASTODON

Launched in 2016, Mastodon is an open source software for a decentralized social network, with several features that are similar to Twitter.

It is free of advertisements, has a 500-character limit, as well as custom emojis.

Mastodon has more than a million monthly active users and added nearly half a million users since Oct. 27, Chief Executive Eugen Rochko said on Monday.

COHOST

Cohost is an ad-free social media platform. Posts made on the platform fall in a timeline that goes vertically, much like Twitter.

The company said it will charge ""a few bucks a month"" and will soon take tips and sell subscriptions.

TRUTH SOCIAL

Founded by former U.S. President Donald Trump, Truth Social is a platform favored by conservatives and was recently launched on Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iOS and Google-owned Android.

Truth Social is only available to users in the United States.

TRIBEL SOCIAL

A self-described ""grassroots social network"", it is available on Apple's App Store and Android.

The platform allows users to target an audience to enhance engagement on posts and says users can find experts on topics of discussion.

PARLER

Nashville-based Parler, which has agreed to sell itself to the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, is popular with U.S. conservatives.

Founded in 2018, Parler's hands-off approach to content moderation has made it popular among users who disagree with policies of Meta Platform Inc's (META.O) Facebook and Twitter.

TUMBLR

Tumblr is a social media website that was launched in 2007 which allows users to post long-form blog-style content with media elements such as photos and GIFs.

It also allows users to chat with each other much like Twitter's direct messaging function.

CLUBHOUSE

The platform which hosts live audio chatrooms gained popularity at the peak of the pandemic.

The app allows users to chat with people across the world in what it calls ""Rooms"" where someone can start an audio chatroom and discuss topics of interest.

It does not follow an invite-only system for users to access the platform.

657,META,2023-02-02,EU lawmakers agree to tougher rules on targeted political ads,"













BRUSSELS, Feb 2 (Reuters) - EU lawmakers on Thursday agreed to tougher rules on targeted political advertising aimed at countering misinformation during elections, drawing support from Google's YouTube and civil rights activists and concerns from a tech lobbying group.

The draft rules proposed by the European Commission last year are part of the EU move to curb the power of Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O), Meta Platforms and other social media giants, and force them to be more accountable and transparent.

The rules require U.S. tech giants to provide more data on their targeted political ads, with fines up to 4% of their global turnover for breaches.

EU lawmakers toughened up some of the provisions in the Commission's draft and will now have to thrash out details with EU countries before the proposed regulation can become legislation.

""Only personal data explicitly provided for online political advertising can be used by advert providers,"" the European Parliament said

""Micro-targeting, a strategy that uses consumer data and demographics to identify the interests of specific individuals, will therefore not be possible.""

Lawmakers also backed a blanket ban on using minors' data and a ban on non-EU based entities from financing political advertisements in the EU.

They proposed setting up an online repository for all online political ads and related data, and the possibility of periodic penalties for repeated violations. They also proposed that large advertisement service providers be required to suspend their services for 15 days with particular clients over systemic infringements.

YouTube gave a thumbs-up to the lawmakers' proposals against EU countries' much broader remit.

""By focusing new rules on ads and paid-for content, we think the Parliament has reached a position that removes the worrying unintended consequence of limiting political speech online,"" David Wheeldon, head of government affairs and public policy at YouTube, EMEA.

""The current Council proposals go far beyond ads and paid-for content, and could result in a significant reduction in political content and debate online, impacting creators and viewers,"" he said.

Tech lobbying group CCIA called for clarity on the definition of political advertisements and proportionate obligations.

Lawmaker and civil rights advocate Patrick Breyer said Parliament was taking a stand against surveillance-based political advertising.

""From the Donald Trump and Brexit campaigns we have learned that you can very effectively and subconsciously manipulate a voter if you know which message works on them,"" he said.

Virginia Mayo/Pool via REUTERS















BRUSSELS, April 26 (Reuters) - The European Union's internal market chief said on Tuesday that Elon Musk could adapt Twitter (TWTR.N) as he wishes after he acquires the social media site but warned the billionaire that the bloc has strict rules for online platforms to tackle illegal content.

""It will be up to Twitter to adapt themselves ... to our rules,"" Thierry Breton told Reuters and one other media outlet on the deal sealed on Monday by Tesla's (TSLA.O) chief executive to buy Twitter for $44 billion. read more

""I think Elon Musk knows Europe very well. He knows very well that we have some rules for the automotive industry ... and he understands that. So in Europe, in order to protect freedom of speech and to protect individuals, any companies will have to fulfill this obligation.""

Musk, the world's richest person, calls himself a free speech absolutist and has criticised Twitter's moderation of a hugely influential platform that is populated by millions of users and global leaders. read more

The EU has rules under which content forbidden offline is also forbidden online, Breton said.

Under a Digital Services Act (DSA) agreed by the EU's 27 member states and lawmakers last week, Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Meta (FB.O) and other large online platforms will risk hefty fines if they do not control illegal content. read more

Breton said big platforms of more than 45 million users would have to have more moderators than smaller ones, including moderators in every European language, and they would have to open their algorithms to regulators.

Under the DSA, big tech companies face fines up to 6% of their global revenue for violating the rules while repeated breaches could see them banned from doing business in the EU.

The new rules ban advertising aimed at children or based on religion, gender, race and political opinions.

Critics of Musk's takeover of Twitter fear it will mean less moderation and the reinstatement of banned individuals, including former U.S. President Donald Trump. read more

Breton said he had no intention of interfering in the Trump question because such matters would now be regulated in Europe and company boards would not have a say.

""Remember, the information space does not belong to any private company,"" he said. ""The information space is part of our responsibility as politicians. Like territorial space ... airspace, our digital space is our responsibility to organize.""

659,META,2022-09-29,U.S. House approves merger antitrust bill giving states more muscle,"













WASHINGTON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday approved a bill that would sharply raise fees for antitrust reviews of the biggest mergers and strengthen state attorneys general in antitrust fights.

The bipartisan bill, which has yet to pass the U.S. Senate, combines a merger fee bill introduced by Representative Joe Neguse, a Democrat, and a measure to mandate that state attorneys general can pick the venue for antitrust lawsuits, which was introduced by Representative Ken Buck, a Republican.

The bill, which passed the House 242-184, is one of several measures under consideration that would strengthen antitrust enforcers to rein in Big Tech.

One bill would bar Big Tech companies like Alphabet's Google and Amazon.com from preferencing their own products on platforms while another addresses Apple's (AAPL.O) and Google's clout in their app stores. Hopes are dimming that they will become law this year.

The legislation the House approved on Thursday would lower fees paid for antitrust reviews of smaller deals to as little as $30,000. Bigger deals would be more expensive. Deals worth $5 billion or more would pay $2.25 million for their review.

A previous version of the filing fee bill had included budget increases for the U.S. Justice Department's Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission, but those have been removed, according to a congressional aide.

The U.S. Senate has passed a bill giving state attorneys general the right to pick the venue for antitrust fights but has not passed a measure to update merger filing fees.

Texas, along with other states, brought an antitrust action against Alphabet Inc's Google in 2020 that the search and advertising giant succeeded in moving from Texas to a New York court, angering conservatives.

In the Senate, the House bill has attracted public support from Republicans Mike Lee, Chuck Grassley and Tom Cotton as well as Democrats Amy Klobuchar and Dick Durbin. It is not immediately known when or if the Senate will vote on the bill.

Opposition to the bill included Representative Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat, who joined with at least four other Democrats from the home state of Silicon Valley, urging that the bill be defeated because of the venue measure. California is home to some of the biggest tech companies, including Google and Meta Platforms' (META.O) Facebook.

660,META,2023-03-16,File Raiffeisen’s sanctions-bypass idea in the bin,"













LONDON, March 16 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Raiffeisen Bank International thinks it may have found a clever way to repatriate a small part of its Russian assets. The $5 billion Austrian bank, one of only two European lenders along with UniCredit (CRDI.MI) still operating in Moscow, is suggesting it could swap up to 400 million euros’ worth of assets for an equivalent sum of frozen cash that Russia’s Sberbank (SBER.MM) holds in Europe after a series of divestments. Raiffeisen may be able to demonstrate that the scheme would not violate the letter of sanctions. It will find it harder to argue that it is abiding by their spirit.

Russia has long been a cash cow for Raiffeisen, accounting for more than half its 3.8 billion euros of net profit last year. And it has been reluctant to shutter its operations in the country, for lack of a buyer at a decent price. Hence the idea to swap its stranded roubles against the frozen euros accumulated by Sberbank, the Kremlin-owned bank forced to unwind its operations by the war in Ukraine. Up to 400 million euros of its assets are now sitting idle in a frozen fund.

According to sources involved in the talks, Raiffeisen could transfer to Sberbank either some debt owed by Raiffeisen Russia to its mother company, or the rights to a special dividend of the Russian unit. Promoters of the idea, now being tested with regulators, reckon this might conform with sanctions because the swap would not involve sending hard currency to Russia. In reality, it would allow Russia’s largest bank to recover its frozen money, opening a massive loophole in the sanctions regime. (By Pierre Briancon)

661,META,2023-02-17,NatWest calls time on UK banks’ rate-hike party,"













LONDON, Feb 17 (Reuters Breakingviews) - British lenders have had a great six months. Shares in NatWest (NWG.L) and Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) rose 17% and 16% respectively between Aug. 16 and Thursday, as fears of a deep recession faded and investors started anticipating fat bank lending margins due to higher rates. But NatWest Chief Executive Alison Rose has brought that excitement to an end. The 28 billion pound state-owned lender on Friday set a 3.2% target for its 2023 net interest margin – the key measure of how much lending income banks make after subtracting the interest paid on deposits. That compares with 2.85% last year and 2.3% in 2021. But NatWest’s shares fell by almost a tenth. The problem is that 3.2% is exactly what it posted in the fourth quarter of 2022; analysts were penciling in 3.38% for 2023.

It’s surprising that Rose thinks lending margins have maxed out already. Higher rates take a while to feed into revenue because so many borrowers have long-term or fixed-rate debt, which reprices slowly. Adding to the mystery is that Rose’s expected net interest margin in 2023 is based on a steady 4% Bank of England base rate, which means it isn’t just down to expected rate cuts later in the year. One explanation for the disappointing forecast is that deposit costs are going up on savings accounts. That would be a cause for celebration among households and firms with spare cash, but it might bring the bank share-price party to an end. (By Liam Proud)

HONG KONG, Feb 20 (Reuters Breakingviews) - China's Shein is aiming high. The online clothing retailer is confident it can generate $7.5 billion in profit in 2025 on the back of doubling sales to $58.5 billion, according to the Financial Times, citing a presentation shown to investors as it gears up for an initial public offering. That's well above annual revenue and profit forecasts, Refinitiv data shows, for brick-and-mortar rivals Inditex (ITX.MC), known for its Zara brand, and Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing (9983.T).

Shein’s top-line growth slowed from 57% in 2021 to 45% last year; the company expects that to continue, with its 2025 target implying average annual expansion of 37%. That still trounces the single-digit pace expected at its global competitors. Meanwhile, Shein's projected 13% profit margin dwarfs that of web retailers like China's JD.com (9618.HK).

Rising costs and new competition make that a stretch. The $118 billion PDD (PDD.O) recently rolled out its Temu shopping service; it is now the most downloaded app in the United States. To hit its financial goals, Shein will probably have to adapt its business model to include more premium labels and allow third parties to sell products via its app.

Using the same 2.4 times forecast 2025 sales multiple the Inditex enterprise trades on, Shein's valuation could top $140 billion. The company has talked the talk; now it has to walk the catwalk. (By Robyn Mak)

663,META,2023-03-02,Musk: 'AI stresses me out',"













DETROIT, March 1 (Reuters) - Elon Musk has clashed often with securities regulators and highway safety authorities, but there's one area the Tesla and Twitter chief says the government should regulate now: Artificial Intelligence.

""AI stresses me out,"" Musk said near the end of a more than three-hour presentation to Tesla investors about company plans.

Tesla's own ambitious artificial intelligence efforts had a featured role in the presentation of Musk's ""Master Plan 3"", the third part of a series of papers on how to expand Tesla and convert the world to clean energy.

There was a video of a Optimus humanoid robot, being developed by Tesla, manipulating parts of other Optimus robots as if it intended to assemble replicas of itself. Executives gave detailed presentations about how Tesla is using artificial intelligence technology to train vehicles to drive themselves - an effort under scrutiny by federal and state authorities.

But when asked by an analyst if AI could help Tesla build cars, Musk took a less optimistic line.

""I don't see AI helping us make cars any time soon,"" he said. ""At that point ... there's no point in any of us working.""

Earlier this week, Musk appeared to confirm via Twitter reports that he is recruiting a team of AI technologists to build a competitor to OpenAI's text-based ChatGPT, backed by Microsoft Corp, (MSFT.O) and similar systems under development at Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and other large technology platforms.

Musk tweeted last December that ChatGPT, a text-based chatbot developed by OpenAI that can draft prose, poetry or even computer code on command, ""is scary good. We are not far from dangerously strong AI."" He amplified those concerns for the audience of Tesla analysts Wednesday.

""I'm a little worried about the AI stuff,"" Musk said from a stage where he was flanked by 16 Tesla executives, including Autopilot head.

""We need some kind of, like, regulatory authority or something overseeing AI development,"" Musk said. ""Make sure it's operating in the public interest. It's quite dangerous technology. I fear I may have done some things to accelerate it.""

Tesla's effort to enable its cars to drive themselves safely is ""obviously useful"" AI, Musk said.

""I don't know. Tesla is doing good things in AI,"" he said. Musk paused, then sighed. ""This one stresses me out. I don't know what to say about it.""

664,META,2023-01-31,Norway wealth fund posts record $164 billion loss,"[1/3] Norway wealth fund CEO Nicolai Tangen presents the results for 2022, at a news conference in Oslo, Norway January 31, 2023. NTB/Heiko Junge via REUTERS

Summary

Summary Companies Loss in 2022 exceeds previous record from 2008

Inflation, geopolitical tensions remain risk factors

Record inflow of money from oil and gas industry















OSLO, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Norway's wealth fund, one of the world's largest investors, posted a record loss of 1.64 trillion crowns ($164.4 billion) for 2022, bringing to an end a three-year run of soaring profits as stocks and bonds were hit by the Ukraine war and inflation.

The previous largest loss was 633 billion crowns in 2008.

It ends a record-breaking streak for the fund, where annual returns exceeded one trillion crowns in each of the three years from 2019 to 2021, amounting to more than four trillion crowns combined.

""We are invested in 9,000 companies in 70 countries. There is just nowhere to hide,"" fund Chief Executive Nicolai Tangen told a news conference.

The single biggest stock market loss came from the fund's stake in Amazon (AMZN.O), which declined in value by 56 billion crowns, followed by a loss in shares of Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O) of 52 billion and in Tesla (TSLA.O) with 47 billion.

Still, despite the record loss, the value of the fund rose overall by 89 billion crowns or $8.9 billion year-on-year, partly due to the weak Norwegian currency and a record 1.1 trillion crowns of cash inflows.

The inflows in 2022 were nearly three times the previous record, of 386 billion crowns, set in 2008.

The fund invests the Norwegian state's revenues from petroleum production. As a major crude exporter and Europe's largest gas supplier after a drop in Russian gas flows, Norway benefited from high energy prices due to the war in Ukraine.

""We have to be very conscious of the fact that the inflow came against a tragic backdrop in Europe,"" Tangen said.

""But it is an isolated mathematical fact that when oil and gas prices are higher, there is more revenue to the (Norwegian) government and more inflow into the fund.""

The fund owns on average 1.3% of all listed stocks. It also invests in bonds, unlisted real estate and renewable energy projects.

Looking ahead, Tangen said inflation would continue to be a worry.

""Inflation remains a risk factor and, in particular, tied into what will happen when China really kicks in on the consumption side because it could drive a lot of prices globally,"" Tangen told Reuters.

""And then of course we have still geopolitical hotspots.""

The fund's return on investment in 2022 stood at minus 14.1% for the year, which was 0.88 percentage point better than the return on the fund's benchmark index.

665,META,2023-01-31,EU studying whether Big Tech should pay network costs -EU document,"













BRUSSELS, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The European Union (EU) will consult the technology and telecoms sectors on whether tech giants like Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O), Meta (META.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) should subsidize network costs, according to a Commission document seen by Reuters on Tuesday.

EU telecoms providers including Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), Orange (ORAN.PA), Telefonica (TEF.MC) and Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) say the six largest content providers account for more than half of data internet traffic and should contribute their fair share. The providers also point to Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

The tech giants say the idea is equivalent to an internet traffic tax that could interfere with Europe's net neutrality rules treating all users equally.

The commission's query is part of a 19-page document the EU executive drafted before it proposes legislation.

The EU executive is expected to publish the document next week to garner feedback from telecoms operators and Big Tech, although the timing may change. The next step is an agreement with EU countries and lawmakers to finalise the legislation.

""Some stakeholders have suggested a mandatory mechanism of direct payments from CAPs (content application providers)/LTGs (large traffic generator) to contribute to finance network deployment. Do you support such suggestion and if so why? If no, why not?"" the questionnaire asked.

The questionnaire also asks who the mechanism should apply t; whether it would negatively impact innovation, the internet ecosystem and consumers; and whether the EU should create a continental or digital levy or fund.

The EU will also query Big Tech and telecoms providers' investment spending and future developments, confirming a Reuters story this month.

""The Commission's questionnaire is basically asking questions that seek to justify the 'fair share' narrative pushed by big telcos. What is more, it seems to ignore the impact on consumers and fundamental net neutrality protections,"" an industry source said.

""The Commission is also asking for detailed business information, such as peering contracts, that is usually confidential. This effectively excludes key stakeholders from taking part.

666,META,2022-11-14,Amazon to lay off thousands of employees -source,"













Nov 14 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) is planning to lay off around 10,000 employees in corporate and technology roles beginning this week, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday, in what would amount to its biggest such reduction to date.

The cuts, earlier reported by the New York Times, would represent about 3% of Amazon's corporate staff. The exact number may vary as businesses within Amazon review their priorities, the source told Reuters.

The online retailer plans to eliminate jobs in its devices organization, which makes voice-controlled ""Alexa"" gadgets and home-security cameras, as well as in its human-resources and retail divisions, the person said. Amazon's time frame for informing staff remained unclear.

The source attributed the reduction to the uncertain macroeconomic environment faced by Amazon and other companies.

The news follows a wave of layoffs across the technology sector, which is wary of recession after years of rapid hiring. Just last week, Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) said it would cut more than 11,000 jobs, or 13% of its workforce, to rein in costs.

Seattle-based Amazon is predicting a slowdown in sales growth for the typically lucrative holiday season.

On a call with reporters last month, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said the company saw signs of tighter household budgets for shopping, and it continued to wrestle with high inflation and energy costs.

It since has said it would freeze incremental corporate hiring for several months.

Amazon's devices unit in some recent years has posted an annual operating loss of more than $5 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported last week. The company has weighed whether to focus on new capabilities for Alexa when some customers use the voice assistant for just a few tasks, the report said.

Company-wide, taking warehouse and transportation jobs into account, which made Amazon's headcount more than 1.5 million as of Sept. 30, the planned cuts amounted to less than 1% of the retailer's workforce.

Shares of Amazon have lost more than 40% of their value this year. They were down 1.1% at $99.67 on Monday afternoon.

667,META,2022-11-30,"DoorDash cuts 1,250 jobs to control ballooning costs","













Nov 30 (Reuters) - DoorDash Inc (DASH.N) said on Wednesday it was cutting about 1,250 jobs, or 6% of its total workforce, as the food-delivery company looks to keep a lid on costs to cope with a slowdown in demand. DoorDash, went on a hiring spree to cater to a flood of orders from people stuck at home during the height of the pandemic, but a sudden drop in demand from inflation-wary customers has left the company grappling with ballooning costs.

""We were not as rigorous as we should have been in managing our team growth ... That's on me. As a result, operating expenses grew quickly,"" Chief Executive Tony Xu said in a memo to employees that was posted on the company's website.

""Given how quickly we hired, our operating expenses - if left unabated - would continue to outgrow our revenue.""

The company's shares, which have fallen about 64% this year, were up about 5% in morning trade.

DoorDash, which has delivery partnerships with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA.O) and Shake Shack (SHAK.N), has about 20,000 employees.

""Greater emphasis on its cost structure is a welcoming sign, especially given the potential for consumer spending to deteriorate faster than expected,"" said Angelo Zino, analyst at CFRA Research.

Earlier this month, DoorDash reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly net loss of $295 million, raising questions about the growth prospect of delivery firms as economies reopen.

British food delivery company Deliveroo (ROO.L) said in late October that sales growth would be at the lower end of its previous forecast.

DoorDash joins a list of multinational American firms, including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and Twitter Inc, that have laid off thousands of employees in recent weeks as they brace for a potential economic downturn. read more

While DoorDash's Xu reiterated that the business has been more resilient compared with other e-commerce companies, he said reducing non-headcount operating expenses ""wouldn't close the gap.""

668,META,2022-10-27,Wall St loses over $200 billion in value after report from Amazon,"













Oct 27 (Reuters) - Over $200 billion in U.S. stock market value went up in smoke in extended trade on Thursday, after a weak forecast from Amazon (AMZN.O) added to a string of downbeat quarterly reports from Big Tech companies.

Amazon's stock tumbled 17% after the bell, wiping out $190 billion in market capitalization after the retail and technology heavyweight projected a holiday slump that would leave current-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates.

Also after the bell, Apple (AAPL.O) shares fell about 1%, erasing about $30 billion of its stock market value after the Cupertino, California company reported quarterly iPhone sales that fell short of Wall Street targets.

The latest in a string of poor quarterly results from some of Wall Street's most widely owned companies underscores deep worries about the health of the global economy as central banks raise interest rates in a battle against inflation.

""Big Tech companies are not impervious to slowdowns in the economy, particularly if they are consumer driven,"" said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.

""As the Fed embarks on this planned slowdown, it is eating away at some of their consumer-faced businesses, and given their high multiples it is causing big contractions in their stock prices,"" Meckler said.

Amazon's weak report sent Nasdaq futures tumbling about 3%, showing traders expect Wall Street to open with a deep decline on Friday. Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) dropped about 1% each, adding to losses following their own poorly received quarterly reports on Tuesday.

Thursday's late-day reports also followed disappointing results from Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (META.O) that earlier sent its stock plummeting 25%. Thursday's drop left Meta's stock market value at about $260 billion, with the one-time behemoth now about the 20th most valuable company on Wall Street.

If Amazon's drop after hours is reflected in Friday's trading session, it will have been its deepest one-day loss since 2006.

Among a handful of winners late on Thursday, Pinterest (PINS.N) surged 12% after the social media platform reported higher than expected quarterly revenue, while Intel (INTC.O) climbed 6%, despite forecasting annual revenue below analysts' estimates.

669,META,2022-07-20,U.S. Supreme Court welcomes new crop of clerks in fraught year,"













(Reuters) - Graduates of the law schools at Yale, Harvard and Stanford universities dominate the incoming class of U.S. Supreme Court clerks, keeping with tradition.

The high court on Wednesday confirmed its list of the new law clerks who will serve in its upcoming October term — the first group to join the court since the May leak of its draft opinion overturning a constitutional right to abortion.

The final decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health, issued in June, has divided the country and led to long-running protests at the homes of the court's conservative justices.

The source of the leak, which Chief Justice John Roberts called a ""betrayal of the confidences of the court,"" is still publicly unknown. Suspicion has fallen partly on the court's clerks due to their access to draft opinions.

The amount of attention on the court and its clerks may be unusual this year, but the newest group comes with familiar Ivy League pedigrees.

Yale Law School has the most alumni clerks beginning clerkships on Oct. 1, at 12. Harvard is next with eight clerks, followed by Stanford with seven, according to a Reuters analysis.

Among the 38 total new clerks, all but four graduated from schools in the so-called T-14, those ranked in the top 14 by U.S. News & World Report. The Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University, ranked No. 30, has two alumni headed to the high court.

Clerks can command signing bonuses worth $400,000 at major U.S. law firms after their stint ends at the court.

Many go onto prestigious careers as private lawyers or judges. A January analysis of retired justice Stephen Breyer’s 120-plus clerks found that about a third of them pursued careers in large law firms, some leading nationwide appellate practices.

One of Breyer's clerks, Ketanji Brown Jackson, replaced him on the high court on June 30. Jackson’s first four clerks are two men and two women, one of whom has advocated for the judiciary to do more to prevent sexual harassment.

Among next term’s other new clerks is Giuliana Cipollone, a 2021 graduate of Stanford Law School and the daughter of former Trump White House counsel Pat Cipollone, a connection first reported in March by legal blogger David Lat.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly















Feb 3 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever.

The Fed, ECB, and BoE have spoken, and the market's message is: We hear you, but we don't believe you.

All three raised interest rates as expected this week, said they will act again at upcoming meetings, and with varying degrees of guidance and conviction said they stand ready to tighten even further if inflation conditions warrant it.

But investors aren't buying it. Wall Street and world stocks have jumped, bond yields are tumbling, and economists and rates futures markets are scaling back central bank hiking expectations.

Contrary to what policymakers are surely aiming for, financial conditions are easing. Look how Germany's 10-year bond yield reacted on Thursday to ECB president Lagarde's press conference - down 20 basis points, one of the biggest falls since the euro was launched in 1999.

According to Goldman Sachs, U.S. financial conditions are the loosest since August and have eased 150 basis points since mid-October. That's despite 225 bps of rate hikes since September.

The falling dollar and lower Treasury yields have helped loosen financial conditions across most of emerging Asia in recent weeks too. Regional risk appetite remains firm, even though a pause in the equity rally may be overdue.

The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index only has to rise around 0.7% on Friday - not an insurmountable challenge on the back of Wall Street's latest bounce - to post its sixth consecutive weekly gain.

That would mark 12 increases out of the last 14 weeks, while the MSCI World index has had only one down day in the last 10. Remarkable runs.

Watch for outsized moves in Asian tech stocks on Friday following the 23% surge in Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) shares. Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) also reported results after the U.S. close.

On the economic data front, a batch of PMI reports will give the latest insight into the health of several key economies in Asia, including China and India, while December retail sales figures from Hong Kong and Singapore will also be released.

671,META,2023-01-31,Morning Bid: Fed games,"













Feb 1 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in markets from Stephen Culp, New York stock market reporter.

Asian stocks are primed for a green Wednesday on the heels of a broad rally on Wall Street, as a slew of economic data suggested the Federal Reserve's restrictive monetary policy is working as directed.

All three major U.S. stock indexes ended bright green and notched welcome gains for the month.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its biggest January percentage advance in 22 years.

Risk appetite was largely fueled by economic data, specifically the Employment Cost Index (ECI) which decelerated in the fourth quarter to its slowest growth in a year - yet another sign that decades-high inflation is beginning to cool.

This is welcome news for the Fed, which is expected to punctuate its two-day monetary policy meeting on Wednesday with a 25 basis point hike to the Fed funds target rate, its latest salvo in its battle against inflation.

Upbeat quarterly results from a handful of major industrial firms, including Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and General Motors Co (GM.N) added muscle to the rally.

On Wednesday, market participants will digest factory and labor market data and parse the Fed's statement and Chairman Jerome Powell's remarks at the subsequent press conference.

Social media bellwether Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) posts results after Wednesday's bell as a prologue to Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), all slated for Thursday after the bell.

Crude prices , advanced after EIA data showed solid U.S. energy demand.

Factory data from China showed the manufacturing sector entered expansion territory after Beijing relaxed its COVID-19 restrictions, further hinting at a global demand rebound.

672,META,2023-02-07,"Factbox: U.S. stock buybacks so far in 2023: big money, fewer companies","













NEW YORK, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Corporate stock buybacks are offering investors a measure of excitement in what has been a gloomy earnings season.

Chevron Corp (CVX.N) late last month said it would triple its budget for share buybacks to $75 billion.

The oil major's announcement was followed last week by Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), the parent of Facebook which last week unveiled a $40 billion buyback.

Bolstered by those announcements, corporate buybacks are on pace for a stronger start to 2023 than a year ago in terms of dollar value -- though fewer companies are announcing them. Here's a closer look at buyback trends:

** Companies have announced $173.5 billion worth of planned buybacks so far this year, just over double last year's pace, according to data from EPFR TrimTabs as of Monday. In 2022, buyback announcements reached a record $1.22 trillion, according to EPFR TrimTabs.

** However, fewer companies have announced buybacks so far this year. So far in 2023, 78 companies have announced buybacks compared with 125 companies as of this time last year, according to EPFR TrimTabs, which tracks announcements by companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and American Stock Exchange.

** S&P 500 companies are expected to have completed $220 billion in buybacks during the fourth quarter of 2022, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. That is up from $210.8 billion in the third quarter, but down from $270 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021.

** 2023 should be the first fiscal year with at least $1 trillion in completed S&P 500 company buybacks, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.

** Buybacks have contributed 3.7% to S&P 500 earnings-per-share growth for the fourth quarter, according to data from Credit Suisse as of Friday. Overall, S&P 500 earnings are on track to have declined 2.1% in the quarter as of Friday, according to Credit Suisse.

** The S&P 500 buyback index (.SPBUYUP), which is designed to measure performance of stocks with the highest buyback ratios, was up 8.9% in 2023 as of Friday versus a 7.7% gain for the broad S&P 500 (.SPX) during that time. The buyback index fell 12.7% in 2022 versus a 19.4% drop for the overall S&P 500.

673,META,2023-01-05,Amazon layoff signals more pain for tech sector as recession fears mount,"













Jan 5 (Reuters) - The massive job cuts by Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), one of the biggest private employers in the United States, show the wave of layoff sweeping through the tech sector could stretch into 2023 as companies rush to cut costs, analysts said on Thursday.

As a demand boom during the pandemic rapidly turns into bust, tech companies shed more than 150,000 workers in 2022, according to tracking site Layoffs.fyi, a number that is growing as growth in the world's biggest economies start to slow.

The layoffs brought back memories of the dot-com bubble at the start of the century and the 2008 financial crisis when tech companies cut jobs in thousands to reduce spending.

""They're trying to protect themselves so that they're not caught in the 2008-2009 cycle that we had,"" said Greg Selker, managing director at executive search firm Stanton Chase.

During the global pandemic, companies ramped up hiring only to reverse course in 2022, with the tech sector leading the job cuts, which according to executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc, surged 649% from 2021.

""It is also giving them an advantage to frankly be more responsible for some of the aggressive hiring that occurred during the pandemic,"" Selker said.

The drop in demand amid a steep rise in borrowing costs has led several executives from the sector to admit they hired in excess during the COVID-19 crisis. read more

Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) axed 11,000 jobs last year, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg saying he had wrongly expected that the pandemic boom would keep on going.

Tech giants Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) have already hinted at cost-cuts, including layoffs.

Salesforce Inc (CRM.N) top boss Marc Benioff said on Wednesday the enterprise software company had hired ""too many people"" as he announced plans to cut 10% of the jobs.

For Amazon, growth in its cloud unit that brings most of its profit has slowed as businesses cut back spending, while its online retail unit is reeling from strained consumer budgets due to rising prices.

Aug 3 (Reuters) - Shares of AMTD Digital plunged 40% on Wednesday to snap an eye-popping rally fueled by retail investors this week that briefly took the Hong Kong-based fintech's market value past that of Facebook-owner Meta Platforms.

The company's market capitalization closed above $300 billion in a 128% jump on Tuesday, reminding investors of the meme stock mania last year that drove record rallies in shares of companies such as GameStop (GME.N) and AMC (AMC.N).

The stock has risen about 21,000% since its July IPO, when it listed at a price of $7.80. It was trading at $1014.98 on Wednesday.

""It sure looks a lot like a pump-and-dump,"" Nate Anderson, founder of Hindenburg Research, said, adding that it does not have a position in AMTD Digital. ""It seems to have caught on among retail investors, which is often the fuel for these situations.""

In a typical pump-and-dump scheme, investors create artificial demand to boost companies' stock prices and then sell their own shares at a profit causing prices to fall, saddling others investors with losses.

AMTD Digital was also the most-mentioned stock on Reddit.com, the social media platform central to the meme stock craze of 2021. read more

The company said on Tuesday there was no material change or event related to the company's business and operating activities since the IPO date and that it was monitoring the share volatility.

The fintech firm, which provides loans and services to startups in exchange for fees, has a low float and is tightly controlled by parent company AMTD Idea (AMTD.N).

AMTD Idea's shares also slid 4% after closing Tuesday with a market value of $2.6 billion.

""(AMTD Digital) is clearly the newest meme stock with bands of retail traders purchasing the stock at the same time, pushing the price sharply higher,"" said Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor.

There has been a similar, but smaller, surge in some other recently listed U.S. companies, including Getty Images which jumped over 200% since its debut on July 25.

""Should this market rebound have more legs, we expect retail investors' appetite for speculative stocks to continue, as they seek the opportunity to further scratch back the losses they’ve accumulated through the year,"" said Lucas Mantle, a data science analyst at Vanda Research.

675,META,2022-04-07,Russia takes steps to punish Google over YouTube 'fakes',"













April 7 (Reuters) - Russia's communications watchdog said on Thursday it was taking steps to punish Google (GOOGL.O), including a ban on advertising the platform and its information services, for violating Russian law.

The measures will apply to Google Search, the Google Play app store, YouTube, YouTube Music, Google Chat and Gmail.

Roskomnadzor accused Google's YouTube video-sharing platform, which has shut out Russian state-funded media globally, of becoming ""one of the key platforms spreading fakes (fake images) about the course of (Russia's) special military operation on the territory of Ukraine, discrediting the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation"".

It said the measures against Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., which include a warning in search engines saying it is violating Russian law, would remain in place until it complied with legislation.

The deputy head of the State Duma parliamentary committee on information policy, Anton Gorelkin, wrote on Telegram that the Russian search engine Yandex (YNDX.O) would add a warning to Google services.

Google spent 243 million roubles ($3.2 million) on advertising in Russia in 2021, excluding VAT, according to a report in the Kommersant newspaper citing the industry publication AdIndex.

Google, which stopped selling online advertising in Russia on March 3, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Last month, Russia demanded that Google stop spreading what it called threats against Russian citizens on YouTube.

The regulator also blocked Google's news aggregator service in March, accusing it of giving access to fake material about the military operation in Ukraine.

The Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, last month passed a law providing for up to 15 years' jail for intentionally spreading ""fake"" news at variance with government accounts about the military. read more

The desire to control information about its campaign in Ukraine has intensified Moscow's long-standing tensions with foreign tech firms.

Outraged that Meta Platforms (FB.O) was allowing social media users in Ukraine to post messages such as ""Death to the Russian invaders"", Moscow blocked Instagram in March, having already cut off access to Facebook because of what it said were the platform's restrictions on Russian media. read more

Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists.

Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions in an effort to force Russia to withdraw its forces. ($1 = 76.6650 roubles)

Summary Companies TikTok under pressure after data access admission last moth

Commission says discussed TikTok's readiness for new EU rules















BRUSSELS, Jan 10 (Reuters) - TikTok Chief Executive Shou Zi Chew on a visit to Brussels on Tuesday sought to reassure the European Union the app would respect the bloc's increasingly stringent tech rules and commitments to privacy and child safety.

The short-video app, which is owned by Chinese technology conglomerate ByteDance, has for the last three years worked to counter U.S. concerns over whether the personal data of its citizens can be accessed and its content manipulated by China's Communist Party or any other entity under Beijing's influence.

Pressure on the company increased following its admission last month that some of its employees improperly accessed TikTok user data of two journalists to try to identify the source of information leaks to the media.

Compared to rivals Meta (META.O) and Twitter, TikTok has a relatively low profile with regulators in the 27-country bloc.

But that could change as stringent tech rules to curb the power of Big Tech and require online platforms to do more to police the internet for illegal content go into force in the coming months.

Chew's series of meetings in Brussels began with EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager.

""The objective of the meeting with TikTok was to review how the company is preparing for complying with its obligations under the European Commission's regulation, namely the Digital Services Act (DSA) and possibly under the Digital Markets Act (DMA),"" the EU executive said in a statement.

""At the meeting the parties also discussed GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and matters of privacy and data transfer obligations with a reference to the recent press reporting on aggressive data harvesting and surveillance in the U.S,"" it said.

Values and Transparency Commissioner Vera Jourova listed her concerns to Chew, among them the protection of Europeans' personal data, child safety and the spread of Russian disinformation on the platform as well as the transparency of political advertising.

""I count on TikTok to fully execute its commitments to go the extra mile in respecting EU law and regaining trust of European regulators,"" she said in a statement after the meeting.

EU justice chief Didier Reynders told Chew that TikTok could do more to remove hate content on its platform.

Tiktok said it was committed to complying with EU rules in a transparent way.

""It's a top priority for us to be ready for this,"" its vice-president for public policy, Europe, Theo Bertram, said in a tweet.

677,META,2023-02-17,TikTok planning 2 more data centers in Europe amid data security concerns,"













BRUSSELS, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Chinese social media company TikTok plans to open two more data centers in Europe, a senior executive said on Friday, a move that could mitigate concerns over the security of users' data and ease regulatory pressure on the company.

TikTok has been seeking to assure governments and regulators that users' personal data cannot be accessed and its content cannot be manipulated by China's Communist Party or anyone else under Beijing's influence.

The short video-sharing app, owned by China's ByteDance, aims to expand its European data storage, TikTok's general manager for operations in Europe Rich Waterworth said in a blog post.

""We are at an advanced stage of finalising a plan for a second data centre in Ireland with a third party service provider, in addition to the site announced last year,"" he said.

""We're also in talks to establish a third data centre in Europe to further complement our planned operations in Ireland. European TikTok user data will begin migrating this year, continuing into 2024,"" Waterworth said.

The company on Friday also reported on average 125 million monthly active users in EU between August 2022 to January 2023, subjecting it to stricter EU online content rules known as the Digital Services Act (DSA).

The DSA labels companies with more than 45 million users as very large online platforms and require them to do risk management, external and independent auditing, share data with authorities and researchers and adopt a code of conduct.

The European Commission had given online platforms and search engines until Feb. 17 to publish their monthly active users. Very large online platforms have four months to comply with the rules or risk fines.

Twitter on Thursday said it has 100.9 million average monthly users in the EU, based on an estimation of the last 45 days.

Alphabet (GOOGL.O) provided one set of numbers based on users' accounts and another set based on signed-out recipients, saying that users can access its services whether they sign into an account or when they are signed out.

It said the average monthly number of signed-in users totalled 278.6 million at Google Maps, 274.6 million at Google Play, 332 million at Google Search, 74.9 million at Shopping and 401.7 million at YouTube.

Earlier this week, Meta Platform (META.O) said it had 255 million average monthly active users on Facebook in the EU and about 250 million average monthly active users on Instagram in the last six months of 2022.

678,META,2022-07-14,"Half of Holocaust-related posts on Telegram deny or distort facts, U.N. says","













July 14 (Reuters) - Around half the public content related to the Holocaust on the Telegram messaging service denies or distorts facts about the killing of six million of Europe's Jews in the Holocaust, according to a new study by the United Nations cultural agency.

The UNESCO report found that 80% of public German-language messages about the Nazi genocide during World War Two denied or distorted facts, and the same was true for 50% of English- and French-language posts about the Holocaust.

The research analysed 4,000 Holocaust-related posts across five top social media platforms, and found denial or distortion in 19% of content on Twitter (TWTR.N), 17% on TikTok, 8% on Facebook and 3% on Instagram.

The report defined distortion as posts that celebrated the genocide, smeared or blamed its victims, equated it to other events such as Israeli policy towards Palestinians, or omitted facts about Nazi perpetrators and their collaborators.

Asked about the report, a Telegram spokesperson said: ""Telegram is a platform for free speech where people are welcome to peacefully express their opinions, including those we do not agree with.""

The spokesperson said posts that glorified or encouraged violence or its perpetrators were forbidden, and removed through moderation or user reports.

Launched in 2013, Dubai-based Telegram is active in 155 countries, according to tech website Backlinko. Other social media companies mentioned in the report did not respond to requests for comment.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement: ""We must never forget how easily hate speech can turn to hate crime; how ignorance or indifference can lead to intolerance; or how silence in the face of bigotry is complicity,""

""Today, the cracks are impossible to ignore,"" Guterres said.

He said the findings showed intimate links between Holocaust denial and other online violence rooted in racism, misogyny and xenophobia.

Mark Zuckerberg's Meta Platforms (META.O) owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, while TikTok is owned by China's ByteDance. Twitter is facing a possible takeover from Elon Musk, the world's richest man. read more

UNESCO found that even on moderated platforms, the deniers and distorters eluded censors by using humorous and parodic memes to normalise anti-Semitic ideas.

It recommended that governments invest in developing public media literacy and that platforms take action against such content and redirect to verified information.

679,META,2023-01-04,"Factbox: FACTBOX Tech firms, Wall Street lead job cuts in Corporate America","













Jan 10 (Reuters) - Big Tech firms and Wall Street titans are leading a string of layoffs across corporate America as companies look to rein in costs to ride out the economic downturn.

Rapid interest rate hikes, weak consumer demand and an economic slowdown in China have forced firms such as Amazon, Walt Disney, Facebook-owner Meta and American banks to trim their workforce.

As a pandemic-led demand boom rapidly fades, tech companies shed more than 150,000 workers in 2022, according to tracking site Layoffs.fyi, and more layoffs are expected as growth in the world's biggest economies start to slow.

Here are some of the job cuts by major American companies announced in recent weeks:

Technology, media and telecom companies:

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O):

The e-commerce giant said company-wide layoffs would impact over 18,000 employees.

Meta Platforms Inc (META.O):

The Facebook-parent said it would cut 13% of its workforce, or more than 11,000 employees, as it grapples with a weak advertising market and mounting costs.

Intel Corp (INTC.O):

CEO Pat Gelsinger told Reuters ""people actions"" would be part of a cost-reduction plan. The chipmaker said it would reduce costs by $3 billion in 2023. read more

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O):

The software giant laid off under 1,000 employees across several divisions in October, Axios reported, citing a source.

Twitter Inc:

The social media company has aggressively cut its workforce across teams ranging from communications and content curation to product and engineering following Elon Musk's $44 billion takeover.

Lyft Inc (LYFT.O):

The ride-hailing firm said it would lay off 13% of its workforce, or about 683 employees, after it already cut 60 jobs earlier this year and froze hiring in September.

Salesforce Inc (CRM.N)

The software company said it would lay off about 10% of its employees and close some offices as a part of its restructuring plan, citing a challenging economy.

Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O):

The networking and collaboration solutions company said it will undertake restructuring which could impact roughly 5% of its workforce. The effort will begin in the second quarter of the fiscal year 2023 and cost the company $600 million.

HP Inc (HPQ.N):

The computing devices maker said it expected to cut up to 6,000 jobs by the end of fiscal 2025.

Financial firms:

Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N):

The premier Wall Street investment bank will start cutting thousands of jobs across the firm, two sources familiar with the move have told Reuters, as it prepares for a tough economic environment in the year ahead.

The job cuts are expected to be just over 3,000, one of the sources said, in what would be the biggest workforce reduction for the bank since the 2008 financial crisis.

Morgan Stanley (MS.N):

The Wall Street powerhouse is expected to start a fresh round of layoffs globally in the coming weeks, Reuters reported on Nov. 3, as dealmaking business takes a hit.

Citigroup Inc (C.N):

The bank eliminated dozens of jobs across its investment banking division, as a dealmaking slump continues to weigh on Wall Street's biggest banks, Bloomberg News reported.

Genesis:

The cryptocurrency firm has cut 30% of its workforce in a second round of layoffs in less than six months, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Coinbase Global (COIN.O):

The cryptocurrency exchange said it would slash nearly 950 jobs, the third round of workforce reduction in less than a year after cryptocurrencies, already squeezed by rising interest rates, came under renewed pressure following the collapse of major exchange FTX. read more

Stripe Inc:

The digital payments firm is cutting its headcount by about 14% and will have about 7,000 employees after the layoffs, according to an email to employees from the company's founders.

Consumer and retail companies:

Beyond Meat Inc (BYND.O):

The vegan meat maker said it plans to cut 200 jobs this year, with the layoffs expected to save about $39 million.

Blue Apron Holdings Inc (APRN.N):

The online meal-kit company said it will cut about 10% of its corporate workforce, as it looks to reduce costs and streamline operations. The company had about 1,657 full-time employees, as of Sept. 30.

DoorDash Inc (DASH.N):

The food delivery firm, which enjoyed a growth surge during the pandemic, said it was reducing its corporate headcount by about 1,250 employees.

Energy and resources firms:

Phillips 66 (PSX.N):

The refiner reduced employee headcount by over 1,100 as it seeks to meet its 2022 cost savings target of $500 million. The reductions were communicated to employees in late October.

Health and pharmaceutical companies:

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N):

The pharmaceutical giant has said it might cut some jobs amid inflationary pressure and a strong dollar, with CFO Joseph Wolk saying the healthcare conglomerate is looking at ""right sizing"" itself.

LONDON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Investors took advantage of a wipeout in U.S. tech stocks this week to snap up equities, even though this sector is one of the most vulnerable as major central banks keep hiking rates, Bank of America Global Research said on Friday.

Equity funds recorded their largest weekly inflow since March in the week to Wednesday, at $22.9 billion. The largest share went into tech stocks, which saw inflows of $2.3 billion into tech equities, the biggest weekly inflow since March 2022.

Tech stocks have all but wiped out their gains from the pandemic in 2020, which saw the sector hit a record high valuations and boast some of the world's biggest companies.

But high inflation, rising interest rates and post-COVID economic activity has taken a lot of the wind out of the markets, with overvalued tech stocks and government bonds paying the biggest price.

The value of mega-cap tech companies has plunged a collective $4 trillion in 2022, according to BofA.

As the Federal Reserve and other central banks jack up rates, U.S. Treasuries, for example, are on course for their worst annualised returns in nearly 250 years, BofA said.

""243 rates hikes thus far in 2022 - that's one rate hike every trading day, the bond market is now pivoting from inflation to recession,"" the bank's analysts said in a note.

This week has seen steep drops in the market value of Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), which sank 25% after its most recent earnings. An index of New York-listed tech stocks is heading for a third monthly loss in October. (.NYFANG)

Even though the outlook for bonds is dark, inflows into corporate bonds resumed for the first time in at least eight weeks, according to the report. Investment grade debt saw inflows of $0.8 billion, while high-yield funds registered inflows of $2.1 billion.

But this renewed appetite for fixed income may not last, the bank said.

""While bonds pivoting from inflation to recession is a positive, a 'recession shock' could send credit spreads to new highs and stocks to new lows in the first quarter of 2023,"" BofA said.

Indeed, BofA said its bull and bear indicator remains at ""max bearish"" for the sixth consecutive week.

Emerging markets equity funds recorded their largest weekly inflow since April 2022 at $2.8 billion, in spite of a huge sell-off in China that sent mainland blue chips to their lowest in over two years and Hong Kong-listed shares to their weakest since early 2009.

Highlighting the ongoing risk aversion, investors ploughed $28.4 billion into cash, while bonds overall saw their first inflow in ten weeks of $1.4 billion and gold posted outflows of $0.5 billion.

BRUSSELS, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The European Union risks missing its target to connect all European households to a gigabit network by 2030, underscoring the need for more investments, according to a study commissioned by telecoms lobbying group ETNO.

The study by Analysys Mason comes as the bloc considers the possibility of getting Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O), Meta (META.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Netflix (NFLX.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) to bear some of the network costs.

Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), Orange (ORAN.PA), Telefonica (TEF.MC), Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) and their peers say this should be seen as a fair share contribution from the six content providers which account for more than half of data internet traffic.

Big Tech sees it as an internet traffic tax at odds with EU net neutrality rules treating all users equally, saying that they also invest in their own content delivery networks.

Total telecom investment in Europe peaked at 56.3 billion euros in 2021, the highest since 2016, but still lagged behind other regions, the report said.

""Europe continues to trail its peers worldwide in terms of telecoms investment. Investment per capita adjusted to GDP was 104 euros in Europe in 2021 compared with 260 euros in Japan, 150 euros in the United States and 110 euros in China,"" the study said.

""More investment capacity is needed to accelerate innovation, but the established current trends place additional pressure on many operators to sell or separate service and innovation-related assets,"" it said.

The study also noted the large gap between the returns on investment for telecoms operators and those for Big Tech.

""There is an acute discrepancy between the returns on investment in European telecoms infrastructure and the returns on investment of the largest services that run over this infrastructure,"" it said.

""When it comes to internet access, it is telecoms operators that shoulder the investment burden, while in terms of new value creation it is tech companies that benefit the most.""

July 21 (Reuters) - Snap Inc (SNAP.N) on Thursday painted a grim picture of the effects of a weakening economy on social media and declined to make a forecast in ""incredibly challenging"" conditions, sending its shares down 25% and setting off a chain reaction of stocks among rivals. read more

The Snapchat owner said some advertisers continue to face supply-chain disruptions and labor shortages, and many others are contending with rising costs amid record inflation, which has led to cutbacks in spending on advertising.

The Santa Monica, California-based company said it will significantly slow hiring, invest in its advertising business and find new sources of revenue in order to grow at a faster pace.

Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc , Google owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and other companies that sell online ads lost about $80 billion in combined stock market value on Thursday after the results by Snap, which was the first of the major tech firms to report second-quarter earnings. Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) will report results on Friday.

Investors are expecting the slowest-ever pace of growth for social media ad revenue this year, as rising inflation and other economic woes cause brands to slash their marketing budgets. read more

Snap's revenue for the second quarter ended June 30 was $1.11 billion, missing analyst expectations of $1.14 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The figure grew 13% from the prior-year quarter.

Snap said revenue so far in the current third quarter is flat compared with the prior year.

""We are not satisfied with the results we are delivering, regardless of the current headwinds,"" Snap said in prepared remarks released ahead of a conference call with analysts.

Recent privacy changes on iPhones, macroeconomic challenges and increasing competition for a pool of advertising dollars that is growing more slowly all contributed to ""substantially slowed"" revenue growth, Snap said.

Daily active users on Snapchat rose 18% year-over-year to 347 million, beating consensus estimates of 344 million users.

Snap has been investing heavily in augmented reality technology and ads, which overlays computerized images onto photos and videos of the real world.

But these newer forms of advertising tend ""to go first whenever marketing budgets are cut,"" said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence.

The company on Thursday also announced a share repurchase program of up to $500 million.

Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel and Chief Technology Officer Bobby Murphy have agreed to serve in their roles through at least Jan. 1, 2027, for a $1 salary and no equity compensation, the company said.

A look at the day ahead in markets from Sujata Rao

The bad news doesn't stop. Russia has upped the ante on European gas buyers, halting flows to Poland and Bulgaria for failing to pay in roubles. If expanded to Germany and elsewhere, energy rationing, factory stoppages and an economic growth hit await.

Then, markets have been jolted by big falls on Wall Street where results from Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) underwhelmed, sending its shares 6.5% lower, even after the board authorised another $70 billion in buybacks.

Tesla's 12% plunge -- $126 billion in market cap -- meanwhile may raise questions on whether boss Elon Musk will actually be able to acquire Twitter.

Still, while the 4% Nasdaq slump on Tuesday sent Asian markets in the red, U.S. and European futures are attempting to claw back some losses.

But earnings season, while still beating forecasts, highlights how much pressure companies are under -- from higher costs as well as consumers' starting to tighten their belts.

684,META,2022-08-16,Amazon criticizes 'burdensome' FTC probe into Prime,"













WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) confirmed that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been investigating sign-up and cancellation processes for its Prime program since March 2021

The probe was previously reported by Business Insider, but Amazon made the probe public in a recently posted petition with the FTC that questioned what it called the agency's ""burdensome"" requests and said the commission was harassing senior executives.

In an Aug. 5 filing, Amazon said the commission first sent a investigative demand for information in March 2021 in the Prime probe and in June expanded its requests for additional non-Prime subscription programs including Audible, Amazon Music, Kindle Unlimited and Subscribe & Save. Amazon says the expanded requests for information are ""overly broad and burdensome.""

The FTC probe has looked at steps customers must take to cancel or enroll in Prime.

Amazon said it produced 37,000 pages of documents and ""repeatedly met with staff to answer its questions.""

Amazon wants the FTC to extend the length of time allowed to respond to requests for comments and get a chance to respond to the FTC's ""new and expanded demands.""

An FTC spokesman declined to comment.

Amazon said the FTC was seeking to ""harass"" both its current chief executive Andy Jassy and former CEO and current executive chairman Jeff Bezos by demanding they testify at an investigative hearing ""on an open-ended list of topics.""

Amazon called that ""grossly unreasonable, unduly burdensome, and calculated to serve no other purpose than to harass Amazon’s highest-ranking executives and disrupt its business operations.""

The e-retailer said it learned in July that FTC staff had begun attempting to serve individual investigative demands ""at the homes of certain current and former Amazon employees.""

In a statement on Tuesday in response to the Prime probe, Amazon said: ""We make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up for or cancel their Prime membership.""

In February, Amazon raised the price of its Prime program. U.S. monthly fees for the fast-shipping and media service rose to $14.99 from $12.99, and annual membership went up to $139, from $119.

With more than 200 million members globally, Prime is an incentive to consumers to direct more of their shopping to Amazon. Revenue from such fees for the fourth quarter rose 15% to $8.1 billion.

The FTC is chaired by Lina Khan, who gained attention with a 2017 article in the Yale Law Journal titled ""Amazon's Antitrust Paradox."" The agency has opened a broad antitrust probe into Amazon as part of government antitrust investigations begun under the Trump administration.

685,META,2022-06-28,Large U.S. law firms begin to offer abortion travel benefits after Dobbs ruling,"Summary

Summary Law firms Firms like Akin Gump, Cozen O'Connor and McDermott will cover travel costs for attorneys seeking abortions















(Reuters) - Several large U.S. law firms have now promised to cover travel costs for employees seeking abortions after the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday overturned the constitutional right to the procedure.

Cozen O'Connor, Dorsey & Whitney, McDermott Will & Emery, Mayer Brown and Morgan Lewis & Bockius have told Reuters since Monday that they will foot travel costs for staff living in states where abortion is now restricted or banned.

Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld and Proskauer Rose also said they would offer the same benefit.

Reuters has reached out to over 60 large law firms since the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision was published Friday. The majority have not yet responded to requests for comment on whether they would implement an abortion travel policy.

Ropes & Gray and Morrison & Foerster on Friday were the first law firms to confirm to Reuters they had an abortion travel policy, as most initially stayed quiet on the issue.

Those two firms, as well as Mayer Brown, were part of the more than 30-firm group contacted by Reuters in the immediate aftermath of the Dobbs decision. The other seven firms that have since told Reuters they've created abortion travel policies were not part of that group.

Some of the law firms adopting these policies are among the largest by headcount in the country.

Morgan Lewis, which has nearly 2,000 lawyers, is the 10th biggest and Mayer Brown is No. 12 with over 1,700 lawyers, according to National Law Journal industry rankings.

The law firms join major U.S. corporations, like the Walt Disney Co and Meta Platforms that since Friday have said they would offer travel policies for staff who may no longer have abortion access in their home states.

Some big U.S. law firms, including O'Melveny & Myers and Jenner & Block, are already involved in litigation over states' abortion laws.

Jenner is representing Florida providers challenging a 15-week ban on the procedure, and O'Melveny is representing Kentucky abortion clinics and a healthcare provider in a lawsuit filed Monday challenging two state abortion bans.

Neither Jenner nor O'Melveny has responded to request for comment on whether they'd put abortion travel policies in place for staff.

686,META,2022-11-14,Squire Patton Boggs launches Dublin office as Irish legal market beckons,"













Nov 14 (Reuters) - Squire Patton Boggs on Monday said it will open an office in Dublin next year, becoming the latest international law firm to expand into Ireland.

The office will open May 1 and will be led by Dennis Agnew, the leader of international law firm Pinsent Masons' transactional team in Dublin. Agnew was a founding partner of Pinsent Masons' Dublin office.

A Squire Patton Boggs spokesperson said the firm is currently looking at space in Dublin's central business district.

Agnew will lead its recruiting efforts in Dublin, the firm said.

""In a post-Brexit world, Ireland continues to emerge as an important center for business activity spanning several key areas of our global practice, including private equity, tech and life sciences,"" global managing partner Steve Mahon said in a statement.

Agnew said in an email that the exact timing of his departure from Pinsent Masons ""has still to be agreed.""

John Cleland, the managing partner of Pinsent Masons, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Ireland's low corporate tax rate has helped draw large technology and drug companies to its shores. Large tech companies, including Meta Platforms Inc, Microsoft Corp's LinkedIn, and Workday Inc have expanded their respective footholds in Dublin in recent years.

Multinational companies employ around one in nine workers in Ireland; last year, the Irish government said the number of people employed by multinationals had hit an all-time high of 275,000 in 2021, up 10% on its pre-pandemic level.

International law firms have followed. Earlier this year, Armstrong Teasdale, a 370-lawyer firm founded in the Midwest, said it was opening a Dublin office. Two London-founded firms, Bird & Bird and Addleshaw Goddard, have also broken into the Irish market this year.

Detroit-founded Clark Hill, which opened a Dublin office in 2018, has twice merged with small local firms, most recently in January. Hogan Lovells and the UK arm of Littler Mendelson both opened offices there in 2021, while Dentons launched in Dublin in 2020.

Squire Patton Boggs was created in 2014 by the merger of Washington, D.C.-founded Patton Boggs and Cleveland-founded Squire Sanders. The firm boasts having more than 1,500 lawyers in more than 40 offices across the world. It is also among the top lobbying firms in Washington.

687,META,2022-09-07,"Partner pay watch: Covington's Stacey Grigsby, now a top White House lawyer","Summary

Summary Law firms Lawyer advised Meta, Uber

At White House, legal work focuses in part on abortion rights















(Reuters) - A former Covington & Burling partner now serving in the Biden White House counsel's office reported receiving more than $2.3 million in compensation since the start of 2021 for work advising Meta Platforms Inc, Uber Technologies Inc and other major U.S. companies, according to a newly disclosed ethics form.

Stacey Grigsby joined the Biden administration as a deputy counsel this summer from Covington, where she had been a partner in the commercial litigation group since early 2020. Grigsby previously was at Boies Schiller Flexner for six years.

At the White House, Grigsby focuses on reproductive rights and racial justice, among other matters.

Grigsby in July participated in a meeting of lawyers at the White House to discuss the protection of abortion rights, a key issue in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision a month earlier overturning the constitutional right to an abortion. Grigsby was among the White House officials who met in June with attorneys general of Michigan and Minnesota to weigh reproductive rights.

Financial disclosure reports are mandatory public ethics filings for many top U.S. officials, and they can offer a window into the pay at some of the country's largest law firms. The forms record income from the prior calendar year up to the date of the filing.

Grigsby did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.

Covington, with more than 1,100-attorneys, recorded $2.3 million in profits per equity partner last year, according to a report in March by The American Lawyer. The report said revenue per lawyer at the firm, which has its largest office in Washington, D.C., rose last year to $1.2 million.

Grigsby's disclosure showed a $50,000 ""separation payment"" from Covington that she said was based partly on her years of service at the firm.

Her other Covington clients included American Airlines Group Inc, Johnson & Johnson and Sony Music Publishing, according to the ethics form.

President Joe Biden at the start of his administration turned to firms including Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher; Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr; and Latham & Watkins to fill top legal posts. Grigsby earns $155,000 as a White House deputy counsel.

Former Gibson Dunn partner Stuart Delery is serving as the acting top White House lawyer since the departure of Dana Remus, who first held the post in the Biden administration.

688,META,2022-12-30,Product liability cases to watch in 2023,"













(Reuters) - Some of the most closely watched U.S. product liability cases, including mass torts over opioid painkillers and the heartburn medicine Zantac, began to wind down in 2022. Others, however, are just picking up steam. Below are some of the top product liability cases to watch in the coming year.

EARPLUGS AND TALC: THE 'TEXAS TWO-STEP'

Can companies avoid mass tort liability by unloading it into bankruptcy court? The strategy, known as the ""Texas two-step,"" drew attention in 2021, when Johnson & Johnson created a new subsidiary to take on claims that talc products caused cancer and placed it into bankruptcy. J&J has said that its talc products are safe.

3M Co followed suit in July, transferring liability a record-breaking mass tort over its military-issue earplugs to its subsidiary Aearo Technologies, the earplugs' original maker, which promptly filed for bankruptcy. (3M has disputed that the maneuver is a true Texas two-step, since it did not create a new subsidiary, but the effect is similar.)

A North Carolina bankruptcy judge blessed J&J's strategy, while an Indiana bankruptcy judge and a Florida district judge have both rejected 3M's. The cases are now being appealed, and the outcomes could signal whether the two-step will be a viable strategy in the future - or set up a split for the Supreme Court.

SOCIAL MEDIA AND TEEN MENTAL HEALTH

Product liability litigation so far has concerned physical products - industrial chemicals, drugs, medical devices, consumer goods. A recently consolidated multidistrict litigation takes aim at something less tangible: social media platforms.

Plaintiffs allege that Meta Platforms Inc's Instagram and Facebook, ByteDance Ltd's TikTok and other social media platforms lead to addiction and poor mental health outcomes in teens, including eating disorders, self-harm, depression and suicidal thoughts. They accuse the companies of deliberately using algorithms that encourage addiction despite knowing the consequences. A Meta spokesperson said that the company had numerous measures in place to protect teen users, including parental controls and a feature dedicated to reporting content that promotes eating disorders. TikTok did not reply to a request for comment.

The case will test whether the traditional product liability mass tort model can be extended to a radically new context - one in which the product is intangible, and plaintiffs' injuries are highly personal mental health problems. For now, the litigation is in its early stages but will heat up in 2023, as plaintiffs are expected to file a master complaint, and defendants their motions to dismiss, in the spring.

GUNS AS PUBLIC NUISANCE

Gun manufacturers and retailers are well protected from lawsuits seeking to hold them responsible for mass shootings, thanks to the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. The 2005 law says that companies cannot be sued over crimes committed with weapons that were sold legally.

Both plaintiffs and state lawmakers have explored ways to get around the law. One that has risen to prominence recently is the use of public nuisance theories. While public nuisance claims have been more traditionally used to force companies to pay to clean up damage to the environment, states including New York, New Jersey and Delaware have passed laws allowing gun makers to be sued for creating a public nuisance - for example, through reckless marketing or by failing to stop illegal trafficking.

The laws may soon be put to the test. A gunmaker association in May lost a challenge to New York's law, but that case remains on appeal. Meanwhile, manufacturers are suing to block the laws in New Jersey and Delaware. The outcomes of these cases could determine whether public nuisance poses a real threat to the gun industry.

ABBOTT INFANT FORMULA

Abbott Laboratories' recall last spring of infant formula made in its Sturgis, Michigan, factory after reports of serious bacterial infections in four babies made headlines and led to a nationwide formula shortage that has persisted all year. A U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspection found serious safety problems at the plant, which was finally allowed to reopen in July under an agreement with the agency.

The company may face significant legal fallout in the coming year. Plaintiffs' lawyers say a mass tort litigation consolidated in August could eventually include hundreds of personal injury claims and some wrongful death claims related to Similac, Alimentum and EleCare branded formula allegedly tainted with Cronobacter sakazakii bacteria, which can cause serious illness including meningitis, though as of Dec. 15 there were only 38 pending cases.

The litigation also includes class action claims on behalf of consumers whose children did not get sick but who say they paid a premium for Abbott's formula that they would not have paid if they knew it could be contaminated.

Abbott in December moved to dismiss the claims on multiple grounds, arguing that the plaintiffs failed to support their claims that it acted negligently, and that motion remains pending. The company has said there is no evidence its formula ever made any babies sick.

THE CASE THAT COULD EXTEND STATE COURTS' REACH

The U.S. Supreme Court in November heard arguments over whether states can require corporations to consent to the jurisdiction of their courts when they register to do business there - a case that could have potentially far-reaching impacts on product liability litigation.

The dispute arises from a petition by Virginia resident Robert Mallory, who asked the nation's top court to revive his lawsuit in Pennsylvania state court against his former employer, Virginia-based Norfolk Southern Railway Co, claiming he developed colon cancer because of asbestos exposure on the job. He says he can sue the railway in Pennsylvania because of a state law requiring any company that registers to do business there to consent to jurisdiction, regardless of where either party in the lawsuit is actually based.

The Supreme Court ruled in 2014 in Daimler AG v. Bauman that companies can be sued where they are ""at home."" Upholding jurisdiction based on Pennsylvania's law could open the door to lawsuits against large corporate defendants in Pennsylvania or other states with similar laws, including Georgia - another tool for the plaintiffs' bar to seek out favorable venues.

A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Anshuman Daga

The showman that he is, Tesla's Elon Musk entered Twitter's HQ on Wednesday carrying a sink, hours ahead of an end-of-week deadline to complete his $44 billion purchase of the social media giant.

But financial markets may do well to be wary of how far the spillover from a surprisingly small 50 basis points hike at the Bank of Canada sinks in.

The Fed remains the pace-setter for world rates, and the transmission from rates to the real economy is fuzzier in the United States than it is for Canada - or Australia for that matter. And markets remain priced for a 75 basis point Fed hike next week.

The European Central Bank is also almost certain to deliver its second supersized 75 basis-point rate hike and hint that the job is not yet over - though the size of subsequent moves is debatable.

The ECB joined the global rate hike party late. And with euro area inflation at nearly 10% versus its 2% target, there's little let-up in sight for the ECB despite rising recession risks.

The ECB decision is due at 1215 GMT followed by a news conference at 1245 GMT.

Markets are nevertheless building up optimism that the Fed and other central banks may start slowing the pace of rate hikes.

Hopes and hopeful dip buyers in Hong Kong pushed Asia's benchmark ex-Japan stocks gauge (.MIAPJ0000PUS) 1.3% higher and the mighty dollar is making a rare retreat.

The across-the-board gains in markets came despite U.S. stocks ending lower after a patch of disappointing earnings reports.

And in after-hours trading, shares of Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) plunged nearly 20% after the company forecast a weak holiday quarter and significantly more costs next year.

Thursday's advance estimate of third-quarter U.S. GDP will further set the tone for expectations of future interest rate hikes by the Fed.

For European stock investors, the focus will be on Credit Suisse Group's (CSGN.S) major strategic overhaul that is set to be unveiled on Thursday after the embattled Swiss bank's string of losses and risk management failures.

A look at the day ahead in markets from Sujata Rao

Much of the inflationary heat across the developed world has been generated by labour shortages. But of late, a raft of U.S. corporations -- Meta (META.O), Tesla (TSLA.O), Apple and Goldman Sachs among them -- have warned they will slow hiring.

The warnings tanked Wall Street by reinforcing -- alongside dismal housing data -- the picture of a cooling economy read more . Asian shares fell too, with China's rising coronavirus case load keeping alive fears of more activity curbs, and European markets are easing off one-month highs (.STOXX).

But hold on. Demand for workers is not abating just yet. Following on last month's robust U.S. payrolls, British figures on Tuesday revealed unemployment at 3.8% in the quarter to May. That bucked expectations for a slight rise. read more

Recent stock market gains were partly down to relief the U.S. Fed may not opt for a 100 basis-point rate hike in July. But policymakers elsewhere are not holding back on hawkish rhetoric.

While the UK jobs data reinforces the case for a 50 bps Bank of England rate increase next month; rate-setter Michael Saunders on Monday forecast rates -- currently 1.25% -- would reach or surpass 2% during the next year read more .

The Reserve Bank of Australia, meanwhile, reckons rates remain too low to contain inflation expectations. Current rates at 1.35% are too far below 'neutral', levels estimated between 2%-3%, it decided.

Especially so, given Aussie unemployment dived last month to a 48-year low of 3.5% read more .

The dialling back of more aggressive bets on Fed policy-tightening and the ratcheting up of rate hikes elsewhere lifted the Aussie dollar half a percent versus the greenback, while the pound is up 0.2% and the beleaguered euro too has managed a 0.2% gain.

Nowhere is the situation as perilous as the euro zone; news Gazprom has invoked force majeure on some gas supplies raises fears Russia will keep the Nord Stream 1 pipeline mothballed beyond July 21, when the link is due to open.

Jan 31 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in markets from Stephen Culp, New York stock market reporter.

Wall Street's downbeat start to an action-packed week has set a bumpy course for Asian markets on Tuesday.

U.S. stocks appeared to take a breather near the end of a month of solid gains, dipping into red as market participants gird their loins for multiple central bank policy decisions and a spate of high profile megacap earnings, with the Labor Department's hotly anticipated January employment report due on Friday.

The Federal Reserve convenes its two-day monetary policy meeting on Tuesday, which is expected to culminate on Wednesday with a bite-sized 25 basis point hike to the Fed funds target rate.

The Bank of England and the European Central Bank are poised to follow the Fed by hiking crucial interest rates by a more aggressive 50 basis points.

On the earnings front, Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), General Motors Co (GM.N), Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) are expected before Tuesday's opening bell.

Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) waits in the wings on Wednesday, with Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) on deck for Thursday.

Those earnings calls, along with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's post-rate-decision remarks, will be parsed and scrutinized by investors for clues regarding the likelihood, severity and timing of a potential recession.

Elsewhere, the U.S. dollar gained ground against a basket of world currencies, crude prices , plunged as the prospect of rate hikes and robust Russian exports dampened optimism over rebounding Chinese demand.

Speaking of which, the world's second-largest economy's fiscal revenue growth decelerated sharply in 2022 to 0.6% from 10.7% in 2021, largely due to Beijing's strict COVID-19 policies.

Those policies have since been relaxed, sparking hopes of demand revival in China, which could take some of the sting of restrictive central bank policy.

Here are some key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Tuesday:

- South Korea and Japan are expected to post December industrial output and retail sales data

- China due to release manufacturing and composite PMI reports for January

- U.S. will follow Case-Shiller home prices (November), consumer confidence (January) and Chicago PMI (January)

692,META,2022-11-21,India proposes guidelines to combat fake online reviews and ratings,"













NEW DELHI/BENGALURU, Nov 21 (Reuters) - India launched a crackdown on Monday against fake consumer reviews and unverified ratings in a bid to make the online world and e-commerce more authentic and less misleading for users.

The government has drafted guidelines for companies from Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, Meta Platform's (META.O) Facebook and Instagram, and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) to travel sites and food delivery apps that depend on reviews to validate products and services. Positive reviews help generate sales and interest from potential buyers.

Some companies have been criticised by consumers and industry experts for downplaying negative reviews, or accepting fake ratings, making the vetting process difficult for buyers.

The named companies did not immediately respond to a Reuters email seeking comment.

""Feedback mechanisms such as reviews are essential for consumer interest. We welcome the steps being taken by the government ... and are obliged to be a part of the constituted committee,"" said a spokesperson for Zomato.

The Department of Consumer Affairs set up a committee in June to develop a framework for checking fake and deceptive reviews in e-commerce, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution said.

""The new guidelines for online reviews are designed to drive increased transparency for both consumers and brands and promote information accuracy,"" said Sachin Taparia, founder of LocalCircles, a community platform and pollster which made the initial submission to the Department of Consumer Affairs and was part of the committee drafting the guidelines.

""As far as platforms like Google and Facebook go, the new rules will require them to validate the real person behind the review through specified 6-8 mechanisms which means fake accounts created just for review writing will go away over time or won't be able to review,"" said Taparia.

Full details of the proposal are not yet public.

""We do not want to bulldoze this. We will first see voluntary compliance of these guidelines. And if we see the menace continues to grow we may make this mandatory,"" Rohit Kumar Singh, secretary of the Department of Consumer Affairs, told reporters in New Delhi.

The Bureau of Indian Standards will assess compliance, the ministry said.

Online companies say they have internal checks in place to combat fake reviews, but currently failure to do so is not a compliance breach.

If the guidelines become mandatory, companies could face action for unfair trade practice, for suppressing negative reviews or for enabling planting of fake reviews, Taparia said.

693,META,2023-01-25,Microsoft's dour outlook raises red flags for tech sector,"













Jan 25 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) lackluster quarterly outlook points to more gloom ahead for the tech sector, analysts said, after the tech bellwether warned that its customers were cautious about spending in a turbulent economy.

The warning from Microsoft, the second most valuable U.S. company, came after a steep fall in client spending prompted tech heavyweights from Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) to Meta Platforms (META.O) to slash jobs and save cash.

Microsoft, along with Big Tech peers Amazon and Apple Inc , pared losses from earlier on Wednesday to trade nearly 1% lower. Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) was down 3%. The companies are four of the biggest by market value in the United States.

Shares of cloud companies including IBM Corp (IBM.N) and Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) all declined. IBM is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results later in the day.

Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella and other company executives used the words ""caution"" and ""cautious"" at least six times on the one-hour call on Tuesday.

""The rate of Microsoft's revenue slowdown should be seen as a warning sign for the wider tech sector,"" Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Sophie Lund-Yates said.

Analysts expect other tech executives to follow Nadella in laying out a conservative outlook.

""What we learned is that no one is immune to macro ... what is telling is the quarter was largely fine, but we started to see softness in December and the outlook for this quarter was worse than expected,"" said Rishi Jaluria, analyst at RBC.

Microsoft forecast third-quarter revenue in its so-called intelligent cloud business a tad below market estimates, with a growth rate of as much as 19%. The segment outperformed expectations in the second quarter, however, which initially boosted shares on Tuesday evening.

""That (the outlook) is taking the wind out of the sails,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.

Nadella, however, said Microsoft would focus on AI technology, calling it the next major wave of computing.

The tech giant has made multibillion dollar investments in OpenAI, deepening ties with the startup behind the chatbot sensation ChatGPT and building on a bet it made on AI four years ago.

With many tech companies now focusing on building their cash reserves, analysts expect the money to be used for other investments - from fresh buybacks, mergers and acquisitions or new technology such as artificial intelligence.

694,META,2022-04-26,Musk's pitch for free speech may turn Twitter advertisers jittery,"













April 26 (Reuters) - Advertisers could be reluctant to spend on Twitter (TWTR.N) if Elon Musk pushes ahead with plans to promote unfettered speech on the social media platform, analysts said, after the world's richest person clinched a deal to buy the company for $44 billion.

Although Musk, a self-proclaimed free speech absolutist, has not given details on how he plans to ""improve and fix"" Twitter, he has repeatedly called out the micro-blogging platform for not doing enough on free speech and criticized its content moderation policies. read more

Advertising is Twitter's main source of revenue, and analysts fear that unbridled free speech could spiral into misinformation and hate speech, potentially leading advertisers to dissociate themselves from the service.

Only about a 10th of the size of far larger social media platforms like Meta Platforms Inc's (FB.O) Facebook, Twitter has been credited with helping spawn the Arab Spring uprising and accused of playing a role in the storming of the U.S. Capitol.

""We expect advertisers will be less willing to spend on Twitter if Elon Musk removes content moderation in order to promote free speech,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson said.

If Musk makes good on his promises, advertisers on Twitter may shift to platforms like Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Youtube, TikTok or other channels to build brand awareness, Nathanson said.

Musk, who has amassed more than 80 million followers since joining Twitter in 2009, has himself used the platform to make several announcements, including the one in 2018 about taking Tesla private that landed him in regulatory crosshairs. read more

The 16-year old company, which has over 200 million users, reported $4.51 billion in ad revenue for 2021, accounting for about 89% of its overall sales.

""The challenge (for Twitter) will be maintaining and building revenue given that the controversial opinions (Musk) hopes to give more of a free rein to are often unpalatable to advertisers,"" Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter said.

Musk has also hinted at a subscription-based business model. But that could move ad spending towards smaller players like Pinterest (PINS.N) and Snapchat (SNAP.N), analysts at MKM Partners said.

""We believe there will be significant ripple effects across the entire online advertising ecosystem as Twitter goes through this 'go private' process over the next several months,"" they said.

The deal has been approved by Twitter's board and is unlikely to face any regulatory hurdles, according to analysts.

Twitter shares were down 1.7% at $50.85 in morning trading, still shy of Musk's offer of $54.20 per share.

695,META,2023-01-04,"Salesforce to cut 10% of workforce after hiring ""too many people""","













Jan 4 (Reuters) - Salesforce Inc (CRM.N) said it plans to cut jobs by 10% and close some offices, after rapid pandemic hiring left it with a bloated workforce amid an economic slowdown.

The cloud-based software firm said on Wednesday the job cuts would lead to about $1.4 billion to $2.1 billion in charges, while only about $800 million to $1 billion will be recorded in the fourth quarter.

Companies from Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) to Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) have slashed thousands of jobs in the past year, in preparation for a recession, expected as a result of aggressive interest rate hikes by global central banks to curb inflation.

Businesses that relied on cloud services during the pandemic are now trying to reduce expenses and are delaying new projects, hurting companies such as Salesforce and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

""The environment remains challenging and our customers are taking a more measured approach to their purchasing decisions,"" Salesforce co-Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff said in a letter to employees.

""As our revenue accelerated through the pandemic, we hired too many people leading into this economic downturn we're now facing, and I take responsibility for that.""

Salesforce had nearly 80,000 employees at the end of the third quarter, up from about 70,000 a year earlier.

The company said in its quarterly regulatory filing that it increased headcount ""to meet the higher demand for services"".

Salesforce shares were up 3% on Wednesday. They lost roughly half their value in 2022 as Salesforce posted four consecutive quarters of slowing growth.

The company lost about $175 billion in market value since its peak in November 2021

""It (the company) is certainly not alone as the sector has grappled with a demand environment that has meaningfully softened over the last 12 months,"" William Blair analyst Arjun Bhatia said.

The move puts Salesforce in a good position to meet its 2026 target of 25% operating margin but the macro backdrop could pose risk to its $50 billion revenue target, Bhatia said.

""There is high likelihood of right-sizing by other software firms,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria said.

696,META,2022-12-13,"USA-EU data transfer pact nears, EU says safeguards strong enough","













BRUSSELS, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The European Union on Tuesday took a step closer to sealing a data transfer pact with the United States as it issued a draft decision saying U.S. safeguards against American intelligence activities were strong enough to address EU concerns.

Both sides clinched a preliminary deal in March, cheering thousands of companies which found themselves in a legal morass after Europe's top court struck down a previous data transfer accord in 2020 on concerns about U.S. intelligence agencies accessing Europeans' data. It was the second such court veto.

U.S. President Joe Biden followed up in October with an executive order setting out new safeguards on the activities of U.S. intelligence gathering and creating a two-step system of redress, first to an intelligence agency watchdog then to a court with independent judges.

The European Commission's justice chief Didier Reynders said the draft adequacy decision shows that U.S. safeguards offer the same level of data protection to EU citizens as that under European law.

""Our analysis has showed that strong safeguards are now in place in the U.S. to allow the safe transfers of personal data between the two sides of the Atlantic,"" Reynders said in a statement.

""The future Framework will help protect the citizens' privacy, while providing legal certainty for businesses,"" he said.

Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems, whose campaign about the risk of U.S. intelligence agencies accessing Europeans' data in a long-running dispute with Meta led to the court vetoes, said the U.S. safeguards were not adequate for people outside the United States.

""I can't see how this would survive a challenge before the Court of Justice. It seems that the European Commission just issues similar decisions over and over again - in flagrant breach of our fundamental rights,"" he said in a statement.

Still, companies would be wise to have a fallback clause in the form of standard contract clauses in case the latest data transfer pact is challenged and rejected in court, said Patrick Van Eecke, head of law firm Cooley's European cyber, data and privacy practice.

""It is like putting the Concorde in the air again to New York: it is fast, smooth and easy for transporting people back and forth from Europe to the United States,"" he said.

""But you never know if it will be flying next year. So, use it when it is available, but make sure you have an alternative option which is air-ready if and when Concorde stops flying again.""

EU data protection watchdog EDPB, EU countries and EU lawmakers will now offer non-binding opinions in a process that will likely take about six months, with the EU final adequacy decision expected before next summer.

Feb 24 (Reuters) - A Colombian court this month hosted its first legal trial in the metaverse, and now hopes to experiment again with virtual reality, authorities told Reuters.

At the two-hour hearing held by Colombia's Magdalena Administrative court, participants in a traffic dispute appeared as avatars in a virtual courtroom. Magistrate Maria Quinones Triana's avatar dressed in black legal robes.

The country is among the earliest worldwide to test real legal hearings in the metaverse, immersive virtual reality to make digital spaces feel more lifelike, often with avatars representing each participant.

""It felt more real than a video call,"" Quiones told Reuters on Friday, describing the metaverse experience as ""amazing."" On Zoom, she noted, ""Many people turn off their cameras, you have no idea what they're doing,""

The case - brought by a regional transport union against the police - will now proceed partly in the metaverse, potentially including the verdict, Quiones said. She did not rule out metaverse hearings elsewhere.

""This is an academic experiment to show that there it's possible... but where everyone consents to it, (my court) can continue to do things in the metaverse,"" she added.

While legal trials have increasingly moved to video meetings hosted by Zoom and Google, few have experimented with the metaverse, a space that Meta (META.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and other tech giants are racing to build.

Early examples of interviews and meetings in the metaverse have been mocked for often-clunky, cartoonish visualizations.

Nonetheless, Colombia's court proceedings on Feb 15 - streamed to Youtube - went off without too much of a glitch, bar some dizzying camera movement and some distorted movements.

QUESTION MARKS

Quiones reiterated the constitutional legitimacy of the virtual tribunal, but acknowledged that the experiment had not been popular, citing 70% disapproval among viewers.

Juan David Gutierrez, a public policy professor at Colombia's University of Rosario, said use of the metaverse in legal proceedings has a long way to go.

""You need a hardware to do this that very few people have. And that prompts questions about accessibility to justice and equality,"" he told Reuters.

Quiones agreed that costs and accessibility needed to be discussed. But she advocated for the metaverse in cases of abuse for example, where participants can share a space without having to physically see each other.

Gutierrez said judges in Colombia were chasing ways to alleviate the country's overloaded justice system.

""We create this illusion that technology is going to make things more efficient, but sometimes, it's the opposite.""

698,META,2022-12-15,"Australia takes aim at Apple, Microsoft over child protection online","













SYDNEY, Dec 15 (Reuters) - An Australian regulator, after using new powers to make the tech giants share information about their methods, accused Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) not doing enough to stop child exploitation content on their platforms.

The e-Safety Commissioner, an office set up to protect internet users, said that after sending legal demands for information to some of the world's biggest internet firms, the responses showed Apple and Microsoft did not proactively screen for child abuse material in their storage services, iCloud and OneDrive.

The two firms also confirmed they did not use any technology to detect live-streaming of child sexual abuse on video services Skype and Microsoft Teams, which are owned by Microsoft, and FaceTime, which is owned by Apple, the commissioner said in a report published on Thursday.

A Microsoft spokesperson said the company was committed to combatting proliferation of abuse material but ""as threats to children's safety continue to evolve and bad actors become more sophisticated in their tactics, we continue to challenge ourselves to adapt our response"".

Apple was not immediately available for comment.

The disclosure confirms gaps in the child protection measures of some of the world's biggest tech firms, building public pressure on them to do more, according to the commissioner. Meta Platforms Inc, (META.O) which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, and Snapchat owner Snap Inc (SNAP.N) also got demands for information.

The responses overall were ""alarming"" and raised concerns of ""clearly inadequate and inconsistent use of widely available technology to detect child abuse material and grooming"", commissioner Julie Inman Grant said in a statement.

Microsoft and Apple ""do not even attempt to proactively detect previously confirmed child abuse material"" on their storage services, although a Microsoft-developed detection product is used by law enforcement agencies.

An Apple announcement a week ago that it would stop scanning iCloud accounts for child abuse, following pressure from privacy advocates, was ""a major step backwards from their responsibilities to help keep children safe"" Inman Grant said.

The failure of both firms to detect live-streamed abuse amounted to ""some of the biggest and richest technology companies in the world turning a blind eye and failing to take appropriate steps to protect the most vulnerable from the most predatory"", she added.

699,META,2022-06-10,New study estimates 1.6 million in U.S. identify as transgender,"[1/2] A person holds up a flag during rally to protest the Trump administration's reported transgender proposal to narrow the definition of gender to male or female at birth, at City Hall in New York City, U.S., October 24, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo















June 10 (Reuters) - A study published on Friday estimates that nearly 1.64 million people over the age of 13 in the United States identify themselves as transgender, based on an analysis of newly expanded federal health surveys.

The study estimates that about 0.5% of all U.S. adults, some 1.3 million people, and about 1.4%, or 300,000, of youth between 13- and 17-years-old identify as transgender, having a different gender identity than the sex they were assigned at birth.

The analysis was done by researchers at the Williams Institute, a think tank at UCLA's Law School focused on gender identity public policy, and concluded that the percentage and number of adults who identify as transgender had ""remained steady"" since the institute last made estimates in reports in 2016 and 2017.

""This report shows trans people live everywhere and their needs and concerns need to be listened to and be addressed in the public policy landscape,"" Jody L. Herman, one of the study's authors, said in an interview.

The researchers used data collected between 2017 and 2020 from two different kinds of surveys done by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC).

Jae Sevelius, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the study, called it the best population estimate yet using ""the best available data that we have currently to make these estimates.""

""That being said, even the best available data is not great,"" Sevelius said, adding that the findings of the new study, which was not peer-reviewed, aligns with earlier estimates.

Sevelius and a colleague conducted a peer-reviewed meta-analysis published in 2017 in the American Journal of Public Health that found nearly 1 million U.S. adults were transgender, based on more limited data than in the Williams Institute study. They called it a conservative estimate and concluded in their paper that future surveys would likely find higher numbers of transgender people.

The Williams Institute researchers and Sevelius noted the CDC data has limitations. For example, in 2017 the CDC introduced an optional set of questions about gender identity in its Youth Risk Behavior Survey for high school students, but only 15 states have used those questions, the Williams Institute study said.

Also, the language used in some survey questions is not ideal, Sevelius said: For example, some CDC questions ask transgender respondents if they consider themselves ""male-to-female"" or ""female-to-male,"" terminology some trans people reject.

""It's using a very crude tool to measure something that's extremely nuanced, especially for youth,"" Sevelius said.

700,META,2023-01-03,Apple's stock market value falls below $2 trillion,"













Jan 3 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) stock market value shrank sharply on Tuesday following its steep drop last year, leaving it below $2 trillion for the first time since March 2021.

The sell-off came a year after the iPhone maker became the first company to reach the $3 trillion market capitalization milestone.

Apple's shares declined 3.7% to $125.07 after Exane BNP Paribas analyst Jerome Ramel downgraded the company to ""neutral"" from ""outperform,"" slashing his price target to $140 from $180, according to Refinitiv Eikon.

Also exacerbating investors' worries that a slowing global economy and high inflation may be hurting demand for Apple devices, Nikkei reported, citing unnamed suppliers, that Apple has told suppliers to manufacture fewer parts for its ear buds, watches and laptops.

The drop in Apple's share price put its market capitalization at $1.99 trillion.

Ramel cut his iPhone shipment targets for fiscal 2023 to 224 million units from 245 million units, reflecting supply chain issues from manufacturer Foxconn and consumers cutting back spending on high-end phones.

At Apple's current stock price, the company's value is just ahead of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), valued at about $1.8 trillion.

Big Tech loses weight in S&P 500

With investors worried about consumer demand, analysts on average expect the Cupertino, California company to report a 1% drop in December-quarter revenue in the coming weeks, according to Refinitiv. That would mark Apple's first quarterly revenue decline since the March quarter of 2019.

""They (Apple) tend to skew to the high-end consumer device customer but even that demographic might be being affected by the high price of everything,"" Bokeh Capital Partners' Kim Forrest said.

Last year's steep sell-off on Wall Street punished tech-related heavyweights as investors worried about rising interest rates dumped stocks with high valuations.

The combined stock market value of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O) now accounts for about 18% of the S&P 500, down from as much as 24% in 2020.

Apple vs the S&P 500 since the iPhone's introduction

Even after its 27% drop last year, Apple has provided stellar returns to long-term shareholders. Investors who bought and held Apple shares when cofounder Steve Jobs launched the iPhone in 2007 have enjoyed a gain of over 4,000%, not including dividends, compared to a 180% gain in the S&P 500 over the same period.

701,META,2022-07-15,"Deforestation in Colombia edges up, moving further from government target","













BOGOTA, July 15 (Reuters) - Deforestation in Colombia edged up for the second year in a row in 2021, rising 1.5% versus 2020 levels, the environment ministry said on Friday, as environmentalists warned of the impact of a high number of fires this year.

In 2021, 174,103 hectares (430,218 acres) of forest were destroyed, the ministry said in a statement.

Though no comparative figure was given on Friday, the ministry last year said 171,685 hectares had been destroyed in 2020.

The increase on-year takes the government further away from its target of reducing the rate by 30%.

Despite the slight increase, the ministry celebrated what it called a reduction in deforestation growth trends.

""Concerning the goal of the National Development Plan, which proposes cutting the growth trend of deforestation by 30% by 2021, the figures found that, on average, this phenomenon was reduced by 34%,"" the ministry said.

The use of the hypothetical trend measurement - which the ministry said was based on modeling by the meteorological agency - instead of a reduction figure appeared at odds with previous goals and promoted criticism from environmentalists.

Colombia's President Ivan Duque has repeatedly pledged to cut deforestation in half by the end of his term next month, while Environment Minister Carlos Correa promised a reduction of 30% in deforestation by 2022 in a Reuters interview last year.

The reduction target was based on 219,552 hectares destroyed in 2017, after a peace deal with the now-demobilized FARC guerrillas opened swathes of forests - including in the Amazon - to deforestation.

The ministry did not immediately respond to requests to clarify either why it referenced rate of growth in the latest figures, instead of an overall reduction.

""This is ridiculous, it's unforgivable,"" Rodrigo Botero, director of the Foundation for Conservation and Sustainable Development (FCDS), told Reuters about the use of the trend measurement instead of a reduction figure.

Just under 80% of deforestation occurred in six provinces, including Meta, Caqueta, Guaviare and Putumayo, which count Amazon rainforest in their territory, the ministry said, though it did not offer a specific Amazonian deforestation figure.

The FCDS reported separately on Friday that 113,572 hectares (280,643 acres) of Colombia's Amazon was deforested between April 2021 and March 2022.

Compared with previous periods, the first six weeks of this year saw the highest number of fires in a decade, FCDS said, citing a record 50,571 fire alerts in forests throughout the country.

Nationally 40,650 hectares (100,450 acres) of forest were destroyed between Jan. 1 and Feb. 15, 2022, it said.

Colombia is not the only country in the region where deforestation is trending upwards. Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon reached a record high in the first six months of this year, as an area five times the size of New York City was destroyed. read more

REUTERS/Steve Marcus/File Photo















May 5 (Reuters) - Tech and financial companies leading efforts to cut climate changing emissions are finding a new challenge from remote work: the CO2 spewing out of home offices.

A few companies have begun counting what happens when employees boot up computers at home, turn up gas furnaces and ignore the world's most energy-efficient corporate campuses. It turns out that home setups popularized by the pandemic are eroding some of the climate benefit of abandoned commutes.

""Emissions didn't go away,"" said Amanda von Almen, head of emissions reduction at Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N). ""They just shifted to another area.""

Half of 20 big companies Reuters spoke to, including Salesforce, have estimated emissions from home offices.

Six of those reported detailed figures, showing their half a million workers collectively emitted the equivalent of 134,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide in about the first year of the pandemic. read more That is equivalent to consuming 15 million gallons of gasoline or burning 67,000 tonnes of coal.

While there are benefits to the climate from millions of employees not commuting when they work from home, the findings underscore that remote work is not a simple solution to cutting corporate emissions.

""Remote working has not delivered the environmental benefits that some people expected,"" said Steve Sorrell, professor of energy policy at University of Sussex. ""But they should probably have paid more attention to the decades of work in this area that suggest that environmental impacts may be less than expected.""

Companies reported varying benefits from the recent shift to telework. Salesforce found remote work has cut emissions 29% per employee, while Boston-based fund manager Fidelity Investments Inc found that moving to mostly remote work wiped out 87% of its emissions cuts in 2020.

Facebook, now Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O), calculated that employees through commutes and remote work produced more than a tonne of CO2 per person in 2020, down from 2 tonnes the year before - when just commuting was counted.

However, half of those companies Reuters surveyed are not counting home office emissions, including tech and finance leaders Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N).

""We anticipated these emissions are small relative to our carbon footprint and we are still evolving our methodology,"" Apple said in explaining its decision.

And even companies estimating the output from homes are divided on what to do about it. To honor its pledge to operate on 100% renewable energy, Meta has bought enough renewable energy credits to match remote workers' use, but it is not offsetting home-office natural gas.

Salesforce and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google excluded home-office electricity from their 100% goals as they weigh different initiatives for home use. Both, though, buy carbon credits to offset estimated emissions from telework.

Climate experts say those solutions scratch the surface: After pouring billions of dollars into traditional offices decked with rooftop solar, bathed in natural lighting and equipped with water recycling, employers transitioning to hybrid work need clear plans to make every location just as green.

""If we are serious about meeting our targets, then the corporate world needs to take the lead and think about homes as areas of improvement,"" said Eleftheria Kontou, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

HOW MANY LIGHTBULBS DOES IT TAKE...

One roadblock to counting home office emissions is that there is no standard on how or what to count. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), trying to solve the problem itself, concluded that remote staff work eight hours a day using a laptop, two monitors and three lightbulbs.

Others including Salesforce have surveyed workers about their homes and energy bills, and many companies just look at typical residential usage in the regions where their workers reside.

But if heating a home office requires heating an entire house, how are emissions counted? And how to account for a headquarters office that is available but unused?

At least five research analyses studying remote work, including one from the International Energy Agency, have generally warned that emissions could rise as companies keep powering traditional offices to provide flexibility and some workers take on further, albeit less frequent, commutes.

""In a worst-case scenario a hybrid working future could...create a world where buildings and homes are used inefficiently with a transport system that is unable to respond to changing demand and potentially more cars on roads,"" U.K.-based consultancy Carbon Trust wrote in a 2021 report on remote work.

In the face of uncertainty over counting, outdoor retailer REI Co-op will wait for ""uniform industry standards"" before accounting for the 10% of its workforce that is remote or mobile, said Andrew Dempsey, senior manager for sustainability, and it is not alone.

The nonprofit clearinghouse CDP said that fewer than 200 of the 13,000 companies reporting environmental data to it last year mentioned remote work and included relevant emissions. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, the most common accounting tool, has offered guidance on counting telework since 2011 but it does not specify how to calculate those emissions.

Corporate climate adviser William Theisen, North American chief of Atos SE's (ATOS.PA) EcoAct, described the limited reporting as concerning.

""I don’t think avoiding it is the responsible way to go,"" he said. ""If everyone was waiting for crystal-clear standards on counting remote work emissions, nothing would happen.""

Summary Law firms Mayer Brown hires partner Dominique Shelton Leipzig in Los Angeles

She advises clients on data, advertising technology privacy, Internet of Things















(Reuters) - Privacy and cybersecurity lawyer Dominique Shelton Leipzig, who has advised technology giants Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp and Meta Platforms Inc, is taking her practice from Perkins Coie to Mayer Brown, the Chicago-founded law firm said on Monday.

Shelton Leipzig joins as a Los Angeles-based partner, where she will lead teams focused on global data innovation and advertising technology privacy and data management, as she did at Perkins Coie.

Shelton Leipzig said those will be teams within the firm's cybersecurity and data privacy practice, which is led by former U.S. National Security Agency general counsel Raj De.

""What drove the move [to Mayer Brown] is really the inflection point where we are with data right now, with it driving really everything that we do,"" including education, work, financial services and healthcare, she said.

Clients need help navigating the ever-growing amount of data, connected devices and points of possible attack, she said. Companies want to leverage data to be competitive and are also grappling with a ""minefield"" of data protection and security laws globally.

Those factors have also driven many other large law firms to bulk up their privacy and data security practice groups in recent years with both new partners and associates. In 2020 and into 2021, data privacy practice leaders swapped firms at a fast clip.

Shelton Leipzig also cited Mayer Brown's growth in Northern California, where she has technology clients, as a draw.

She advises clients on privacy and cybersecurity compliance, defends companies in government and regulatory investigations and conducts trainings for corporate boards, the firm said.

Shelton Leipzig also represented the California Chamber of Commerce in a negotiation with California privacy law architect Alastair Mactaggart and others on the California Privacy Rights Act, the firm said.

A Perkins Coie spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on her departure.

704,META,2022-03-23,"Behind Russia's 'digital iron curtain', tech workarounds thrive","Summary

Summary Companies Russia blocks numerous media outlets, social media sites

Demand for VPNs, encrypted messaging apps surges

Internet seen increasingly split along geopolitical lines















March 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - As a busy tour guide in St. Petersburg, Vsevolod Gavrilov never paid much attention to the day's headlines, instead tracking travel influencers on social media platforms and messaging his friends on the Telegram app.

But since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, the 37-year-old said he had been trying to find ""credible"" news sources due to Russian moves to block numerous global and local news sites, along with social media such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

""Most news sources are blocked, and those that are not blocked don't look credible. Telegram channels have become one of the few ways to find out information,"" said Gavrilov, who follows pro-Russia, Ukrainian and independent news channels.

Russian officials accuse the West of spreading false information about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and a Moscow court this week found Meta - the owner of Facebook and Instagram - guilty of ""extremist activity"".

But as Moscow tries to control the narrative about the conflict, which it calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarise Ukraine and purge it of what it sees as dangerous nationalists, some ordinary Russians are using tech to skirt the curbs.

""A week ago, I didn't know what a VPN was,"" Gavrilov said, referring to Virtual Private Networks that encrypt data and obscure where a user is located.

Reflecting a surge in demand for VPNs, which had already been rising due to increasing cyber attacks in the region, he said he now has three VPN apps on his phone ""because they are also getting blocked"".

Besides VPNs, Russians are using encrypted messaging apps, email and radio to communicate, access blocked websites, and get information.

Western technology experts have said the Russian actions amount to a ""digital iron curtain"" similar to China's great firewall, and raise the risk the internet could split along geopolitical lines, digitally isolating people in some nations.

""(The internet) was never designed to respect country borders,"" Andrew Sullivan, president and chief executive of Internet Society, a U.S.-based advocacy group said earlier this month.

""If we travel that path, in short order the network of networks will not exist.""

EFFECTIVE RESTRICTIONS

Russia banned several VPNs last year as part of a wider campaign that critics say curbs internet freedom, though it has failed to block them entirely.

But now, censorship and Western sanctions including restrictions on payment platforms are making it harder for Russians to install new apps or pay for them.

A petition calling for global VPN companies to provide Russians free access has garnered about 35,000 signatures.

Human rights campaigners have said unencrypted communications can lead to arrest or intimidation, especially for independent Russian journalists or critics of the invasion.

So some have taken to making their messages disappear, or regularly deleting messages and voice notes.

But VPNs and other circumvention tools cannot totally demolish firewalls, and are not always reliable, said Jathan Sadowski, a senior research fellow at Monash University's Emerging Technologies Research Lab.

""These services work to varying degrees, and their use can be quite uneven. So internet restrictions are still effective,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

While Russia's moves have raised fears of a so-called splinternet - with a number of national or regional networks that do not interconnect or that operate with incompatible technologies - they are only hastening a shift that was already underway, said Sadowski.

""This dynamic - which has also long been called the Balkanisation of the internet - reveals how geopolitics is a major force shaping the digital structure and material infrastructure of the internet,"" he said.

""In many ways, the splinternet is already here; it's just experienced differently, depending on who and where you are.""

SMUGGLED FLASH DRIVES

Governments worldwide are trying to control how tech companies operate, and are imposing restrictions on news flows with a slew of regulations, as well as firewalls, internet shutdowns and social media blocks.

China, Iran and Russia have long been adjusting private and decentralised networks to give authorities more control.

In countries such as Ethiopia, Venezuela, Iraq, India and Myanmar, social-media blocking and outages are common, while Cambodia is set to launch a national gateway similar to China's.

Global media outlets including the BBC and Deutsche Welle have published guidelines on how Russians can get around web blockades by using Tor, a software that routes internet traffic through a network of servers.

Several publications have also launched mirroring websites - or copies at new internet addresses, as well as channels on Telegram. The BBC has resumed shortwave broadcasts on frequencies that can be ""received clearly in Kyiv and parts of Russia"".

""Our apps have technology to circumvent censorship,"" Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) said on its website.

A group of international programmers known as Squad 303 - named after a British Royal Airforce Unit made up of Polish pilots in World War Two - is enabling anyone to send anti-Putin messages to Russian cell phones via text, WhatsApp or email.

Thomas Kent, a former president of RFE/RL, had other suggestions, including ""emailed audio, closed messaging groups on lesser-known social networks, smuggled flash drives, and transmission of digital material by radio or telephone"".

In St. Petersburg, several of the radio stations that 71-year-old pensioner Marina used to listen to have been shut down, and she is not comfortable using the internet, making it harder to access a range of news sources.

Her children send her news and video clips via WhatsApp, and she listens to a business FM radio station that also covers current affairs in Russia and around the world.

""It has more balanced coverage of events and less of the official agenda,"" said Marina, who asked that her last name not be used. ""I still watch TV, but I have less trust in the official news now.""

Law firms Related documents Privacy deal's terms too broad, antitrust plaintiffs said

Judge declined to add carve-out to settlement















Nov 14 - A California federal judge has given final approval to a $90 million settlement resolving consumer privacy claims against Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc, spurning an objection to the deal from plaintiffs' lawyers leading a parallel antitrust case against the social media platform.

San Jose-based U.S. District Judge Edward Davila in an order on Friday called the privacy settlement ""fair and reasonable,"" despite claims from a group of antitrust lawyers who said the broad sweep of settlement terms jeopardized their case.

Davila also upheld an award of about $26 million in legal fees over other objectors' challenge to the amount.

The antitrust plaintiffs' lawyers, Shana Scarlett of Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro and Stephen Swedlow of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, on Monday did not immediately reply to a message seeking comment.

A Facebook spokesperson did not immediately comment about whether the settlement might affect the antitrust case.

The privacy settlement wrapped up allegations that Facebook continued to track users' web activity despite being logged out of the site.

The antitrust lawsuit, pending before a different judge in California federal court, accused Facebook of exploiting its users' information to curb competitors.

Facebook denied the privacy claims, and the company is fighting the allegations in the antitrust case.

In the antitrust case, plaintiffs' lawyers at Hagens Berman and Quinn Emanuel Urquhart had asked Davila to include a sentence saying the resolution of the privacy settlement doesn't impact the antitrust litigation.

Davila sidestepped the issue, pointing to Facebook's silence on the matter. He said that ""because [Facebook] has not substantively responded to whether the action"" would be resolved by the privacy settlement terms, he declined to rule on the issue.

Davila's order noted that lawyers for Facebook, represented by Cooley, at the fairness hearing in the privacy case declined to say whether the settlement affected the antitrust litigation pending before U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco.

Lead counsel for the privacy class, David Straite of DiCello Levitt Gutzler and Stephen Grygiel of Grygiel Law, called Davila's ruling ""thoughtful"" and said an injunction in the case ""benefits all class members whether or not they also submitted a claim for a portion of the $90 million settlement fund.""

Davila rejected challenges to the legal fees as excessive in the privacy case and awarded, as requested, 29% of the settlement fund, or $26.1 million. Some objectors had asked the court to award no more than 20% for fees.

The case is In re Facebook Internet Tracking Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 5:12-md-02314.

For plaintiffs: David Straite of DiCello Levitt Gutzler; Stephen Grygiel of Grygiel Law; and Jay Barnes of Simmons Hanly Conroy

For Facebook: Michael Rhodes of Cooley

706,META,2023-01-23,"U.S. Supreme Court seeks Biden administration view on Florida, Texas social media laws","













Jan 23 - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday asked President Joe Biden's administration to weigh in on whether it should review Republican-backed laws in Texas and Florida that would undercut efforts by major social media companies to curb content deemed objectionable on their platforms, actions the states call impermissible censorship.

The justices are considering taking up two cases involving challenges to the state laws - both currently blocked - brought by technology industry groups NetChoice and the Computer & Communications Industry Association that count Twitter , Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) Facebook and Alphabet Inc's YouTube (GOOGL.O) as members.

Supporters of the laws have argued that social media platforms have silenced conservative voices while advocates for the judicious use of curbing content have argued for the need to stop misinformation and advocacy for extremist causes.

Florida is seeking to revive its law after a lower court ruled largely against it, while the industry groups are appealing a separate lower court decision upholding the Texas law, which the Supreme Court had blocked at an earlier stage of the case.

The cases would test the argument made by the industry groups that the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of free speech protects the right of social media platforms to editorial discretion and prohibits the government from forcing them to publish and disseminate content against their will, or disclose internal content moderation processes.

The companies have said that without editorial discretion their websites would be overrun with spam, bullying, extremism and hate speech.

The Republican states passed their laws in 2021 in response to a view articulated by many U.S. conservatives and right-wing commentators that large technology companies - sometimes called Big Tech - regularly suppress their views.

These people cite as an example Twitter's move to permanently suspend of Republican then-President Donald Trump from the platform in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of his supporters, with the company citing ""the risk of further incitement of violence.""

Florida's law requires platforms with at least 100 million users to ""host some speech that they might otherwise prefer not to host"" by disclosing censorship rules and applying them ""in a consistent manner among its users."" It also prohibits the banning of any political candidates.

The Texas law forbids social media companies with at least 50 million monthly active users from acting to ""censor"" users based on ""viewpoint.""

The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2022 upheld the Texas law, concluding that it ""chills no speech whatsoever. To the extent it chills anything, it chills censorship.""

The Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2022 rejected most of Florida's law but upheld the legality of the provisions requiring websites to make certain disclosures, including content moderation standards and rule changes.

707,META,2022-05-24,Airbnb to shut domestic business in China from July 30,"













HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, May 24 (Reuters) - Vacation rental company Airbnb Inc (ABNB.O) will shut down all listings and experiences in mainland China from July 30, it said on Tuesday, joining a long list of Western internet platforms that have opted out of the Chinese market.

The company made the announcement on its official WeChat account without elaborating on the reasons behind the decision. The San Francisco-based company said Chinese users would still be allowed to book listings and experiences abroad.

“We have made the difficult decision to refocus our efforts in China on outbound travel and suspend our homes and Experiences of Hosts in China, starting from July 30, 2022,” Airbnb co-founder Nathan Blecharczyk wrote.

The Global Times newspaper, citing a source close to the company, said Airbnb had decided to shut the domestic business because it was too costly and complex to operate, which had been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Airbnb did not respond to a request for comment.

The company joins a long line of Western internet companies, such as Linkedin and Yahoo, to have retreated from China in recent months in a sign of an internet decoupling of the world’s second-largest economy from much of the rest of the world.

Almost all major Western internet platforms, including Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google and Meta Platforms Inc’s (FB.O) Facebook, have ceased to provide services to end users in mainland China, citing reasons ranging from censorship to operational difficulties. read more

China's efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 has also led to business disruptions across the country, with several cities locked down, including the major economic hub of Shanghai.

CNBC first reported Airbnb’s decision earlier on Tuesday.

The New York Times reported that Airbnb would remove about 150,000 listings in China, out of six million it had around the world. Stays in China have accounted for roughly 1% of Airbnb’s business in recent years, the reports said.

Founded in 2008, Airbnb started providing services in mainland China in 2015. It had made efforts to localise its services, including integration with Chinese platforms such as Tencent Holdings’(0700.HK) WeChat. Its main Chinese rivals are Tujia, Xiaozhu and Meituan (3690.HK).

Meituan's vacation rental business Meituan Minsu said on Tuesday that it has formed a special team to help existing Airbnb hosts to put up listings on its platform. Tujia made a similar announcement earlier on the day.

Airbnb’s shares gained 0.7% in Monday trading on Nasdaq but have receded by 1.6% in post-market trading.

708,META,2023-02-01,Morning Bid: Riding the Fed dragon,"













Feb 2 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in markets from Stephen Culp, New York stock market reporter.

Asian markets are set for an upbeat Thursday as U.S. stocks whipsawed to a higher close after the Federal Reserve delivered an expected 25 basis point interest rate hike and warned it still expects 'ongoing increases' as it battles inflation.

All three major U.S. stock indexes reversed earlier losses to sail across the finish line in positive territory, under assurances from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell that he believes price growth can be tamed ""without a significant economic decline.""

In his remarks and Q&A session following the policy decision, Powell said ""there's more work to do,"" before its goals are met, but acknowledged data shows inflation is beginning to cool.

""The door is cracking open to end rate hikes, but they still have a chance for one more rate hike at the next meeting,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group in Omaha. ""Inflation data continues to show major improvements, which is exactly what the Fed needs to take their foot off the pedal.""

The European Central Bank and the Bank of England are expected to hike their key interest rates by 50 basis points on Thursday.

On the economic front, restrictive central bank policies appear to be dampening factory activity, with purchasing managers' indexes around the world either in contraction or struggling to expand.

Fourth-quarter earnings season is running on all cylinders, with 190 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported already. Of those, 69% have delivered consensus-beating profits, according to Refinitiv.

Shares of Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) jumped more than 18% in extended trading after the social media bellwether forecast first-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates, signaling a rebound in demand for digital ads after months of weak sales.

Healthcare companies BristolMeyers-Squibb Co (BMY.N), Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) and Merck & Co (MRK.N) are due to report before trading commences on Wall Street on Thursday, with the heavy-hitting triple play of Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) expected after the session ends.

Elsewhere, the U.S. dollar lost ground against a basket of world currencies, while crude prices , settled sharply lower due to a buildup of U.S. oil stocks.

709,META,2022-03-21,Australia to make Big Tech hand over misinformation data,"[1/4] Facebook, Google and Twitter logos are seen in this combination photo from Reuters files. REUTERS















SYDNEY, March 21 (Reuters) - Australia's media regulator will be able to force internet companies to share data about how they have handled misinformation and disinformation under new laws that will bolster government efforts to rein in Big Tech.

The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) will also be able to enforce an internet industry code on uncooperative platforms, the government said on Monday, joining others around the world seeking to reduce the spread of harmful falsehoods online.

The planned laws are a response to an ACMA investigation that found four-fifths of Australian adults had experienced misinformation about COVID-19 and 76% thought online platforms should do more to cut the amount of false and misleading content online.

The laws broadly align with efforts by Europe to curb damaging online content, which are due to take effect by the end of 2022, although the European Union has said it wants even tougher measures to stop disinformation given some of the output from Russian state-owned media during the invasion of Ukraine. read more

""Digital platforms must take responsibility for what is on their sites and take action when harmful or misleading content appears,"" Communications Minister Paul Fletcher said in a statement.

Australians were most likely to see misinformation on larger services like Meta Platforms's Facebook (FB.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), the ACMA said.

False narratives typically started with ""highly emotive and engaging posts within small online conspiracy groups"" and were ""amplified by international influencers, local public figures, and by coverage in the media"", it added.

The authority also noted that disinformation, which involves intentionally spreading false information to influence politics or sow discord, was continuing to target Australians. Facebook had removed four disinformation campaigns in Australia from 2019 to 2020, it said.

It said conspiracy groups often urged people to join smaller platforms with looser moderation policies, like Telegram. If those platforms rejected industry-set content guidelines ""they may present a higher risk to the Australian community"", the ACMA said.

The crackdown adds another element to the ruling conservative government's assertion that it has taken a big stick approach to tech giants, as it faces an election that is due by May that most polls suggest it will lose.

Fletcher said the new powers for the regulator would be introduced to parliament in late 2022, meaning it would likely be up to the current opposition Labor party to shepherd them through if the government loses the election.

A spokesperson for Labor's shadow communications minister, Michelle Rowland, told Reuters the opposition supported the expanded powers but the government had taken too long to introduce them since they were recommended in 2019.

DIGI, an Australian industry body representing Facebook, Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google, Twitter and video site TikTok, said it supported the recommendations and noted it had already set up a system to process complaints about misinformation.

Summary

Summary Companies ACCC alleges Airbnb misled customers about accommodation prices

Thousands of customers charged more than displayed prices

Airbnb to ""compensate affected guests""















June 8 (Reuters) - Australia's antitrust regulator has filed a lawsuit against Airbnb Inc (ABNB.O), accusing the accommodation-sharing website of misleading users into paying more than advertised for their stays, widening its scrutiny of global technology platforms.

From 2018 to 2021, the San Francisco-based internet giant advertised and charged room rates in U.S. dollars without indicating the much higher figures in Australian dollars, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said in a court filing on Wednesday.

Airbnb refused to refund users who complained about being misled, saying they had chosen to view rates in the USD even though users said they had not, the ACCC said in the filing, adding, the firm also refused to refund currency conversion fees, claiming they were banks' responsibility.

The Australian dollar bought an average of 72 U.S. cents during the time covered by the lawsuit, meaning a customer renting accommodation advertised at $500 would actually pay around A$700 plus foreign exchange fees, the regulator said.

""While a fraction of a percentage of guests are believed to have been impacted ... we will compensate affected guests,"" Susan Wheeldon, Airbnb's country manager - Australia and New Zealand, said in an emailed statement, but declined to offer further details.

Wheeldon said Airbnb has since updated its platform, so relevant currencies are ""clearly displayed"" from the first page for Australian guests.

In the lawsuit, the ACCC said Airbnb stood to benefit unfairly over competitors because the ""false and misleadingly low prices conveyed ... made the accommodation available on the platform appear to be more attractive.""

The regulator told Reuters in an emailed response while the court would determine any amount of penalty, the maximum fine per breach would be the number greater of A$10 million ($7.20 million), thrice the value of the benefit obtained, or 10% of the annual turnover made over the last year.

""However, we note this is only the maximum penalty per breach, and the ACCC may seek a higher amount if there are multiple breaches,"" it added.

The lawsuit puts Airbnb in the company of several high-profile targets of a regulator bent on reining in the power of big technology firms, including Meta Platforms Inc's (FB.O) Facebook and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google regarding content licensing fees.

It is currently conducting a review of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and other online retailers that may recommend changes to the sector. read more

BRUSSELS, Feb 27 (Reuters) - The Netherlands on Monday warned against hitting Big Tech with a so-called internet toll to help pay for billions of euros in network investments, saying such a move may breach net neutrality rules and lead to price hikes for Europeans.

The comments by Dutch Economic Affairs Minister Micky Adriaansens marked the first by an EU country after EU industry chief Thierry Breton kicked off a consultation last Thursday on who should foot the bill to roll out costly 5G and broadband.

Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), Orange (ORAN.PA), Telefonica (TEF.MC), Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) and other operators have long lobbied for a Big Tech contribution and have found an ally in Breton, a former chief executive at Orange.

Among the companies that said an internet tax would undermine EU rules to treat all users equally are Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). These companies account for more than half of data internet traffic, according to telecom operators.

Adriaansens said the Dutch government had commissioned a study by economic consultancy Oxera which showed the drawbacks of such a tax.

""It will penalise the consumers,"" she told Reuters in an interview, saying that consumers who pay subscription fees to telecoms providers and also subscribe to streaming and video services may see the latter fees go up with Big Tech likely to pass on the internet tax.

""We should analyse the problem first and what the normal market reaction is to these challenges. The first one is the government in place to facilitate or are there other funds available or is it just the markets' responsibility to take care of this infrastructure?"" Adriaansens said.

""I think that there is this concern that our infrastructure is not able to meet our expectations and our ambitions. So I understand that concern but I don't think that this is the way to go then, so fast,"" she said.

According to Oxera's study, Europe's telecoms providers have not been burdened with higher network costs despite the strong growth in internet data traffic. Oxera also found that these companies' operating profits have been boosted by network modernisation which has led to fewer employees and lower capital costs.

""Our analysis of the proposals for a levy shows that such a policy cannot robustly be shown to increase economic efficiency, and would potentially bring substantial transaction and set-up costs,"" the report said.

712,META,2023-02-27,EU industry chief Breton says not favouring Big Telecoms over Big Tech,"













BRUSSELS, Feb 27 (Reuters) - EU industry chief Thierry Breton on Monday defended a consultation on whether Big Tech should foot the bill for billions of euros of investments in Europe's telecoms infrastructure, saying it was not about putting Big Telecoms' interests above tech companies.

The consultation launched last week pits Deutsche Telekom AG (DTEGn.DE), Orange SA (ORAN.PA), Telefonica SA (TEF.MC), Telecom Italia SpA (TLIT.MI) against Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

The European Union official said he did not see the issue as ""a binary choice between those who provide networks today and those who feed them with the traffic"".

""For me the real challenge is to make sure that by 2030 our fellow citizens and business on our streets across the EU – including here in Barcelona – have access to fast, reliable and data-intense Gigabit connectivity,"" Breton said in the text of a speech to be delivered at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in the Spanish city.

""And for that we need the connectivity networks – highways – of the future. That is the vision. It is not about whether one vested interest should prevail over another,"" he said.

The Dutch government on Monday warned against imposing an internet toll on tech companies, the first EU government to criticise Breton's plan after its Thursday launch, saying such a move may breach net neutrality rules and lead to price hikes for Europeans.

Still, Breton took a swipe at the big U.S. tech companies with their large-scale data centres, their cloud-based radio access network (RAN) - the radio element of a cellular system - and their closed ecosystems.

""We see hyperscalers in cloud and platform services leveraging their market dominance to move into the telco space, using their cash reserves to develop Cloud RAN networks and to provide direct services to business,"" he said.

""And interoperability or openness are not currently a strong feature of their business model.""

He called for a serious discussion of possible hurdles to cross-border telecoms consolidation, siding with operators who say tough EU merger rules impede deals, and also talked up the benefits of an integrated radio spectrum market.

""I see these two issues as currently holding back our collective potential compared to other continents,"" Breton said.

713,META,2022-10-13,Exclusive: Google faces EU antitrust charges over its adtech business - sources,"













BRUSSELS, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google could face EU antitrust charges next year over its digital advertising business, putting the company at risk of its fourth fine in the EU of more than a billion euros, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.

Google's ad business, which generated over $100 billion in sales last year, is Alphabet's biggest moneymaker. It accounted for about 80% of annual revenue, despite efforts over the past decade to push into selling hardware, subscription services and cloud computing technology.

The European Commission launched an investigation into Google's adtech business in June last year, concerned that the U.S. tech giant may be getting an unfair advantage over rivals and advertisers.

The company, which risks its fourth billion-euro fine, subsequently sought to settle the case but concessions were minor and very preliminary, one of the people said. Google has racked up more than 8 billion euros ($7.7 billion) in EU antitrust fines in the last decade.

The EU competition enforcer is likely to issue the charges early next year although the timing may still change, one of the people said.

The Commission has asked third parties to delete confidential details in their submissions, usually a precursor to allowing Google to access documents following the receipt of a statement of objections, one of the people said.

Google could avert the charges by offering more concessions to settle the investigation. Some companies prefer to see the precise regulatory concerns before proposing remedies tailored to these.

The Commission declined to comment. Google, the world's leading seller of online advertising, well ahead of Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), had no immediate comment.

HEART OF GOOGLE'S BUSINESS MODEL

The case goes to the heart of Google's advertising-driven business model, affecting advertisers, publishers, ad tech providers and users alike, said Dieter Paemen, a partner at law firm Clifford Chance who has previously advised Google rivals in other cases.

""It's been a long time coming – advertisers and publishers have been up in arms about Google's ad-tech conduct for many years. Google is operating on multiple sides of the advertising transaction and giving both publishers and advertisers a raw deal,"" he said.

Google's dominance in online advertising has been increasingly questioned over the past few years. Complaints from rivals about its allegedly anti-competitive practices have led to antitrust investigations on five continents concerning its practices.

Google's ad business generated almost $111 billion in sales through the first half of the year. Analysts expect Google to generate $233 billion in ad sales this year, up about 11% from a year ago, according to Refinitiv estimates.

Google's ad business includes many parts, but search ads lead the way in terms of revenue. Other facets include selling ads on websites and apps of outside partners and selling ads on YouTube, Gmail and other in-house services.

714,META,2022-08-29,EXCLUSIVE Win for Qualcomm as no EU appeal court ruling against $991 mln fine - sources,"













BRUSSELS, Aug 29 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators will not appeal a court ruling scrapping its 997-million-euro ($991 million) fine against Qualcomm (QCOM.O), people familiar with the matter said, in a major win for the U.S. chipmaker that ends a long-running saga.

The Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second-highest, in its June judgment was scathing of the European Commission's handling of the case, saying procedural irregularities had affected Qualcomm's rights of defence. read more

Judges also invalidated the Commission's analysis that payments made by Qualcomm to Apple (AAPL.O) were anti-competitive because the regulator had not taken into account all the relevant facts.

It would be very difficult for the EU competition watchdog to win on both counts in an appeal, the people familiar with the matter said.

The judgment was a major setback for EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, who has handed out billion-euro fines to Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google and opened investigations into Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple and Facebook owner Meta (META.O) as part of her crackdown on Big Tech.

The European Commission, which can appeal to the EU Court of Justice (CJEU) on points of law, declined to comment. Qualcomm found itself in the EU's crosshairs in 2015.

The Commission's decision not to contest the Court finding was not surprising, said Peter Alexiadis, visiting professor at King's College in London.

""Even if the Commission were to succeed on the substantive grounds of appeal, such a victory would be nothing more than Pyrrhic, given the fact that the Commission decision would nevertheless inevitably be annulled on the procedural grounds, where the Commission's case seems to be weak,"" he said.

An appeal might, however, force the court to clarify which exclusivity relationships held by dominant firms were problematic, Alexiadis said.

""It is nevertheless disappointing that the antitrust Bar does not have a chance to benefit from a CJEU ruling on the question of economic incentives to pursue exclusivity strategies,"" he said.

The EU competition enforcer, in its 2018 decision, said Qualcomm paid billions of dollars to Apple from 2011 to 2016 to use only its chips in all its iPhones and iPads in order to block out rivals such as Intel Corp (INTC.O).

Vestager faces her next test on Sept. 14, when the General Court will rule on Google's challenge against a record 4.34-billion-euro antitrust fine imposed for using its Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals.

715,META,2023-01-30,"'They fire, we hire' - Germany seizes on Silicon Valley's woes","













BERLIN, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Faced with a tight labour market and a shortage of workers with key software engineering skills, some German companies are looking at thousands of layoffs in Silicon Valley as an opportunity to recruit top talent.

The U.S. West Coast has always been the main destination for ambitious software engineers looking to work in the best-paid, most elite corner of their profession, but the mass redundancies have created a pool of jobseekers that Germany is eager to tap.

""They fire, we hire,"" said Rainer Zugehoer, Chief People Officer at Cariad, the software subsidiary of automaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE). ""We have several hundred open positions in the U.S., in Europe and in China.""

Spooked by inflation and the prospect of recession, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Facebook owner Meta (META.O) have announced a combined almost 40,000 job cuts.

While Germany is also teetering on the edge of recession, its companies have grown more slowly in recent years and, in a country notorious for still handling business by fax, there are huge technology leaps to be made.

Germany, with one of the world's oldest populations, has gaping holes in its labour force: according to IT industry group Bitkom, 137,000 IT jobs are unfilled.

The government is simplifying immigration rules and dangling the prospect of easily-acquired citizenship to tempt skilled would-be immigrants, and regional authorities are pressing ahead.

""I would like to cordially invite you to move to Bavaria,"" wrote Judith Gerlach, digitalisation minister in Germany's wealthiest region on LinkedIn in a post addressed to the recently laid off.

Especially with the euro at dollar parity, few European companies pay rates that compete with the hundreds of thousands of dollars on offer at California's most successful companies, but some hope cheaper healthcare and lower costs compared to hotspots like San Francisco can help.

""And did I mention Oktoberfest?"" Gerlach added, adding Munich's famed beer festival to the strong labour protections that might prove attractive to the newly jobless.

Some are sceptical, with Bitkom's Bernhard Rohleder noting that Germany is competing not just with other countries for the most talented, but with potential recruits' home countries too.

Germany's penchant for red tape could be another challenge: companies are already reporting months-long delays in securing appointments for their new hires to get work permits.

""Bureaucracy in Germany is utterly crippling for most highly-qualified workers when they first encounter it, especially if they don't speak German,"" said Diana Stoleru of Berlin startup Lendis.

716,META,2022-10-20,Brazil electoral court cracks down on disinformation ahead of Lula-Bolsonaro runoff,"













BRASILIA, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Brazil's national electoral authority is announcing moves to crack down harder on online disinformation in a fierce presidential campaign between far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro and leftist challenger Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.

The Superior Electoral Court (TSE) said the measures are intended to curb the ""distribution and sharing of knowingly untrue or gravely decontextualized information affecting the electoral process,"" according to the resolution.

The tougher stance, defined by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who currently runs the TSE, reflects a more aggressive approach to a tidal wave of dirty campaigning that has engulfed Brazil ahead of the Oct. 30 runoff.

The TSE will levy fines of 100,000 reais ($19,000) per hour for online platforms that fail to take down fraudulent content after two hours, according to the resolution, which will also ban all paid political advertising online in the 48 hours before the vote.

The TSE has already ordered some disinformation videos to be taken down, including ones that say Lula consorts with Satan and Bolsonaro embraces cannibalism. The campaigns have also been ordered by the court to pull online ads saying the leftist will legalize abortion and the incumbent entertains pedophilia.

The TSE crackdown has raised concerns from both campaigns that it is edging into censorship of legitimate political debate.

The Bolsonaro camp has complained that the TSE has told it not to run ads calling Lula ""corrupt"" and a ""thief"" because bribery convictions that put him in jail were later annulled by the Supreme Court.

Brazilian broadcasters have also said they have been prohibited from using the words ""ex-convict,"" ""thief"" or ""corrupt"" when speaking about Lula. The broadcaster lobby ABERT protested that such decisions were interfering with freedom of expression.

By contrast, Bolsonaro allies complain that the TSE has not stopped opponents from accusing the president of ""genocide"" for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic that killed 680,000 Brazilians.

And over the weekend, Lula allies were up in arms when the court blocked an ad using clips of Bolsonaro talking about visiting the home of adolescent Venezuelan migrant girls who he suggested were preparing to prostitute themselves.

On Wednesday, Moraes stressed the need for faster takedown of disinformation in a meeting with tech companies including Twitter Inc (TWTR.N); Google, owned by Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O); Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) LinkedIn; and Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, run by Meta Platforms .

Moraes said the platforms had helped keep disinformation within reasonable bounds ahead of the election's first-round vote on Oct. 2.

""But we are having a second round that is getting worse and worse in this aspect, and this has required tougher measures by the TSE,"" he told reporters on Thursday.

717,META,2022-06-29,Factbox: Ambani children at centre of leadership change at India's Reliance,"













MUMBAI, June 29 (Reuters) - Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, one of the country's richest individuals, has initiated a long-anticipated leadership transition at the energy-to-retail conglomerate Reliance by handing over the chairmanship of its telecoms unit to his son. read more

The move is the first sign of change at Ambani's empire after the billionaire last year said his children would have significant roles in the business, adding Reliance was ""in the process of effecting a momentous leadership transition.""

Here are details about Ambani's three children who are expected to have greater say in India's biggest conglomerate valued at around $200 billion.

AKASH AMBANI, 30

Akash, Ambani's elder son, joined the leadership team at the group's telecom unit, Reliance Jio, in 2014, soon after completing his graduation in economics from Brown University.

As a non-executive director, he worked closely on the company's strategy and growth plans that made Jio India's biggest telecom operator with more than 400 million subscribers. He will now be the chairman of the telecom unit, Reliance said Tuesday. read more

Akash has been closely involved in product development and employee engagement to bring a ""young and vibrant culture"", the company says. An avid cricketer, he also plays a key role in the management of Mumbai Indians, a Reliance-owned team in IPL, the world's richest cricket league.

Akash was also part of a team that brokered a $5.7 billion investment in 2020 by Meta Platforms in a Reliance unit, Jio Platforms.

In 2019, he married Shloka Mehta, the daughter of a wealthy diamond merchant.

ISHA AMBANI, 30

Isha is Akash's twin sister and already tasked with driving the company's retail, e-commerce and luxury plans. Reliance is also India's biggest bricks-and-mortar retailer, with plans to expand swiftly into e-commerce to take on giants like Amazon.

She is also involved in expanding Reliance's presence in fashion through the company's Ajio e-commerce app as well as Reliance's partnerships with top international brands.

Isha has a business management degree from Stanford. Fortune magazine last year referred to her as ""Heiress on Duty"" while ranking her the 21st most powerful woman in India.

She is working closely in conceptualising a new Reliance mall, including how the company pitches the highly sensitive placement of rival luxury brands next to each other, Reuters has reported. read more

In 2018, Isha married Anand Piramal, the son of a billionaire industrialist with interests in real estate and pharma.

ANANT AMBANI, 27

Anant is Ambani's youngest son who is focussing on the conglomerate's new energy business, a key area of investment for Ambanis.

Reliance is vying to be at the forefront of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambition to ramp up green energy capacity.

Reliance has major expansion plans to diversify into clean energy projects, including solar and green hydrogen.

Anant has in the past addressed audiences, along with Akash and Isha, at company events. Anant graduated from Brown University in 2017.

718,META,2023-02-21,"Democratic U.S. Rep. Cicilline to resign, head Rhode Island foundation","













WASHINGTON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. Representative David Cicilline, a leading voice for gay rights and a critic of Big Tech's market power who has represented Rhode Island in Congress for over a decade, said Tuesday that he will resign from office effective June 1.

In a surprise announcement, Cicilline, a former Providence mayor, said he will become president and CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation, a major funder of nonprofit organizations in the state.

""The chance to lead the Rhode Island Foundation was unexpected, but it is an extraordinary opportunity to have an even more direct and meaningful impact on the lives of residents of our state,"" Cicilline said in a statement.

Cicilline will remain in office until he begins work at the foundation on June 1, his office said.

Republicans have a slim majority in the House, with 222 seats. There are 212 Democrats, including Cicilline, and one vacancy that is expected to add another Democrat following voting in a special election on Tuesday.

A special election to fill Cicilline's seat will be held sometime following his departure from Congress. It was not immediately known when that would be.

Democrats hold Rhode Island's two U.S. Senate seats and two House seats in this ""blue"" state.

In November, Cicilline briefly ran for the position of assistant House Democratic leader, in a bid to raise the profile of gay issues in Congress.

He dropped out after receiving assurances from party leaders that such issues would be represented, according to a House Democratic aide. He had run against Representative James Clyburn, who has long held top party leadership jobs in the House.

First elected to the House in 2010, Cicilline has established a solidly liberal voting record, defending low-income constituents from budget cuts and accusing Facebook of failing to discourage hate speech and Russian propaganda.

Cicilline also led the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, with the committee releasing a report in late 2020 that sharply criticized Facebook, now Meta (META.O), Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Apple (AAPL.O) for abusing the power of their platforms to maintain and expand their dominance.

While little to none of the proposed antitrust legislation aimed at tech or pharmaceutical giants became law, Cicilline was one of several lawmakers who successfully pushed for more aggressive enforcement of existing law.

One of the staffers who wrote the big tech report, Lina Khan, is now head of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

Cicilline was re-elected last November with 64% of the vote.

719,META,2023-01-23,"Explainer: Who is Jeff Zients, incoming White House chief of staff?","













Jan 27 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden named businessman and former COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients to become his second White House chief of staff on Friday, replacing Ron Klain, who is departing the administration after two years on the job.

Zients, a wealthy Democratic government official with a business management background, takes the helm as the U.S. government rolls out trillions in spending related to Biden-backed bills, and the president, 80, gears up to run for a second term.

WHO IS JEFF ZIENTS?

Zients, who served as co-chair for Biden's transition process after his 2020 election, has held fiscal policy and strategy roles in the administrations of both President Barack Obama and Biden.

He served as director of the National Economic Council and acting director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Obama administration. He also led a team that helped fix the HealthCare.gov website after its initial disastrous rollout.

In the Biden administration, Zients served as the first COVID-19 response coordinator, charged with rolling out a massive vaccine program nationwide in early 2021. He stepped down from that role in 2022 before being tapped to prepare for potential staff turnover at the White House after the midterm elections.

Zients was credited with overseeing the vaccine rollout, which resulted in more than 65% of the eligible population being fully vaccinated by December 2021. But the administration was criticized for not doing enough to increase COVID testing capacity or push back on anti-masking messages from Republicans amid the surge of the Omicron variant. More than 1.1 million people in the United States have died of COVID-19.

[1/2] Jeff Zients, U.S. President-elect Biden's choice to be coronavirus disease (COVID-19) czar to oversee the response to the pandemic, addresses a news conference as Biden listens at his transition headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S., December 8, 2020. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque 1 2

WHAT IS ZIENTS' BUSINESS BACKGROUND?

Zients, who is a millionaire many times over, served as chairman and chief executive of the Advisory Board, an education and healthcare consulting company. He was also a managing partner of Portfolio Logic, an investment firm. He was chair of the board of directors of Children's National Medical Center and a board member at Facebook, now called Meta Platforms Inc (META.O).

In May, Zients submitted an ethics disclosure that estimated his assets at between $85 million and $419 million. The assets included mutual funds, Washington-area commercial real estate and at least $1 million in gold bars.

WHAT DOES THE CHIEF OF STAFF DO?

The White House chief of staff is like the chief operating officer for the government, someone who runs daily operations, oversees implementation of the president's policies and serves as a liaison for cabinet members.

MANAGEMENT, NOT POLITICS

Zients' business and public service background will be helpful in the chief of staff role as Biden's administration spends the next two years on implementation of programs and legislation passed during the first two, including the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

Zients has a reputation for problem-solving and implementing, which may make his skill set well-aligned for this time in Biden's term.

720,META,2022-10-28,Exxon and Apple are in a similar boat,"













NEW YORK, Oct 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) might be able to give Apple (AAPL.O) a lesson in disruption. The oil company said Friday that it earned $20 billion in the third quarter, its best quarter ever, and nearly as much as Apple said it made earlier in the week. But the oil giant, which was the world’s most valuable firm about a decade ago, is only worth a fifth of the $2.5 trillion technology firm. The market’s newfound respect for earnings, and the recognition that ingrained beliefs can be fleeting, could partly close this gap.

Exxon’s profit was nearly triple last quarter what it was in the same quarter last year, and it wasn’t alone. Chevron’s profit, announced the same day, came close to doubling. The results are largely a function of higher commodity prices. Exxon said volume, or barrels of oil equivalent, only rose 1%, while Chevron (CVX.N) production was flat. Firms are also keeping investment under tight control. Oil investors have been clear that they want discipline, as demand will likely peak soon if it hasn’t already.

That means Exxon will presumably never reclaim its crown as the world’s most valuable firm, and Apple still earned far more than the company in the past year. Plus the $2.3 trillion technology giant’s earnings have grown far faster over the past 20 years. Investors assume, with good reason, that earnings growth at Tim Cook’s company will therefore continue to be faster.

Yet investor perceptions of future profit can be reassessed rapidly, as the massive falls in other tech companies like Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O) illustrated this week. They lost about $200 billion between them, as investors were disappointed with their growth, and the hefty investment they need to stay on top. It’s not unthinkable that, like with oil, new technologies will eventually upend Apple’s business. Staying profitable in the meantime is key.

721,META,2022-04-12,Private markets keep faith with the metaverse,"













LONDON, April 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Epic Games is defying the technology slump. The video game developer on Monday announced a $2 billion fundraising that valued it at $32 billion, with Sony (6758.T) and Lego parent Kirkbi putting in $1 billion each. The new valuation is 10% above the $29 billion secured 12 months ago. During that time gaming rivals Roblox (RBLX.N), Electronic Arts (EA.O) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO.O) have fallen 26%, on average. Facebook parent Meta Platforms (FB.O) is down a whopping 32% since boss Mark Zuckerberg launched his pricey pivot to virtual reality.

The booming valuation is hard to square with what little has been disclosed about Epic’s recent performance. Sales, mainly from its flagship “Fortnite” game, shrunk 10% to $5.1 billion between 2018 and 2020, according to a presentation disclosed during the company’s 2021 legal fight with Apple and a Verge article citing in-court testimony. But the group’s powerful “Unreal Engine” software could still be key to creating many of the immersive virtual worlds of the future. Lego teamed up with Epic last week to build “a place for kids to play in the metaverse”; Poland’s CD Projekt (CDR.WA) will switch to “Unreal” for its next blockbuster game. Those benefits may yet take years to come through, but sometimes the long game is easier to play outside the public eye. (By Oliver Taslic)

722,META,2023-01-17,Silvergate Capital reports net loss of $1 billion for the fourth quarter,"













Jan 17 (Reuters) - Silvergate Capital Corp (SI.N) reported a net loss of $1 billion in the fourth quarter, after reporting earlier this month that investors spooked by the collapse of crypto exchange FTX pulled out more than $8 billion in deposits in the last three months of 2022.

Shares of the bank were last up more than 10% as the bank attempted to reassure investors that it remained committed to serving the digital asset industry.

""We are in the process of evaluating our product portfolio and customer relationships with a focus on profitability,"" said Silvergate Chief Executive Alan Lane on a conference call with analysts on Tuesday.

The bank will offboard certain customers separate from its core business in the coming weeks, and will eliminate certain products like digital asset custody that have become ""too costly or complex,"" Lane added.

The crypto-focused bank had previously announced it would cut its workforce by 40%, or about 200 employees, as it tries to rein in costs amid a deepening crypto downturn.

Silvergate had released a preliminary earnings report on Jan. 5, in which it reported total deposits from digital asset customers declining to $3.8 billion at the end of December, compared to $11.9 billion at the end of September. The company sold $5.2 billion of debt securities at a loss of $718 million in the fourth quarter to maintain liquidity.

The dire earnings report shows the extent of the impact on the digital asset industry from the downfall of crypto exchange FTX, which filed for bankruptcy in November after failing to cover customer withdrawals, marking a stunning reversal of fortunes for what was one of the world's biggest crypto exchanges.

Silvergate had said earlier it had no outstanding loans or investments in FTX, but its shares have shed nearly 60% of their value since the exchange's meltdown, which sparked a wild crypto sell-off.

Slowing the expansion of its business, La Jolla, California-based Silvergate also said earlier this month it would delay the launch of a blockchain-based payment solution it had purchased from Meta Platforms Inc-backed Diem Group last year.

The bank said it would take an impairment charge of $196 million in the fourth quarter on assets purchased for the payment solution venture.

Founded in 1988, Silvergate ventured into crypto in 2013. The bank counts major exchanges like Coinbase Global Inc (COIN.O) and Kraken among its customers.

The bank had also operated a mortgage warehouse business, but announced in December that it would be winding down that division, citing the rising interest rate environment and reduction in mortgage volumes. Company filings show that the bank received $4.3 billion in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco in the fourth quarter.

723,META,2022-11-11,"Disney plans to freeze hiring and cut some jobs, memo shows","













Nov 11 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) is planning to freeze hiring and cut some jobs as it strives to move the Disney+ streaming service to profitability against a backdrop of economic uncertainty, according to a memo seen by Reuters on Friday.

Chief Executive Bob Chapek sent the memo to Disney's leaders, saying the company is instituting a targeted hiring freeze and anticipates ""some small staff reductions"" as it looks to manage costs.

""While certain macroeconomic factors are out of our control, meeting these goals requires all of us to continue doing our part to manage the things we can control - most notably, our costs,"" Chapek wrote in the memo.

The move came after Disney missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly earnings on Tuesday as the entertainment giant racked up more losses from its push into streaming video, which it refers to as its direct-to-consumer (DTC) business. Shares of the company fell more than 13% on Wednesday following its results.

Disney has said the fast-growing service added 12 million subscribers in its fiscal fourth quarter but reported an operating loss of nearly $1.5 billion. The company said Disney+ would become profitable in fiscal 2024, with losses having peaked in the quarter.

The streaming service is known for original series including the ""Star Wars"" entries ""The Mandalorian,"" ""Andor"" and ""Obi-Wan Kenobi,"" the Marvel entries ""WandaVision,"" ""Hawkeye"" and ""She-Hulk: Attorney at Law,"" and content hubs for Disney, Pixar, Marvel and ""Star Wars"" films.

Wall Street analysts voiced concern about Disney's escalating streaming costs. MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson observed in a note this week that ""the company has to prove that their pivot to DTC will be worth the investment price that is currently being paid.""

Corporate America is making deep cuts to its employee base to brace for an economic downturn. Meta Platforms (META.O) said this week it would cut more than 11,000 jobs, or 13% of its workforce to rein in costs.

One of Disney's studio peers, Warner Bros Discovery, has undergone dramatic cost-cutting efforts, including layoffs, as the recently merged company restructures its content operations.

Chapek said Disney has established a task force, including Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy and General Counsel Horacio Gutierrez, to help him make ""critical big picture decisions.""

The company already has begun looking at content and marketing spending, but Chapek said the cuts would not sacrifice quality. Hiring will be limited to a small subset of critical positions, and some staff reductions are anticipated, as the company looks to make itself more cost-efficient, Chapek wrote.

Chapek said business travel would be limited and trips would require advance approval, or conducted virtually as much as possible.

""Our transformation is designed to ensure we thrive not just today, but well into the future,"" Chapek wrote.

The memo was first reported by CNBC.

724,META,2022-06-28,India's Ambani hands Reliance telco unit to son in first step to leadership change,"[1/2] Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries, arrives to address the company's annual general meeting in Mumbai, India July 5, 2018. REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas















June 29 (Reuters) - Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani has stepped down from the telecoms arm of Reliance Industries (RELI.NS), handing the reins to his son Akash and setting the stage for a leadership transition at his energy-to-retail conglomerate.

Mukesh's 30-year-old son Akash has been appointed chairman of the board of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, the company said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. Akash was already a non-executive director at the telecoms arm.

Mukesh Ambani, who ranked tenth on the Forbes global billionaire's list, signaled last year his children would have significant roles in the family's business, which has grown six fold in the past decade into a $218 billion empire.

Reliance is ""in the process of effecting a momentous leadership transition"", he said at an event in December.

Analysts say the 65-year-old has positioned experienced executives and long-time friends and family to steer his children through the transition, and they have taken larger roles at annual general meetings and led some company announcements.

Shares in Reliance Industries rose 2.7% on Wednesday.

Akash Ambani, who attended Brown University, was part of a team that brokered a $5.7 billion investment in 2020 by Meta Platforms (META.O) in Jio Platforms, a Reliance unit.

Akash's twin sister Isha is a director on the boards of Jio as well as Reliance Retail, which houses the conglomerate's ambitious bets in India's brick-and-mortar space. Media reports have tipped her as the next chairperson of the retail business.

The youngest of the siblings, Anant, is a director at Reliance's renewable energy, and oil and chemical units.

RISE OF JIO

Tuesday's move is Mukesh Ambani's biggest step back from the business yet. Still, he will continue as the chairman of Jio Platforms, a Reliance unit that owns Jio Infocomm and other digital assets.

It comes two decades after Mukesh's father Dhirubhai Ambani, a well-known industrialist, died intestate, sparking a long-running and public feud for control of assets between Mukesh and his younger brother Anil.

The discord, and years of lawsuits and failed deals, bankrupted Anil Ambani, who in 2008 was No. 6 on Forbes' richest list and once owned a promising telecom company called Reliance Communications that went bust a few years before Jio Infocomm entered the industry.

Jio Infocomm upended India's telecom sector with its cut-throat pricing, which forced some rivals out of the market and pushed others into the red.

Jio, which started out offering mobile teleservices, has been aggressively investing in services like internet broadband and forging ties with handset makers to launch low-cost smartphones and providing 5G services.

Now India's largest telecom operator, Jio Infocomm has 405.7 million wireless broadband subscribers as of April 30, and commands 35.5% of the market.

Last fiscal year, Jio Infocomm accounted for 10% of Reliance Industries' total revenue and nearly a quarter of its profits.

725,META,2022-04-29,Morning Bid: Something's off,"













A look at the day ahead in markets from Julien Ponthus.

It's the final day of trading of April and it does look like despite the fireworks on Wall Street last night, this month bears sombre omens for what's to come, notably with Asian shares on the verge of their worst month since the COVID-19 March 2020 crash.

It's even worse for the Nasdaq (.NDX) which is on course for its biggest losses in a month since the financial crisis of 2008.

For all the enthusiasm surrounding the earnings of Meta Platforms (FB.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O) delivered a disappointing quarter while Apple (AAPL.O) had dire news to share with the market after the bell, despite record profits and sales. read more

COVID-19 lockdowns snarl production and demand in China and the iPhone maker warned that the war in Ukraine, which led Apple to stop sales in Russia, would cut sales more deeply in the fiscal third quarter.

Overall, the S&P 500 has had a terrible ride so far in 2022, losing roughly 10% of its value, wiping off four trillion dollars in market capitalisation.

And it's hard to ignore the dotcom bubble flavoured 'irrational exuberance' whiff that surrounds Elon Musk's $44 billion cash deal for Twitter, particularly when the social media reported revenue and ad sales that fell short of expectations. read more

There's also been plenty of puzzling market moves lately. The dollar enjoyed its best month in a decade and hit its highest level in 20 years but data showed the U.S. economy unexpectedly contracted in the first quarter. read more

Of course, with investors betting on a 50 basis point interest rate hike at the Federal Reserve's meeting next week, a U.S. aggressive monetary tightening remains the driving force across financial markets for the foreseeable future.

In that light, it is not surprising that a warning from Japan's Ministry of Finance failed to deter the dollar from cruising above 130 yen for the first time since 2002.

Perhaps not surprising either that the euro, weakened by the Russian gas standoff, also felt the might of the greenback and fell to a five-year low of $1.04 even as 10-year German bund yields rose 10 basis points with German inflation hitting its highest level in more than 40 years.

726,META,2022-06-22,"U.S. tech companies yank job offers, leaving college grads scrambling","













June 22 (Reuters) - One by one, over the last week of May, Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) rang up some members of its incoming class of new hires who had recently graduated from college and revoked the job offers in 15-minute calls, according to some of the recipients.

“It was traumatic,” Iris Guo, an incoming associate product manager living in Toronto, told Reuters. She received the bad news in a 10:45 p.m. video call that her position had been eliminated. Since then, she has raced to find new employment in order to secure her U.S. work visa.

More than 21,500 tech workers in the United States have lost their jobs so far this year, according to Layoffs.fyi, a website that monitors job cuts. The number of tech layoffs in May alone skyrocketed 780% over the first four months of the year combined, according to outplacement services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

But recent college graduates like Guo, who graduated from the University of Waterloo and studied financial management and computer science, represent a new dimension to the cutbacks as their nascent careers are eliminated even before they begin. The trend reflects a new austerity sweeping across some parts of the tech industry such as crypto and venture capital-backed companies.

For crypto firms, the belt-tightening is due to the recent crash in cryptocurrency prices and venture capital-backed companies are also cutting costs to avoid going back to the market for additional funding, said Kyle Stanford, senior analyst for venture capital at Pitchbook.

Crypto firm Coinbase Global Inc (COIN.O) laid off 18% of staff this month, payments firms Klarna and Bolt Financial collectively laid off over 900 people while major names like Meta Platforms Inc , Lyft Inc (LYFT.O) and Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N) have said they will slow or freeze hiring.

In what appears to be a counter trend to the Great Resignation of 2022, when legions quit for new jobs, some tech job-seekers now face cost cuts and hiring freezes amid four-decade-high inflation, a war raging in Ukraine and the ongoing pandemic.

In the case of those who were poised to join Twitter, the whims of billionaire Elon Musk have also caused stress. Musk has agreed to buy Twitter for $44 billion, but his recent tweets have raised questions about when and if the acquisition will be completed. read more

To be sure, hiring in the tech sector as a whole has remained strong, according to experts from staffing and consulting firms. Tech roles in the healthcare and finance industries are strong, as well as in the information technology field, said Thomas Vick, a Texas-based regional director for staffing firm Robert Half’s tech practice.

But for the incoming class of new hires out of college, losing their job offers now is especially damaging as they said they are locked out of companies like Meta Platforms, Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and other tech giants, which have already secured their new cohort of recruits.

Lucas Durrant, an electrical engineering graduate from Canada, was set to start his new job as a software engineer at Bolt last week. While on vacation a few weeks ago, he received an email stating that his offer was rescinded. Bolt announced it would begin layoffs in late May, citing economic conditions.

“It feels a bit like a race against the clock before we see a bigger economic downturn,” said Durrant. “Pretty soon, I’m also going to be competing against people graduating in 2023.”

LIMITED OPTIONS

At least 40 recent college graduates have lost job offers in the past few weeks, according to LinkedIn posts and Google spreadsheets that circulated online to help those affected find new positions.

As of Tuesday, 22 recent grads were listed on a spreadsheet as having offers rescinded from Twitter and nine people were listed on a separate spreadsheet for Coinbase.

In a statement, Twitter said it acknowledged that the rescinded offers could put candidates in a difficult position, and said it is offering compensation to those affected.

Coinbase pointed to a June 2 blog post that said the decision to rescind a number of offers was not made lightly, but was ""necessary to ensure we are only growing in the highest-priority areas.""

Chloe Ho, a recent graduate from the University of California, Davis, and who is originally from Hong Kong, has until Sept. 29 to find a new job, or be forced to leave the United States. Ho had accepted a position as a content marketing specialist for an online grocery company called Weee! before the position was rescinded.

As a non-U.S. citizen who needs a new employer to sponsor her work visa, “my options are very limited,” she said.

Ho said she canceled a lease for a new apartment in the San Francisco Bay area, pulled out of vacation plans with friends and will now spend the next three months networking for a new job during the day and submitting applications at night. “I had planned everything around this job,” she said.

Many affected graduates took to LinkedIn to express their disappointment, detail how the rescinded offers upended plans for cross-country moves and ask for referrals to new companies.

Graduates who spoke with Reuters said they were surprised by the level of outreach from people offering to help. Still, the sting of losing their dream jobs has lingered.

One recent college graduate who was set to join Coinbase, and did not want to be named due to his ongoing job hunt, said that just a week before losing his job offer, he had received an email from Coinbase with reassurance that the company did not plan to walk back existing offers.

“I was disappointed for a few reasons. I didn’t think leadership would make that decision,” he said.

While the companies may be saving some money in the short term, they are risking “potentially catastrophic” reputational damage, said Brian Kropp, distinguished vice president of Gartner's human resources practice.

“Just think about how unfair that is to people you’re rescinding the offer from,” he said. “You’re putting them in a painful situation.”

BRUSSELS, March 25 (Reuters) - The European Union and the United States announced a preliminary data transfer deal on Friday, seeking to end the limbo in which thousands of companies found themselves after Europe's top court threw out two previous pacts due to concerns about U.S. surveillance.

While businesses cheered the news, Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems, whose campaign about the risk of U.S. intelligence agencies accessing Europeans' data in a long-running dispute with Meta (FB.O) led to the court vetoes, criticised the lack of details.

U.S. President Joe Biden and European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said at a joint news conference in Brussels that the provisional agreement takes into account the court's concerns and offers stronger legal protections.

""Today, we've agreed to unprecedented protections for data privacy and security for citizens,"" Biden said.

""I am very pleased that we have found an agreement in principle on a new framework for transatlantic data flows,"" von der Leyen said.

""This will enable predictable and trustworthy data flows between the EU and U.S., safeguarding privacy and civil liberties,"" she added, without elaborating.

An EU official familiar with the matter said it will likely take months to turn the provisional agreement into a final legal deal.

""First, the U.S. needs to prepare their executive order, and then we need to do our internal consultation in the Commission and within the European Data Protection Board,"" the official said, referring to the EU privacy watchdog.

Companies welcomed the provisional deal.

""Legal certainty about data flows will spur innovation, growth, and job creation. This is a win-win-agreement for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic,"" said Markus J. Beyrer, director of lobbying group BusinessEurope.

""A new agreement will provide companies of all sizes the legal certainty to transfer, analyze, and use data on both sides of the Atlantic. The ability to move data is critical in today’s digitally connected economy,"" said U.S. Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice President Myron Brilliant.

Activist Schrems, however, said the lack of details was troubling and that if the United States was only offering executive reassurances instead of changing its surveillance laws, he would not hesitate to go to court again.

""The final text will need more time, once this arrives we will analyze it in depth, together with our U.S. legal experts. If it is not in line with EU law, we or another group will likely challenge it,"" he said in a statement.

The latest data accord risks being shot down again if it is not strong enough, said Patrick Van Eecke, a partner at law firm Cooley in Brussels.

""As before, privacy activists will probably try to have this agreement invalidated by the European Court of Justice, and the recent Supreme Court decision in the FBI v. Fazaga case will not make it easier for the U.S. administration to convince Europe that the United States has equally strong privacy protections,"" he said.

728,META,2022-09-16,U.S. appeals court rejects big tech's right regulate online speech,"













Sept 16 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday upheld a Texas law that bars large social media companies from banning or censoring users based on ""viewpoint,"" a setback for technology industry groups that say the measure would turn platforms into bastions of dangerous content.

The largely 2-1 ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, sets up the potential for the U.S. Supreme Court to rule on the law, which conservatives and right-wing commentators have said is necessary to prevent ""Big Tech"" from suppressing their views.

""Today we reject the idea that corporations have a freewheeling First Amendment right to censor what people say,"" Judge Andrew Oldham, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, wrote in the ruling.

The Texas law was passed by the state's Republican-led legislature and signed by its Republican governor.

The tech groups that challenged the law and were on the losing end of Friday's ruling include NetChoice and the Computer & Communications Industry Association, which count Meta Platforms' (META.O) Facebook, Twitter (TWTR.N) and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) YouTube as members.

They have sought to preserve rights to regulate user content when they believe it may lead to violence, citing concerns that unregulated platforms will enable extremists such as Nazi supporters, terrorists and hostile foreign governments.

The association on Friday said it disagreed with forcing private companies to give equal treatment to all viewpoints. ""'God Bless America' and 'Death to America' are both viewpoints, and it is unwise and unconstitutional for the state of Texas to compel a private business to treat those the same,"" it said in a statement.

Some conservatives have labeled the social media companies' practices abusive, pointing to Twitter's permanent suspension of Trump from the platform shortly after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of his supporters. Twitter had cited ""the risk of further incitement of violence"" as a reason.

The Texas law forbids social media companies with at least 50 million monthly active users from acting to ""censor"" users based on ""viewpoint,"" and allows either users or the Texas attorney general to sue to enforce the law.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Twitter hailed the ruling as ""massive victory for the constitution and free speech.""

Because the 5th Circuit ruling conflicts with part of a ruling by the 11th Circuit, the aggrieved parties have a stronger case for petitioning the Supreme Court to hear the matter.

In May, the 11th Circuit, based in Atlanta, found that most of a similar Florida law violates the companies' free speech rights and cannot be enforced. read more

729,META,2022-12-02,"U.S., EU to address Inflation Reduction Act fears constructively -draft","













BRUSSELS, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The United States and the European Union will seek to tackle EU concerns about a new U.S. green energy subsidy package in a constructive way, officials from both sides are due to say at a meeting next week, a draft joint statement shows.

The 27-country bloc fears that the U.S. $430 billion Inflation Reduction Act with its generous tax breaks may lure away EU businesses and disadvantage European companies from car manufacturers to makers of green technology.

The topic is one of several on the agenda of the EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council meeting on Dec. 5.

Participants include U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and European Commission Executive Vice Presidents Valdis Dombrovskis and Margrethe Vestager.

""We acknowledge the EU's concerns and underline our commitment to address them constructively,"" a Dec. 1 draft joint statement intended to be issued after the meeting said.

The draft document, which was seen by Reuters and could still be revised, did not set out any specific measures.

The EU executive declined to comment on the draft document.

""The meeting will allow for substantial discussions, including about the concerns around the IRA, which is also dealt with in a dedicated process,"" a Commission spokesperson said.

With the United States and the EU both set to give huge state funding to chipmakers, the two will agree to set up a common tool for sharing information about public support, a move aimed at avoiding a subsidy race, the document said.

Both sides will exchange information and best practice on investment approaches and terms and conditions for public support.

The document pointed to the threat from non-market economic policies and practices, in particular those affecting medical devices companies, saying both sides would look into appropriate policy tools and coordinate action to diversify supply chains.

""To that end, we will continue building a shared understanding of China's economic and industrial directives and other non-market policies and practices,"" it said.

A separate draft joint statement on protecting human rights defenders online took aim at the responsibilities of Big Tech firms such as Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Meta (META.O) and Twitter.

""We urge companies to prevent the misuse of their products and platforms, conduct due diligence, take effective action to address all forms of online violence and unlawful or arbitrary surveillance against human rights defenders...,"" it said.

""We also support stronger accountability for technology platforms and recognize the role of government to enhance online safety, security and privacy.""

In an unexpected move, EU industry chief Thierry Breton will skip the meeting as the agenda allocated only two hours of ministerial meetings on issues concerning European businesses, his aide said. Breton will instead travel to the United States for bilateral visits in early 2023.

730,META,2022-11-04,EXCLUSIVE Telcos push EU to make Big Tech pay for network costs,"[1/3] Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google logos are seen in this combination photo from Reuters















PARIS/STOCKHOLM, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Telecom operators are pushing the European Union to implement new laws that would make Big Tech pay for network costs, following Australia's example, according to four sources close to the matter.

Europe's telecoms operators have lobbied for a financial contribution from U.S. tech firms such as Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O), Meta's Facebook (META.O) and Netflix (NFLX.O), saying that they use a huge part of the region's internet traffic.

The latest proposal, which hasn't been reported, is being discussed within the telecoms lobby group GSMA, an association that represents more than 750 mobile operators.

""GSMA is coordinating a proposal that speaks to Big Tech contribution to European infrastructure investment,"" said John Giusti, GSMA's chief regulatory officer, without elaborating on the content of the proposal.

A letter will be sent to EU industry chief Thierry Breton in the next five to six weeks, Giusti said.

Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The proposal comes ahead of the 27-country bloc's consultation on a so-called ""fair share"" contribution from the likes of Google, Netflix, Meta and Amazon (AMZN.O), which account for more than half of the internet traffic.

These platforms dismiss the idea and consider it an internet traffic tax.

Australia's recently-adopted laws in its own spat with Google and Facebook have emerged as the most-favoured weapon for telecoms operators in their dispute with Big Tech companies, the sources said.

The rules, first aimed at compelling tech giants to pay for news content online, allow an Australian government-appointed arbitrator to set fees if Big Tech companies and news publishers fail to find a common ground over copyright.

Rupert Murdoch's News Corp reached last year a content-supply deal with Meta's Facebook in Australia under the rules, helping to put an end to a dispute that saw the social media giant briefly shut down thousands of pages in the country.

Under Australia's binding so-called ""final-offer arbitration"", the parties have to negotiate in good faith. But if a deal can't be struck between them, they have to present their offers and defer to an arbitrator to choose one.

The goal is to encourage tech giants and news publishers to reach an agreement before being compelled to go for this last resort procedure.

The telecoms operators that are part of GSMA, including some of Europe's largest such as Orange (ORAN.PA), Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) and Telefonica (TEF.MC) agree that the Australian way is the best approach, the sources said.

No formal document has yet been sent to Breton, the sources said. Officials are discussing whether the proposal will be made directly by the GSMA or from a group of chief executives, one of the sources said.

Breton has said he will seek feedback from both sides before drafting legislation.

731,META,2022-12-06,Exclusive: Google launches anti-misinformation campaign in India,"Summary

Summary Companies False information has been blamed for inciting violence

'Pre-bunking' videos aim to stop misinformation spreading

India trial follows studies in parts of Europe















STOCKHOLM/LONDON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Google's (GOOGL.O) Jigsaw subsidiary is launching a new anti-misinformation project in India, aimed at preventing misleading information that has been blamed for inciting violence, a top executive said.

The initiative will use ""prebunking"" videos – designed to counter false claims before they become widespread – circulated on the company's YouTube platform and other social media sites.

Google's efforts to challenge the spread of misinformation mark a contrast with rival Twitter which is cutting its trust and safety teams, despite new owner Elon Musk saying it will not become a ""free-for-all hellscape"".

Google recently conducted an experiment in Europe where it sought to counter anti-refugee narratives online in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The experiment in India will be bigger in scope as it will deal with multiple local languages -- Bengali, Hindi and Marathi -- and cover diverse sections of a country populated by over a billion people.

""This presented an opportunity to research prebunking in a non-western, global south market,"" said Beth Goldberg, Jigsaw's head of research and development.

Like other countries, misinformation spreads rapidly across India, mostly through social media, creating political and religious tensions.

Indian government officials have called on tech companies such as Google, Meta, and Twitter to take stronger action against the spread of fake news.

The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (I&B) has repeatedly invoked ""extraordinary powers"" to block YouTube channels, and some Twitter and Facebook accounts, allegedly used to spread harmful misinformation.

Inflammatory messages have also spread via Meta's messaging service Whatsapp, which has more than 200 million users in India. In 2018, the company curbed the number of times a message could be forwarded, after false claims about child abductors led to mass beatings of more than a dozen people, some of whom died.

Working in collaboration with the Alfred Landecker Foundation, a pro-democracy organization based in Germany, the philanthropic investment firm Omidya Network India, and a number of smaller regional partners, Jigsaw will produce five videos in three different languages.

After watching the videos, viewers will be asked to fill in a short multiple-choice questionnaire, designed to gauge what they have learned about misinformation. The company's recent research on the subject suggested viewers were 5% more likely to identify misinformation after watching such videos.

The Indian initiative will focus on issues that resonate in the country, Goldberg added.

""By forewarning individuals and equipping them to spot and refute misleading arguments, they gain resilience to being misled in the future.""

Results are expected to be published in summer 2023.

REDMOND, Wash., July 18 (Reuters) - U.S. companies are facing a ""new era"" in which fewer people are entering the workforce and pressure to pay higher salaries may become permanent, Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) President Brad Smith told Reuters in an interview.

At the software maker's Redmond, Washington, headquarters, Smith highlighted one source of what he called today's ""greater economic turbulence."" In his office, he walked over to a wall-sized touchscreen device and pulled up a series of charts, showing how population growth has tumbled in the United States, Europe, China and Japan.

The trend of around 5 million people expanding the U.S. working age population every five years since 1950 has shifted, starting in the period between 2016 and 2020 when growth slowed to 2 million, and is now slowing further, said Smith late last week, citing United Nations data. Major markets overseas have seen outright labor force declines.

""That helps explain part of why you can have low growth and a labor shortage at the height at the same time. There just aren't as many people entering the workforce,"" said Smith, who helps oversee the nearly $2 trillion company selling cloud-computing services to major businesses.

Government stimulus during the pandemic, COVID-19 concerns, childcare and other factors have contributed to the current labor shortage as well.

Executives including Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), have recently fretted about the economy. Zuckerberg warned the United States might face ""one of the worst downturns that we've seen in recent history,"" though Smith said it would be premature to declare a recession inevitable. read more

Competing for limited workers, Microsoft recently boosted pay at the same time as it slowed hiring, company officials said. The software maker also trimmed a small percentage of jobs pegged to the start of its new fiscal year.

Smith said Microsoft's business selling productivity tools, cloud services and technology with artificial intelligence, which enterprises may need in a downturn, sets it up to weather economic challenges. The company has recently faced antitrust scrutiny in Europe, and Smith said Microsoft had until October to ""finalize the implementation"" of changes he promised. read more

U.S. Department of Labor data from June showed employers broadly had continued to raise wages and hire more workers than expected. Labor force participation, however, shrank for the second time in three months, to 62.2%, showing no persistent improvement since the start of 2022. read more

Population growth has become a hot topic in the tech industry. Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk, who reportedly has nine children including newborn twins, has particularly drawn attention to the low U.S. birth rate. ""Doing my best to help the underpopulation crisis,"" he wrote on Twitter.

Smith said he concurred with Musk ""maybe in the problem. I'm not recommending the same solution.""

733,META,2022-10-17,Kanye West agrees to buy social media app Parler,"













Oct 17 (Reuters) - American rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye, has agreed in principle to buy Parler, the social media platform popular among U.S. conservatives, parent company Parlement Technologies said on Monday.

Nashville-based Parler, which has raised about $56 million to date, said it expects the deal to close during the fourth quarter of 2022. It did not give a deal value.

Parler, which launched in 2018, has been reinstated on Google and Apple Inc's app stores after being removed following the U.S. Capitol riots in January 2021. Parler is one of several social media platforms, including Gettr, Gab and Truth Social, that position themselves as free-speech alternatives to Twitter Inc (TWTR.N).

Last month, Parler created a new parent company, Parlement Technologies Inc, as part of an overhaul.

In an interview with Reuters Monday, Parlement Technologies Chief Executive Officer George Farmer said the deal talks with Ye began recently, after Paris Fashion Week.

In Paris on Oct. 3, Ye, who is also a fashion designer, wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the phrase: “White Lives Matter.” Four days later, he made Instagram posts that several Jewish groups called anti-Semitic. Meta Platforms (META.O), which owns Instagram and Facebook, locked Ye out of his Instagram account for the posts.

Ye then moved to Twitter, posting on Oct. 8 for the first time in two years; Twitter soon locked his account.

The Parler deal came together quickly, CEO Farmer said, and Parlement was ""presented with an opportunity.""

“The motivating factor with him was the discussion about Instagram blocking him.” Farmer declined to comment on whether the deal includes a break-up fee if either party terminates it.

Ye in September terminated his partnership with apparel retailer Gap Inc (GPS.N), while German sporting goods maker Adidas (ADSGn.DE) on Oct. 6 said it is reviewing its business partnership with the rapper.

Farmer said Monday he is not concerned about Parler's advertising prospects under Ye.

“I see this as a warning shot across the bow for companies that want to de-platform people,"" Farmer said. ""There are increasingly advertisers who want to advertise to this space.”

Ye seemed to have joined Parler on Monday and had about 91 followers at the time of the announcement. He now has 3,900.

""In a world where conservative opinions are considered to be controversial we have to make sure we have the right to freely express ourselves,"" he said in a statement.

Farmer says Parler has 16.5 million registered users. Research firm Apptopia estimates the platform has been installed 11.7 million times since launch, with an estimated 40,000 daily active users.

Forbes estimates Ye to have a net worth of $2 billion.

734,META,2022-03-23,Tech leads rebound in world stocks despite surging yields,"[1/3] Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., March 22, 2022. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid















March 23 (Reuters) - Battered technology and growth shares have shrugged off rising bond yields to drive a rebound in world stocks as some investors view them as a hedge to inflation against the backdrop of supply-chain snarls and an intensifying war in Ukraine.

The NYSE FANG+TM index (.NYFANG), which includes the five core FAANG stocks - Meta Platforms (FB.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Netflix (NFLX.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) - posted their best six-day performance on Tuesday, rising 22% and far outpacing the S&P 500's (.SPX) 8% rise in the same period.

Growth stocks, which usually underperform as yields rise, surged despite the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield hitting its highest since 2019 on fears of aggressive monetary policy tightening.

Higher interest rates typically hurt tech and growth stocks as their valuations rely more heavily on future cash flows. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index (.IXIC) is down nearly 10% year-to-date, steeper than the 4% decline in the benchmark S&P 500.

""In the face of rising 10-year yield, (investors are) leaving bonds going toward equities, and they are going toward the growth areas that had been beaten up, but I question whether this is going to last,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York.

Some analysts said the technology stocks are proving to be inflation resistant as their profits are largely immune to rising commodities prices when compared to manufacturing and consumer companies.

""High operational gearing, sticky consumer and global footprint lends itself to some sympathy,"" said Mark Taylor, sales trader at Mirabaud Securities.

Tech giants listed in Hong Kong (.HSTECH) have surged 36% since last Tuesday's bottom, helped by Beijing's market-friendly concessions last week that buoyed hopes that the worst of the regulatory tightening was over.

Tech stocks in Japan (.IELEC.T) rose for seven straight sessions, while those in Europe (.SX8P) have also enjoyed gains.

""The Chinese market has had a strong rebound,"" Emmanuel Cau, head of equity strategy at Barclays, said, adding that with the broader market gaining, many funds could reengage with a sector shunned by investors at the start of the year.

Analysts at Vanda Research said a revival in buying activity from retail investors following the Federal Reserve's rate hike last week aided the rebound in stocks.

WASHINGTON, May 25 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) has agreed to pay $150 million to settle allegations it misused private information, like phone numbers, to target advertising after telling users the information would be used for security reasons, according to court documents filed on Wednesday.

Twitter's settlement covers allegations that it misrepresented the ""security and privacy"" of user data between May 2013 and September 2019, according to the court documents.

The company will pay $150 million as part of the settlement announced by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In addition to the monetary settlement, the agreement requires Twitter to improve its compliance practices.

The complaint said that the misrepresentations violated the FTC Act and a 2011 settlement with the agency.

""Specifically, while Twitter represented to users that it collected their telephone numbers and email addresses to secure their accounts, Twitter failed to disclose that it also used user contact information to aid advertisers in reaching their preferred audiences,"" the complaint said.

Twitter's chief privacy officer, Damien Kieran, said in a statement that with the settlement ""we have aligned with the agency on operational updates and program enhancements"" to protect user privacy and security.

Twitter is a free service that makes money primarily through advertising. Billionaire Elon Musk, who is buying the service for $44 billion, has criticized its ads-driven business model and pledged to diversify its revenue sources.

""If Twitter was not truthful here, what else is not true? This is very concerning news,"" Musk said in a tweet late on Wednesday, commenting on the social media company's ad practices and the fine.

U.S. officials pointed out that of the $3.4 billion in revenue that Twitter earned in 2019, about $3 billion was from advertising.

The company made $5 billion in revenue for 2021. It said in a filing earlier this month that it had put aside $150 million after agreeing ""in principle"" upon a penalty with the FTC.

""Twitter obtained data from users on the pretext of harnessing it for security purposes but then ended up also using the data to target users with ads,"" said FTC Chair Lina Khan in a statement. ""This practice affected more than 140 million Twitter users, while boosting Twitter's primary source of revenue.""

The complaint also alleges that Twitter falsely said it complied with the European Union-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks, which bar companies from using data in ways that consumers do not authorize.

Twitter's settlement follows years of fallout over the privacy practices of tech companies.

Revelations in 2018 that Facebook, the world's biggest social network, was using phone numbers provided for two-factor authentication to serve ads enraged privacy advocates.

Facebook, now called Meta (FB.O), similarly settled with the FTC over the issue as part of a $5 billion agreement reached in 2019.

736,META,2022-06-20,Tencent forms 'extended reality' unit as metaverse race gathers steam,"













HONG KONG, June 20 (Reuters) - China's Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) announced to its staff on Monday the official formation of an ""extended reality"" (XR) unit, three people familiar with the matter said, formally placing its bets on the metaverse concept of virtual worlds.

The unit is tasked with building up the extended reality business for Tencent including both software and hardware, the sources said, adding that it will be led by Tencent Games Global's Chief Technology Officer Li Shen and will be part of the company's Interactive Entertainment business group.

Two of the sources said the unit will eventually have over 300 staff, a generous figure given how Tencent has been cost cutting and slowing down hiring. However, they also cautioned that the hiring plans are still fluid, as the company will adjust the unit's headcount based on its performance.

The unit was first formed earlier this year but remained shrouded in secrecy, the three sources said. Extended reality is a term that refers to immersive technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality, which are seen to be the building blocks of the metaverse.

Tencent, China's most valuable company, declined to comment.

Investors, entrepreneurs and established tech giants around the world have latched on to the concept of the metaverse, ever since Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook which recently changed its name to Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), announced that he would devote the future of his company to building a metaverse.

Companies from Microsoft (MSFT.O) to Disney (DIS.N) have announced they are also working on their own metaverses, with Chinese and U.S. firms from TikTok owner-ByteDance to Apple (AAPL.O) also building up their headset units involving XR technologies.

The XR unit will mark a rare foray into hardware for Tencent, which is mostly known for its software such as its suite of games as well as social media applications.

One of the sources said the unit was viewed internally as a passion project of Tencent founder and chief executive Pony Ma who first highlighted the importance of the metaverse, or what he called an ""all-real internet"", in late 2020.

The introduction of the new team stands in contrast to downsizing happening in other parts of Tencent, which has been implementing cost control measures and scaling back non-core businesses, such as the shuttering of its Penguin Esports unit, to cope with the fall-out from a regulatory crackdown.

Tencent has remained largely coy, publicly, about its metaverse plans. Last November, it told analysts it had a lot of ""tech and capability building blocks"" to approach the metaverse opportunity, but did not go into details. read more

Summary Companies Standard Chartered soars after Q1 beat

Auto stocks lifted by Volvo Cars' profit beat

German inflation rises more than expected

U.S. growth likely restrained in Q1 - advance report















April 28 (Reuters) - European shares moved further off six-week lows hit last session as forecast-beating results from companies including energy major TotalEnergies and automaker Volvo Car helped set aside worries about slowing global economic growth.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index (.STOXX) closed up 0.6%, but was below session highs, hit by weak advance first quarter U.S. economic growth data as well as higher-than-expected German inflation spurring bets on a quicker pace of monetary tightening by the European Central Bank. read more

""Softer GDP numbers has raised fears that the U.S. economy is not as immune to the global headwinds that are blowing as was previously thought,"" said Stuart Cole, head macro economist at Equiti Capital.

""It has been enough to see European stocks giving up some of their gains as overall the U.S. figures have simply raised again worries over a global slowdown,"" he said. ""It is another piece of bad news against a backdrop of bad news generally.""

April has been a volatile ride for stock markets globally, with the STOXX 600 sinking to an over one-month low at one point on concerns over rising interest rates, valuations of U.S. technology firms, the Ukraine conflict and China's COVID lockdowns.

But strong earnings saw the index rise on the day, with France's TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA) gaining 3.7% following plans to buy back its own shares after core earnings rose sharply on soaring oil and gas prices. read more

Automakers (.SXAP) rallied 2.2%. Volvo Cars (VOLCARb.ST) jumped 8% after its profit beat analysts' forecasts as demand for its products remained strong. read more

Standard Chartered (STAN.L) jumped 14.2% after reporting upbeat quarterly earnings. read more

""The earnings season so far has been pretty supportive for corporates. It generally seems that they're able to continue to push through some of the costs through pricing,"" said Roger Jones, head of equities at London & Capital.

""But if there is a growth slowdown in the pipeline... how long (earnings strength) will persist is a very big question.""

Of the 23% of STOXX 600 companies that have reported so far, 65% have topped earnings estimates, as per Refinitiv IBES data. In a typical quarter, 52% beat forecasts.

Tech stocks (.SX8P) got a boost from better-than-expected results from Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) as well as a 17.5% surge in software specialist Temenos (TEMN.S) after a report on a possible takeover approach.

Healthcare stocks (.SXDP) took a hit, with Sanofi (SASY.PA) sliding 0.9% even as quarterly profit topped estimates. read more

Swedish cloud communications company Sinch (SINCH.ST) plunged 21.9% as its first-quarter update revealed weak operational trends.

738,META,2022-11-28,UK ditches ban on 'legal but harmful' online content in favour of free speech,"Summary

Summary Companies 'Legal but harmful' element of online safety bill dropped

Social media companies will have to strengthen age checks

Companies could be fined if they fail to tackle illegal content















LONDON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Britain will not force tech giants to remove content that is ""legal but harmful"" from their platforms after campaigners and lawmakers raised concerns that the move could curtail free speech, the government said.

Online safety laws would instead focus on the protection of children and on ensuring companies removed content that was illegal or prohibited in their terms of service, it said, adding that it would not specify what legal content should be censored.

Britain, like the European Union and other countries, has been grappling to protect social media users, and in particular children, from harmful content without damaging free speech.

Digital Secretary Michelle Donelan said rather than watering down the bill, she had strengthened protection for children by making companies enforce the age limits they had already set.

""Companies can't just say 'yes we only allow children over 13 to join our platform', then they allow 10-year-olds and actively promote it to them,"" she told BBC radio. ""We're stopping that from happening.""

She said companies could face fines of up to 10% of their turnover if they did not have systems in place to restrict underage access.

Britain had previously said social media companies could be fined if they failed to stamp out harmful content such as abuse even if it fell below the criminal threshold, while senior managers could have also faced criminal action.

Donelan said the ""harmful but legal"" provision, which had been opposed by some lawmakers and had delayed progress of the legislation, would have had ""unintended consequences"" and eroded free speech.

The government said removing it would also avoid the risk of platforms taking down legitimate posts to avoid sanctions.

The new iteration goes further to protect free speech by stopping companies, such as Facebook-owner Meta and Twitter, removing content or suspending or banning users where there is no breach of their terms of service or the law.

FREE PASS

The opposition Labour Party said replacing the ""prevention of harm"" with an emphasis on free speech undermined the bill's purpose.

""Removing 'legal but harmful' gives a free pass to abusers and takes the public for a ride,"" said Lucy Powell, Labour's culture spokesperson. ""The government has bowed to vested interests, over keeping users and consumers safe.""

The government, however, said the bill, which returns to parliament next month, put the onus on tech companies to take down material that was illegal or was in breach of their own terms of service.

If users were likely to encounter controversial content such as the glorification of eating disorders, racism, anti-Semitism or misogyny not meeting the criminal threshold, the platform would have to offer tools to help avoid it, it said.

Donelan said specific types of harmful material could also be outlawed, compelling social media companies to tackle it or face large fines.

""We all agree that stuff should be illegal, let's make it illegal,"" she told BBC News, adding that the government had already pledged to make the promotion of self harm unlawful.

Summary Companies Barclays dips after profit miss, banks down

CMC Markets slumps on cost warning

FTSE 100 flat, FTSE 250 adds 1.1%















July 28 (Reuters) - The UK's FTSE 100 was subdued on Thursday as mixed earnings and worries about the economic outlook outweighed relief following the U.S. Federal Reserve's less hawkish comments that had spurred an overnight rally on Wall Street.

The blue-chip index (.FTSE) closed flat at 7,345.25 points after notching a seven-week intraday high earlier in the session, while the domestically focused midcap index (.FTMC) added 1.1%.

Banks (.FTNMX301010) weighed on Britain's benchmark index, down 2.3%, with Barclays (BARC.L) losing 4.6% after the lender's first-half profit fell more than expected due to a 1.9 billion pound ($2.3 billion) hit for regulatory missteps. read more

Markets had taken some comfort earlier after the Fed on Wednesday raised interest rates as expected and eased some concerns over the pace of future rate hikes, but gloomy forecasts from Meta and Qualcomm and an early reading showing the U.S. economy contracted again quickly soured sentiment.

""We really need to look at growth data and earnings and I do think the momentum there is somewhat slower ... that's why we're not chasing this rally and maintaining a defensive stance,"" said Willem Sels, HSBC's global chief investment officer for private banking and wealth.

Britain's economy is under strain from an inflation rate that is heading for double digits, leaving the Bank of England in a dilemma about how aggressively it should raise interest rates at its August policy meeting next week.

""We expect the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to step up its fight against high inflation at its meeting,"" Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note.

""The MPC may imply that it is willing to raise rates by 50bps at future meetings if there are no signs that domestic price pressures are easing.""

740,META,2023-03-06,Amazon expansion collides with contraction,"













NEW YORK, March 6 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Amazon.com’s (AMZN.O) rapid expansion is hitting a wall. The e-commerce giant is pausing building out its second headquarters in Arlington, Virginia more than five years after cities from Newark, New Jersey to Dallas, Texas courted the $1 trillion technology company with dog and pony shows and chunky incentives. The fate of HQ2 depends on both the labor market and work-from-home mandates. When it comes to those trends, even Amazon can’t be too sure.

The company said on Friday it is delaying construction on the second phase of the Washington suburb compound as it evaluates space to make sure it fits business needs. Already 2.1 million square feet is built with 8,000 employees and the capacity to put another 6,000 in the building. Over the long term, the plans are to hire 25,000.

Yet Amazon has run head long into a conundrum: It bulked up just as a massive overhaul in both the technology sector and the workforce started to take shape. In 2018 when Amazon awarded Arlington the contract out of more than 230 cities in North America competing for the honor, the company counted some 648,000 full-time and part-time workers. Though its rank and file has more than doubled since then, top line growth has slowed from roughly 30% in 2018 to 10% in 2022. The company’s operating profit margin has fallen from 5.3% in 2018 to 2.3% last year, forcing the company to announce a 6% reduction of the workforce in January.

Amazon Chief Executive Andy Jassy said last month he wanted the troops back in the office, but as recently as September he was flexible with working arrangements. It suggests that either Jassy is unsure about how many employees he will have, or how many will come into the office, or both. That’s a common theme among tech firms. Meta Platforms (META.O) for instance is reducing its footprint in New York City’s Hudson Yards and elsewhere to address cuts and the preference to work from home. But when it comes to the intersection of hiring and work-from-home trends, even Amazon doesn’t have a crystal ball.

Amazon.com is pausing the construction of its next phase of its second headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, the company said on March 3.

In 2018, Amazon awarded the Washington suburb with the promise to invest $2.5 billion and hire 25,000 workers.

Amazon’s Vice President of World Wide Real Estate and Facilities John Schoettler said in a statement, “We’re always evaluating space plans to make sure they fit our business needs and to create a great experience for employees.”

741,META,2022-12-06,Disney’s board needs some magic,"













NEW YORK, Dec 6 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Bob Iger has a knack for head-faking his way out the door. Last month he returned to lead Walt Disney (DIS.N) with a primary task: find a replacement. Keeping him on point is going to require a stronger board.

Iger served as chief executive of the $175 billion media giant from 2005 until 2020. He, like all CEOs, was meant to groom a successor. Instead, he postponed his exit four times as potential replacements Tom Staggs and Kevin Mayer left the building. The job ultimately went to Bob Chapek, who had oversight of the theme parks under Iger. Chapek’s tenure was short, marred by widening operating losses at Disney+ and some high-profile public spats.

Iger in some ways is a fine enough interim choice. Since settling in the C-suite on Nov. 21, Disney added over $7 billion to its market value. Still, the relative performance during his previous tenure doesn’t lend confidence to where Disney needs to go. The company’s stock increased nearly sixfold when he was around, multiples more than the S&P 500 Index. But returns pale in comparison to the likes of Netflix (NFLX.O).

The worry is that Iger will drag his feet again, and no one is around to hurry him along. Eight out of 11 directors – excluding Iger – were appointed during Iger’s first term as the company’s leader. It includes Mary Barra, the boss of General Motors (GM.N) and Nike (NKE.N) Chairman Mark Parker. Susan Arnold, a former executive at Carlyle (CG.O), has served on the board since 2007. She replaced Iger as chair this year even though she is bumping up against Disney’s corporate governance guidelines for length of service.

Activists are circling. Third Point’s Dan Loeb struck a standstill agreement in September after Meta Platforms (META.O) executive Carolyn Everson was named director. Nelson Peltz also has a stake, according to the Wall Street Journal. They could agitate for further changes including nominating directors with media expertise. Only Everson and Iger have that qualification.

That stands in contrast to Netflix’s board, where more than half of the directors come from the entertainment sector including former Disney executive Anne Sweeney. Some fresh talent is coming off Twitter’s board, and potential CEO candidates like Salesforce (CRM.N) ex-boss Bret Taylor are kicking around. A refresh gives Disney its best shot at finally finding the next big cheese to take over the House of Mouse.

742,META,2023-01-05,Hong Kong’s hamsters sound shrill warning,"













HONG KONG, Jan 5 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Almost a year to the day since Hong Kong culled 2,000 hamsters to combat Covid-19, the city is rescinding a ban on importing the creatures for sale, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. The rodents’ return is a small but welcome landmark in its gradual reopening. Yet the metropolis continues to suffer from extreme pandemic policies, which together with Covid-19 destroyed some $27 billion in potential economic growth over the past three years, according to Natixis.

Imported hamsters must still test negative for the virus before they can be sold. It’s not just jet-setting pets; human arrivals are required to test before boarding a flight, even though China objects to similar measures for its citizens elsewhere. Masks remain de rigueur, with no plans to end requirements to wear them in many public venues. Other stringent measures, such as shortened school days and daily tests for students, will continue for weeks yet.

There has been progress. Vaccination rates rose to over 90% from 70% in the past year, and authorities ditched both quarantine and their “Leave Home Safe” tracking app. As Hong Kong prepares to start reopening the mainland border next week, the city needs to cure lingering, illogical bureaucracy, which will hamper urgent efforts to heal the economy, and resurrect normal life.

743,META,2023-01-24,Microsoft’s revenue sniffles are tech’s flu,"













NEW YORK, Jan 24 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Microsoft’s (MSFT.O) revenue growth rarely falters. So its 2% increase in the latest quarter, the slowest in over five years, is alarming. Customers who overinvested during the pandemic are now retrenching, even on Microsoft’s staples. It’s a poor omen for firms built on more discretionary offerings.

The astonishing $1.8 trillion valuation Microsoft sports has a lot to do with how fast, and consistently, it has grown since going public in 1986. Its rolling four-quarter growth has only gone negative twice: once after the Great Recession in 2009 and later when Chief Executive Satya Nadella switched the firm toward subscriptions, which temporarily hit revenue.

Sure, the top line still reached $52.7 billion in the quarter. Microsoft’s productivity software remains standard among office workers. Moreover, companies continue to move more data and applications to Microsoft’s cloud. Its Azure platform grew 31%, a trend that ought to be sustainable for a while yet.

One glitch is that companies, and consumers, invested a lot in technology in recent years in order to work from home. This pulled forward some spending, lowering current growth. Sales of personal computers spiked during the pandemic, but users are unlikely to be buying replacements soon since the typical device lasts several years. Fourth-quarter shipments fell nearly 30%according to market researcher Gartner, the largest decline it has ever recorded. Microsoft’s revenue from computer manufacturers for installing the Windows operating system fell 39%.

More broadly, employers are worried about a slowing, or shrinking, economy. Tech firms in particular are firing significant chunks of their workforce to rein in costs. Fewer office workers mean fewer Microsoft subscriptions. And companies looking to cut costs will delay, or kill, IT projects, which will hit even Microsoft’s fastest-growing units. Azure’s growth was 15 percentage points higher a year ago.

Microsoft’s revenue sniffles, however, probably signal bigger problems for tech firms that sell less essential goods to consumers and firms. If staples like Windows are feeling the chill, advertising budgets, shiny new phones, and telecom gear will be too. Companies like Meta Platforms (META.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) may be in line for a nasty bout of top-line flu.

744,META,2023-03-01,Elliott nominates slate of directors to Salesforce board - source,"













March 1 (Reuters) - Activist investor Elliott Management Corp has nominated a slate of directors to the board of cloud-based software provider Salesforce Inc (CRM.N), a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

The source declined to name Elliott's director candidates or say how many there were.

Elliott said it has been in substantive dialogue with Salesforce leading up to its earnings statement, and ""today's announcements represent progress towards regaining investor trust"".

""The acceleration of margin targets, commitment to responsible capital-return priorities, creation of a business transformation committee and disbanding of the M&A committee are necessary steps forward,"" Elliot said in a statement without making any reference to board nominations.

The steps are consistent with our recommendations, the activist investor said, adding that they will help restore value at Salesforce.

The software provider forecast its first-quarter revenue above analysts' estimates and doubled its share repurchase to $20 billion, indicating a strong cash flow.

Elliott also took an aim at Salesforce's leadership, stating that it required a sustainable plan and a board that would provide accountability through proper oversight.

""To fully earn back the confidence and support of investors, Salesforce leadership must now deliver on its promises.""

The hedge fund said it intends to continue working with Salesforce as they evaluate the ""level of engagement necessary to achieve the best outcome for the company"".

Elliott became the latest activist investor to establish a position in Salesforce when it unveiled its multi-billion dollar stake in January.

Other hedge funds with stakes include Jeff Ubben's Inclusive Capital Partners, Jeff Smith's Starboard Value, ValueAct Capital and Third Point.

Some activists have pushed for the company to increase growth and margins, buy back more shares, and raised concerns about recent acquisitions.

Salesforce could not be reached for comment.

News of the nominations was first reported by CNBC.

To address some of its issues, the company had been working for months to refresh its board and earlier this year added three new directors. These include ValueAct Capital's Chief Executive and Chief Investment Officer Mason Morfit, Mastercard (MA.N) finance chief Sachin Mehra, and former Carnival Corp (CCL.N) CEO Arnold Donald.

Morfit helped to boost Microsoft's market value when he served on the board from 2014 to 2017.

The slate nominated by Elliott signals the pressure such an investor can bring to bear on its target, analysts said, noting that many are using this tool more frequently.

Salesforce, valued at $164 billion, said in January it planned to cut a tenth of its jobs and close some offices after rapid pandemic hiring left it with a bloated workforce.

Tech companies have shed more than 150,000 workers in 2022. Other technology giants such as Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) have also announced job cuts in recent months.

Summary Law firms

Law firms Related documents LA litigator Estrada has represented Facebook, Wells Fargo

Biden U.S. attorney nominees from other large firms include Perkins Coie, Cleary and DLA Piper















(Reuters) - E. Martin Estrada, the nominee to serve as the top federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, earned nearly $4 million from U.S. law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson over the last 15 months, according to an ethics form released on Tuesday as part of his confirmation proceedings.

Estrada, a Munger Tolles litigation and investigations partner in Los Angeles since 2014, disclosed providing legal services to clients including Meta Platforms Inc CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook; Wells Fargo & Co; BNSF Railway Co; Pacific Gas & Electric Co; and The Walt Disney Co.

President Joe Biden nominated Estrada on June 6 to serve as U.S. attorney in the Central District of California, an office Estrada once called home as a federal prosecutor.

Financial disclosures are mandatory filings for many high-level U.S. officials, and they offer a snapshot of compensation from law firms and other employers. Nominees record income earned from the prior year up to the date of the filing.

Estrada did not immediately comment on Tuesday.

Profits per Munger Tolles equity partners were $2.1 million in 2021, according to a March report by industry publication The American Lawyer. More broadly, revenue per lawyer at the 190-lawyer California-founded firm was $1.7 million. U.S. attorneys can make up to about $176,000 annually.

Estrada said on his form he anticipated receiving between $1 million and $5 million this year in compensation, depending on his departure date.

The Central District's U.S. attorney oversees seven offices in counties including Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino. The population of nearly 20 million makes it among the largest of the 93 U.S. attorney offices in the country.

Estrada was a prosecutor in the office from 2007 to 2014, and he served as deputy chief of the violent and organized crime section.

The Trump-era U.S. attorney for Los Angeles, Nicola Hanna, has since returned to the partnership at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. Hanna serves as co-chair of the firm's white-collar defense and investigations group.

An Obama administration U.S. attorney for the office, André Birotte Jr, is now serving as a Los Angeles-based U.S. district court judge.

Biden has turned to law firms including Perkins Coie; DLA Piper; Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton; Hogan Lovells; and McGuireWoods for U.S. attorney nominees. Many other picks have served as career prosecutors.

Summary Law firms Travis LeBlanc is vice chair of firm's cyber, privacy group

Lawyer's clients include Zoom, Coinbase, Twitter and Meta















(Reuters) - A leading cybersecurity partner at Cooley reported receiving nearly $7.5 million in salary and bonus over a two-year period from the U.S. law firm, according to an ethics form released on Thursday as part of his nomination to serve on a federal privacy board.

Travis LeBlanc, whose clients include Coinbase Inc, Meta Platforms Inc and Twitter Inc, was nominated last month U.S. by President Joe Biden to continue his part-time service on the federal Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, which he first joined in 2019.

Financial disclosure forms are mandatory for many U.S. agency nominees and high-level employees, and they offer a window into compensation at law firms and other employers. LeBlanc's report captured income received in 2020 up to the date of his November 2021 filing.

LeBlanc, who works from the California-founded law firm's San Francisco and Washington, D.C., offices, is a member of the firm's litigation department leadership and vice-chair of the cyber, data and privacy group.

Cooley's profits per equity partner reached more than $4 million in 2021, marking a nearly 30% rise over the prior year, according to a March report at industry publication The American Lawyer.

LeBlanc did not immediately reply on Thursday to a request for comment.

He joined Cooley in 2019 from Boies Schiller Flexner, where he was a partner. On an earlier financial disclosure, from 2019, he reported more than $2 million in salary and bonus from that firm.

At Cooley, LeBlanc's other clients included Zoom Video Communications; Chan Zuckerberg Initiative LLC; Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc; Leafly Holdings; and T-Mobile USA Inc.

During the administration of President Barack Obama, LeBlanc served as the Federal Communications Commission's enforcement bureau chief. He earlier served as a senior adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris during her leadership of the California attorney general's office.

The five-member, bipartisan privacy board, created by the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, provides oversight and advice concerning privacy protections and counterterrorism programs.

747,META,2022-04-04,"Facebook, Gibson Dunn face $854K sanctions demand in Cambridge Analytica class action","













(Reuters) - In a newly unsealed sanctions motion in a class action arising from the Cambridge Analytica data-sharing scandal, plaintiffs' lawyers contend that Facebook Inc and its legal team from Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher not only acted in bad faith by delaying crucial discovery but compounded their violations by attempting to blame plaintiffs for the slowdown.

The redacted sanctions motion, originally filed under seal on March 12, seeks about $854,000 in fees and costs from Facebook (now Meta Platforms Inc), Gibson Dunn and Gibson Dunn’s lead partner in the class action, Orin Snyder.

Plaintiffs' lawyers from Keller Rohrback and Bleichmar Fonti & Auld moved for sanctions at the urging of the judge presiding over the class action, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria of San Francisco. At a hearing in February, Chhabria said he had already developed “quite a strong preliminary view” that the company and Gibson Dunn had engaged in sanctionable conduct.

The newly unsealed brief, first spotted by my colleague Mike Scarcella, offers 56 pages of arguments to bolster Chhabria’s supposition. Plaintiffs’ lawyers allege that Facebook’s obfuscation and delay were a deliberate litigation strategy. The company and its lawyers, the brief said, “delayed discovery by slow-walking discovery disputes, obstructing plaintiffs’ requests for relevant evidence, disobeying or distorting court orders and making insubstantial and sometimes frivolous legal arguments.”

Moreover, the plaintiffs allege, Facebook pushed a “false narrative” that any delay was due to unreasonable discovery demands from plaintiffs scrounging for viable claims and trying to expand their case beyond allegations that Facebook improperly shared users’ data without consent. Keller Rohrback and Bleichmar Fonti argued that Facebook’s attempt to shift the blame for seemingly irresolvable discovery disputes was additional proof of its bad faith.

Plaintiffs appear to have a receptive audience in Chhabria. At a March 30 hearing, the judge floated the possibility of simply ruling that adverse inferences may be drawn against Facebook in class certification and summary judgment briefing and at trial. Chhabria even floated the prospect of entering judgment against Facebook as a sanction for discovery delays.

“Let me just ask one question,” the judge said to plaintiffs' lawyer Derek Loeser of Keller Rohrback. “Have there ever been cases where judgment is simply entered against the defendant based on dilatory discovery conduct?”

Loeser's co-counsel, Lesley Weaver of Bleichmar Fonti, responded that case-ending sanctions were “an appropriate remedy for serious discovery abuse,"" citing motions last year for default rulings against Endo International in opioids litigation.

Meta said in an email statement that the sanctions motion ""is not an accurate reflection of the record in this case,"" and that the company is looking forward ""to presenting the complete record to the court."" Gibson Dunn declined to provide a statement. Loeser and Weaver declined to comment on their brief.

Facebook and its lawyers have previously told Chhabria, in hearings and in filings, that the full record will show they have complied with every discovery order issued by Special Master Daniel Garrie and have acted throughout the case in good faith.

At the March 30 hearing, Gibson partner Rosemarie Ring, a recent addition to Facebook’s defense team, repeated those protestations after Chhabria mused about a default judgment. “I truly believe once there's a fuller understanding of what has happened here and how things have unfolded, we will be able to convince you that not only are terminating sanctions not warranted here, but no sanctions are warranted,” she said. Facebook, she noted, has not yet filed its brief responding to plaintiff's assertions.

Chhabria responded that he is looking forward to reading that brief - it's due on April 11 - but warned, “It might be a little bit of an uphill battle based on everything I've learned thus far.”

Plaintiffs’ sanctions motion highlighted alleged discovery abuses in several areas that the judge previously cited as concerns, including Facebook’s assertion of privilege over documents from its internal investigation of data-sharing with other apps and Facebook’s reluctance to produce all of the information it has harvested about the eight named plaintiffs in the prospective class action.

The motion asserts that Facebook improperly insisted it was entitled to privilege over material from the app developer investigation even after U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Corley, who was initially appointed to oversee discovery, ruled that the company could not broadly claim privilege. Facebook’s contrary arguments to the subsequently-appointed special discovery master, Garrie, “were factually baseless and legally frivolous” and “disobeyed” the magistrate’s orders, plaintiffs said.

Plaintiffs also accused Facebook and Gibson Dunn of disregarding a series of orders from Corley and Garrie to produce all of Facebook’s data on the named plaintiffs, even if that data was not shared with app developers. (Plaintiffs allege that the company harvested and shared highly personal and revealing data – such as photos and videos they posted or looked at; information about their relationships, politics and religious views; and even the actual words they used in messages – without users' knowledge or consent.)

“Between them, Judge Corley and Special Master Garrie have issued more than a dozen orders related to the named plaintiffs’ data,” the sanctions motion said. “As of the date of this filing, Facebook has not produced any documents,"" except for information Facebook users can access on their own.

You can be sure that Facebook and Gibson Dunn will tell Chhabria a different story when they file Facebook’s brief on April 11. The most recent case management report in the class action, which was filed soon after the sealed sanctions brief, gives a taste of the company’s defense on the issue of the named plaintiffs' data. The report quotes from a March 9 hearing in which the special master profusely thanked Facebook for providing witnesses and written submissions to explain the complexity of gathering the information sought by plaintiffs. Facebook also said it has turned over everything except for lawyer communications from the internal app developer investigation.

Even Keller Rohrback and Bleichmar Fonti acknowledged in the joint report that Facebook has changed its tone since Chhabria first suggested sanctions in February - but the judge's most recent statements suggest that a mere shift in tone isn’t going to change his mind.

We’ll know in a week what else Facebook and Gibson Dunn have to say.

748,META,2022-07-12,Breakingviews: Twitter may be target for non-Musk deal,"[1/2] The Twitter logo is shown on an LCD screen in front of a displayed stock graph in central Bosnian town of Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in this April 29, 2015 photo illustration.















NEW YORK, July 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elon Musk’s trash may be another person’s treasure. The Tesla boss walked away from his $44 billion agreement to buy Twitter (TWTR.N) on Friday. After the resulting fall in its shares, the social network’s $25 billion valuation is now about fair. If the price continues to fall, other buyers might be interested.

Twitter’s struggle with slowing growth makes it a decent candidate to come off the public market. But Musk was the wrong buyer, offering the wrong price. He swooped in at the start of April, just as a massive rout in technology stocks began. As interest rates continue to go higher and the economy slows, so do company growth rates, especially for technology firms. That, coupled with a higher risk associated with gleaning that growth, means the intrinsic value of Twitter has declined.

That shows in the math Twitter’s own bankers at JPMorgan did to help weigh up Musk’s bid. As part of their valuation exercise, they assumed Twitter’s cash flow would grow at a rate of 6% annually from 2028 onwards. They also turned that into a present-day sum by using a discount rate of around 10%. Now, with rates rising, both of those look optimistic. Cut the growth rate down to 4% and notch the discount rate up to 11%, the shares would be worth $32 each, roughly where they traded on Monday.

Another way of sizing Twitter up is to take its estimated EBITDA for 2023 per Refinitiv estimates, and put it on the same multiple as Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Meta Platforms (META.O), Pinterest (PINS.N), and Snap (SNAP.N). Based on that median of around 13 times, Twitter’s enterprise value would be around $23 billion. Add its roughly $1 billion of net cash and divide by the number of shares outstanding, and the result is roughly the same – around $32 apiece.

Since Musk has walked away from buying Twitter, its shares have fallen about 10%. That makes them almost undervalued, if not quite yet. Paul Singer’s Elliott Management was formerly a big investor in Twitter, and Silver Lake’s Egon Durban sits on the company’s board of directors. Musk may be tossing Twitter to the curb, but that just makes room for a non-Musk deal.

Summary Companies Nonfarm payrolls beat expectations in July

Lyft surges after reporting record earnings

Indexes close: S&P 500 -0.16%, Nasdaq -0.50%, Dow +0.23%















Aug 5 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended lower on Friday, weighed down by Tesla and other technology-related stocks after a solid jobs report torpedoed recent optimism that the Federal Reserve might let up its aggressive campaign to reign in decades-high inflation.

Data showed U.S. employers hired far more workers than expected in July, the 19th straight month of payrolls expansion, with the unemployment rate falling to a pre-pandemic low of 3.5%. read more

The report added to recent data painting an upbeat picture of the world's largest economy after it contracted in the first half of the year. That deflated investors' expectations that the Fed might let up in its series of rate hikes aimed at cooling the economy.

""This is all about the Fed. A very strong jobs report like we had puts pressure on the Fed to tighten for longer,"" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of 50 Park Investments. ""The market is scared the Fed is going to overshoot again. If they tighten too sharply and too long, that's going to cause a hard landing, a deep recession.""

Tesla (TSLA.O) tumbled 6.6% and weighed heavily on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (META.O) lost 2% and Amazon (AMZN.O) fell 1.2%, also pulling down the index.

U.S. Treasury yields climbed as odds increased of a 75-basis-point interest rate hike in September. That helped bank stocks, with JPMorgan (JPM.N) rising 3%, and helping the Dow Jones Industrial Average stay in positive territory.

Focus now shifts to inflation data due next week, with U.S. annual consumer prices expected to jump by 8.7% in July after a 9.1% rise in June.

Several policymakers have this week stuck to an aggressive policy tightening stance until they see strong and long-lasting evidence that inflation was trending toward the Fed's 2% goal.

Surging inflation, the war in Ukraine, Europe's energy crisis and COVID-19 flare-ups in China have rattled investors this year.

A largely upbeat second-quarter earnings season has helped the S&P 500 bounce back by about 13% from its mid-June lows after a rough first-half performance.

The S&P 500 declined 0.16% to end the session at 4,145.19 points.

The Nasdaq declined 0.50% to 12,657.56 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.23% to 32,803.47 points.

For the week, the S&P 500 rose 0.4%, the Dow fell 0.1% and the Nasdaq added 2.2%.

Lyft Inc (LYFT.O) surged almost 17% after the ride-hailing firm forecast an adjusted operating profit of $1 billion for 2024 after posting record quarterly earnings. read more

Advancing issues outnumbered falling ones within the S&P 500 (.AD.SPX) by a 1.3-to-1 ratio.

The S&P 500 posted four new highs and 30 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 60 new highs and 38 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was relatively light, with 10.6 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 10.8 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.

750,META,2023-03-07,Morning Bid: Don't fight central banks,"













A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Anshuman Daga

Judging by the improved mood in global equity markets, investors are once again having a go at central banks.

Despite a slew of data from around the world showing stronger-than-expected performance in economies and labour markets - red signals for inflation - equities are on the mend.

MSCI's world index of global shares has recovered more than 2% this month after slipping 3% in February and erasing a huge chunk of January's 7% gain.

On Tuesday, Asian equity markets ticked up but the main focus of investors will be Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's testimony before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Will Powell be able to send a decisive message to markets about the future pace of interest rate increases? That will be what markets zero in on.

Euro zone short-dated government bond yields extended gains and rose to their highest levels in 14 years on Monday after hawkish policy-maker Robert Holzmann called for four further 50-basis-point interest rate increases from the European Central Bank, while 10-year yields steadied.

Fed, ECB and BoE 'terminal rates' rise

The European Central Bank has already raised rates to 2.5%, a 3 percentage point increase since July and essentially promised another half a percentage point increase on March 16.

Investment managers are cautious on European stocks after their outperformance so far this year.

Strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute expect the trend to end as recent data pushes the European Central Bank to raise rates and keep them higher for longer.

While staying underweight on European stocks, it prefers financials, energy, healthcare and consumer discretionary sectors.

And Schroders' analysts are in the camp of those who expect interest rates to be kept on hold by the ECB from March.

Schroders noted in a report that replenishing of gas storage levels and falling energy prices reduce the need to raise rates further but says some of the reduced demand for energy in 2022 was due to mild winter weather and there was no guarantee of a repeat this coming winter.

Adding to more pain in the technology world, thousands of job cuts are in store at Meta Platforms, Bloomberg News reported on Monday, just a few months after the Facebook-parent slashed more than 11,000 people from its workforce.

On the corporate front, Bloomberg News reported that German chemicals distributor Brenntag is considering buying back at least 5% of its shares. This comes when the company is being urged by activist investors to break up and spin off its specialties unit and launch a share buyback programme.

Meanwhile, Australia's central bank raised its cash rate 25 basis points to the highest in more than a decade at 3.60% and said it expects further tightening will be needed to curb inflation.

Key developments that could influence markets on Tuesday:

NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended a three-day winning streak on Wednesday, closing in negative territory as gloomy earnings guidance added to growing fears of a global economic slowdown.

But those fears, along with a smaller-than-expected interest rate hike from the Bank of Canada, continued to feed hopes that the Fed might consider easing the size of its rate hikes after its Nov. 1-2 policy meeting.

Paul Kim, Chief Executive Officer at Simplify ETFs in New York, agrees.

""Central banks are starting to blink,"" Kim said. ""It’s part of the larger trend and supports the pivot narrative.""

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq ended in negative territory, dragged lower by market-leading tech and tech-adjacent companies following results from Microsoft and Alphabet. The blue-chip Dow eked out a nominal gain.

Microsoft and Alphabet shares tanked, falling 7.7% and 9.1%, respectively.

Those downbeat reports brought worries over an impending global economic downturn from simmer to boil, and spread to other high profile megacaps.

Sales of newly constructed U.S. homes plunged in September while mortgage rates hit their highest level in more than two decades, adding to the growing pile of data suggesting a softening economic landscape.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.37 points, or 0.01%, to 31,839.11, the S&P 500 lost 28.51 points, or 0.74%, to 3,830.6 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 228.12 points, or 2.04%, to 10,970.99.

Five of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 ended the session in the red, with communications services and tech were suffering the largest percentage losses.

Third quarter earnings season has shifted into high gear, with 170 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 75% have delivered consensus-beating results, according to Refinitiv.

But they have a low bar to clear. Analysts see aggregate S&P 500 earnings growth of 2.3%, down from 4.5% at the beginning of the month, per Refinitiv.

""There have been pockets of promising corporate earnings announcements this quarter,"" Keator added. ""I don’t think it's necessarily a fait accompli that we’re going to continue to see earnings misses across the board.""

Boeing Co reported a deeper than expected third quarter loss, sending its shares sliding 8.8%.

On the plus side, Visa Inc rose 4.6% in the wake of the consumer credit company's profit beat.

Facebook parent Meta Inc shares fell more than 12% in after-hours trading after posting results.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.71-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.41-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 25 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 113 new highs and 77 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.26 billion shares, compared with the 11.60 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

June 14 (Reuters) - While the S&P 500 confirmed on Monday that it has been in a bear market since January, many of the benchmark's components are in far worse shape following months of fear-driven selling related to rising interest rates and worries about the economy.

The S&P 500's (.SPX) 3.9% drop on Monday was fueled by worries that more aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve could push the economy into a recession. The S&P 500 has now tumbled about 22% since its Jan. 3 record high close, confirming it has been in a bear market since hitting that high. read more

Within the S&P 500, the picture is dire, with the median stock down 27% from its 52-week high, as of Monday's close. Over two thirds of S&P 500 stocks were down more than 20% from their own 52-week highs as of Monday's close.

Within the S&P 500 technology sector index (.SPLRCT), 93% of stocks have fallen 20% or more from their highs, including PayPal Holdings (PYPL.O), which has now tumbled 76% from its record high last July following a 7% drop on Monday.

Previously highly valued growth stocks have been badly punished in recent months by investors worried about the group's vulnerability to rising interest rates.

Among stocks in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary index , down 67% from its high. The cruise ship company's stock slumped more than 10% on Monday.

Within the communication services sector index (.SPLRCL), Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (META.O) has slumped 57% from its 2021 high, and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) has fallen 49%, including a drop of more than 3% on Monday.

With investors dumping streaming services as competition deepens, Netflix (NFLX.O) has been the S&P 500's worst performer in 2022, down 72% year to date.

While investors are laser-focused on the central bank's next interest rate announcement on Wednesday and on worries about a potential recession, the stock market's recent tumble has cooled valuations that in 2020 reached their highest level since the dot-com era.

753,META,2022-05-19,Two major banks expect more pain for U.S. equities,"













LONDON, May 19 (Reuters) - Two major banks expect more pain for the U.S. stock markets after benchmark indexes posted on Wednesday their worst one-day losses in two years.

In a report published on Thursday, Barclays strategists said margins for U.S. companies and their forward earnings were under pressure due to a combination of factors, ranging from severity of China's COVID lockdowns to the war in Ukraine and the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkish stance.

""Given the numerous negative near-term catalysts for the SPX we believe that the risks remain firmly stacked to the downside,"" they said in a note, referring to the S&P 500 (.SPX).

A key drag on the index had been underwhelming results posted in the current earnings season by the high-flying FAANG group - Meta Platforms (FB.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Netflix (NFLX.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) - Barclays said. The weak results had been the largest negative contribution to the broader index in seven years.

Moreover, fiscal stimulus unleashed during the pandemic had resulted in record consumption of goods as consumers spent during lockdowns, Barclays said. This had translated into strong corporate earnings in the past two years.

Now that consumer spending was switching to services, support for earnings would not be so strong.

Separately, Goldman Sachs strategists estimated a 35% probability of the U.S. economy entering a recession in the next two years.

Furthermore, investors' behaviour in the U.S. stock market, rotating out of some categories of shares and into others, suggested they were pricing in even greater odds of a downturn.

The S&P 500 is down more than 18% so far in 2022 and the Nasdaq has fallen about 27%, dragged lower by tumbling growth stocks. Almost two-thirds of S&P 500 stocks are down 20% or more from their 52-week highs, according to Refinitiv data.

Goldman Sachs said that in 12 recessions since World War Two, U.S. stocks had fallen from peak to trough by a median of 24%.

A decline of that magnitude from the January peak would take stocks 11% below current market levels. An average drop from the peak would be 18%.

Dividend futures represented a second market indicator pricing an outcome consistent with recession, the U.S. investment bank's strategists said. Dividend futures implied S&P 500 dividends would fall by nearly 5% in 2023.

In the past 60 years, trailing four-quarter S&P 500 dividends had never fallen on an annual basis outside of a recession, Goldman Sachs said.

Even retail investors, typically contrarian in recent market selloff episodes, are selling, according to data.

Intra-week selling by retail traders was the worst since March 2020, according to JP Morgan. Charles Schwab net assets suffered outflows for the first time since 2020.

755,META,2023-01-24,Factbox: Biden administration continues Trump antitrust focus on tech giants,"













Jan 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department sued Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O) on Tuesday, marking the third antitrust lawsuit filed against a tech giant since the Trump administration kicked off investigations of the platforms and the Biden administration pledged to press on with the probes.

Following are major U.S. government lawsuits and investigations regarding Big Tech.

Google:

The U.S. Justice Department sued Google on Tuesday, accusing the company of abusing its dominance of the digital advertising business and saying Google should be forced to sell its ad manager suite, in the government's latest attempt to slice away a portion of Big Tech's power.

The U.S. Justice Department had previously sued Google in October 2020, accusing the $1 trillion company of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals in search. This case is scheduled to go to trial in September.

Dozens of U.S. states and territories filed a broader version of the Justice Department lawsuit in December 2020. The state complaint accuses Google of abusing its market power to try to make its search engine as dominant inside cars, TVs and speakers as it is in phones. The same judge is hearing both the federal and state lawsuits in D.C. federal court.

Also in 2020, Texas, backed by nine other states, filed a lawsuit against Google, accusing the internet search company of breaking antitrust law in how it runs its online advertising business. The case was moved to New York, to be heard with other, similar cases.

The Justice Department is also probing Google to determine if bundling its Maps product with other Google software illegally stifles competition.

Facebook:

The Federal Trade Commission and a big group of states filed separate lawsuits to ask a court to force Meta Platforms (META.O) to sell WhatsApp and Instagram, saying the social media company used a ""buy or bury"" strategy to snap up rivals and keep smaller competitors at bay. The judge threw out the state lawsuit on the grounds that they had waited too long to bring their case. The states have appealed while the FTC complaint goes forward.

Apple:

The Justice Department has a probe into Apple (AAPL.O) underway, which was revealed in June 2019. It appears to focus on Apple's app store. Some app developers have accused Apple of introducing new products very similar to existing apps created by other developers and sold in the Apple Store, and then trying to banish the older apps from the store because they compete with Apple's new product. Apple says it seeks to have only the highest-quality products in the app store.

Amazon:

In its investigation of Amazon (AMZN.O), the FTC is believed to be probing the inherent conflict of interest of Amazon competing with small sellers on its marketplace platform, including allegations that it used information from sellers on its platform to decide what products it would introduce.

756,META,2023-02-17,Tech giants from Google to TikTok face tougher EU rules,"













BRUSSELS, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Tech giants including Facebook, Google, Twitter and TikTok face stricter online content rules in the European Union due to their huge number of users.

The new rules, known as the Digital Services Act (DSA), classify companies with more than 45 million users as very large online platforms (VLOPs) and require them to do risk management and external and independent auditing.

They will also have to share data with authorities and researchers and adopt a code of conduct.

The European Commission had given online platforms and search engines until Feb. 17 to publish their monthly active users. Those labelled as VLOPs have four months to comply with the rules or risk fines.

Twitter on Thursday said it had 100.9 million average monthly users in the EU, based on an estimation of the last 45 days.

Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) provided one set of numbers based on users' accounts and another set based on signed-out recipients, saying users can access its services whether they sign in to an account or are signed out.

It said the average monthly number of signed-in users totalled 278.6 million at Google Maps, 274.6 million at Google Play, 332 million at Google Search, 74.9 million at Shopping and 401.7 million at YouTube.

Apple (AAPL.O) said only its App Store built for its iPhones, with more than 45 million monthly users, qualified as a very large online platform. But it will also apply the same rules to the App Store for iPads, Mac computers, Apple Watch and TV, and to its Apple Books e-books and podcasts paid subscriptions.

""Apple intends, on an entirely voluntary basis, to align each of the existing versions of the App Store (including those that do not currently meet the VLOP designation threshold) with the existing DSA requirements for VLOPs,"" it said on its site.

Amazon (AMZN.O) said it had more than 45 million users in the EU, while Microsoft (MSFT.O) said its Bing search engine had 107 million average monthly users in the last six months of 2022.

Alibaba Group Holding's (9988.HK) e-commerce site AliExpress said its average monthly active users in the EU was above 45 million from Aug. 1 last year to Jan. 31 this year.

TikTok has 100.9 million average monthly users in the EU based on an estimation of the last 45 days.

Ebay (EBAY.O) said it was below the EU user threshold.

Meta Platforms (META.O) has said it had 255 million average monthly active users on Facebook in the EU and about 250 million average monthly active users on Instagram in the last six months of 2022. Companies will have to report user numbers every six months.

757,META,2022-04-27,"WhatsApp plans cashback for peer transfers, merchant payments in India push-sources","Summary

Summary Companies WhatsApp planning next phase of payments push in India

Company wants to target users with cash rewards-sources

WhatsApp testing incentives for merchant payments-sources

Competition in India's digital payment market heating up















NEW DELHI, April 27 (Reuters) - WhatsApp will within weeks roll out cashback rewards to lure more Indians to its peer-to-peer payments service and is testing similar incentives for merchant payments, two sources said, as the company seeks to compete with rivals including Google.

The latest move comes days after WhatsApp won regulatory approval to more than double its payments offering to 100 million users in India, its biggest market with more than half a billion users overall. read more

WhatsApp will before the end of May launch the cashback offer of up to 33 Indian rupees ($0.40) for transfers users make on its payments service, which allows contacts to send each other funds from within the messenger app, said the sources, who have direct knowledge of the company's plans.

The incentive, spread over three transactions, will be given irrespective of the amount being transferred, even if it is as little as 1 Indian rupee, in what one source described as WhatsApp's ""user acquisition drive.""

The WhatsApp cashback amount may appear small, but Neil Shah, vice president of research at Counterpoint Research, said it would be a ""compelling enough"" reason for users to switch.

""You won't leave money on the table as an Indian,"" Shah said.

In a statement responding to a question from Reuters, WhatsApp said it is ""running a campaign offering cashback incentives in a phased manner to our users as a way to unlock the potential of payments on WhatsApp.""

Separately, in a broader payments push, WhatsApp is testing a programme where it will dole out cashback incentives for users who pay highway tolls and utility and other bills straight from the app, the two sources said.

WhatsApp also wants to test such incentives for those making mobile payments for Reliance Jio, India's biggest telecom operator, the sources said. Reliance is a partner of WhatsApp whose parent Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) in 2020 invested $5.7 billion in the Indian firm's digital arm.

WhatsApp did not comment on these plans, while Reliance didn't respond to a request for comment.

The cashback push comes after WhatsApp in June 2021 conducted an internal study to assess competition in India. Seen by Reuters, the ""Winning from behind on India payments,"" study says ""incentives are among the top sign up reasons for our competitor apps"" in India.

WhatsApp also assessed it needs to go beyond peer-to-peer payments as users use rival apps to make merchant and bill payments which, the study stated, will be a ""more attractive proposition (for users) to switch over"" to WhatsApp.

WhatsApp competes with Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google Pay, Ant Group-backed Paytm (PAYT.NS) and Walmart's (WMT.N) PhonePe in India's crowded digital payments market.

WhatsApp's growth has been hamstrung as India has for months capped the number of users to which it can offer its payments service on fears that opening it to all its users could strain the country's financial infrastructure, Reuters has reported. read more

BRUSSELS, March 24 (Reuters) - Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google, Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Meta (FB.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) may have to change their core business practices in Europe as EU countries and EU lawmakers on Thursday clinched a deal on landmark rules to curb their powers.

France, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said in a tweet that there was a provisional agreement after eight hours of talks.

EU industry chief Thierry Breton said in a tweet that the deal would ensure fair and open digital markets.

""What we want is simple: fair markets also in digital. Large gatekeeper platforms have prevented businesses and consumers from the benefit of competitive digital markets,"" EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, who proposed the rules just over a year ago, said in a statement.

""This means that the time of long antitrust cases, during which the authorities were lagging behind the big tech companies, is over,"" said EU lawmaker Andreas Schwab, who had steered the debate in the European Parliament.

The Digital Markets Act (DMA) sets out rules for online gatekeepers - companies that control data and platform access.

It will cover gatekeepers in online intermediation services, social networks, search engines, operating systems, online advertising services, cloud computing, video-sharing services, web browsers and virtual assistants.

Under the DMA, the tech giants will have to make their messaging services interoperable and provide business users access to their data. Business users would be able to promote competing products and services on a platform and reach deals with customers off the platforms.

The rules prohibit the companies from favoring their own services over rivals' or preventing users from removing pre-installed software or apps.

The DMA will apply to companies with a market capitalisation of 75 billion euros, 7.5 billion euros in annual turnover and at least 45 million monthly users.

Companies face hefty fines up to 10% of their annual global turnover for breaching the rules and as much as 20% for repeat offences.

Apple, which has lobbied intensively against the DMA, reiterated its worries.

""We remain concerned that some provisions of the DMA will create unnecessary privacy and security vulnerabilities for our users while others will prohibit us from charging for intellectual property in which we invest a great deal,"" it said in a statement.

Google, which also cranked up its lobbying in the last year, echoed the same sentiments.

""While we support many of the DMA's ambitions around consumer choice and interoperability, we're worried that some of these rules could reduce innovation and the choice available to Europeans. We'll now take some time to study the final text, talk with the regulator and work out what we need to do to comply,"" it said in a statement.

DAVOS, Switzerland, May 25 (Reuters) - Bright colours and bold logos proudly signal where India has set up base on the main street in Davos this year, as the country trumpets its pro-business and foreign investment drive.

Inside a pavilion on the Swiss Alpine resort's Promenade street beneath an ""India @ Davos 2022"" logo, the federal government served up treats including 'masala chai' tea, 'samosa' snacks and other spicy delicacies.

Clustered around it are six Indian states with their own lounges, housed in what are usually high street shops.

""It's an Indian street, it should be called 'Little India'. It shows the country is open for investments,"" said Samir Saran of India's Observer Research Foundation.

Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal told Reuters that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had suggested bringing states together to showcase unity at the gathering of business and political leaders at the World Economic Forum.

""Investors love this kind of a messaging,"" Goyal said.

While India has long had a presence at the World Economic Forum, several officials and attendees from Asia's third-largest economy said it was not previously so prominent.

At the government's base, food was being prepared by a team of 15 chefs who were flown in from India, along with 450 kilograms of vegetables and local spices, head chef Guru Nathan told Reuters, as people enjoyed a fragrant morning buffet.

""We were asked to keep the spice moderate so that everyone can enjoy (the food),"" Nathan said.

Only a few steps down the road, Indian tech giants Infosys (INFY.NS), Wipro (WIPR.NS) and HCL Technologies (HCLT.NS) have set up their bases close to those of Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google, Meta (FB.O) and Intel (INTC.O).

One state government official put the number of Indian officials attending Davos at more than 100, with scores of company executives and a handful of startups also present. Goyal estimated overall there would be 200 Indian participants.

""We have record numbers from India,"" Sriram Gutta, head of India agenda at the WEF, said.

'NEW REALITY'

Federal ministers have talked about India's economic boom and the opportunities it offers at Davos.

Although Modi's government has often faced criticism from foreign companies for announcing policies which they say are protectionist in nature and favour domestic companies, India recently reported its highest ever foreign direct investment inflow, which hit $83.57 billion in 2021-22.

After engaging regularly with Indian states on subjects such as agriculture technology, drones and electric vehicles, the WEF has gradually increased the number of invitations to them, Gutta said, adding that they ""will continue to gain prominence"".

Even though they are run by different political parties, the states were seeking to project a united image and showcase their respective offerings for businesses, Deepak Bagla, CEO of federal investment promotion arm Invest India, told Reuters.

The southern state of Andhra Pradesh signed investment pacts worth a total of $16 billion for investment in renewables at Davos, while one official said Karnataka has held meetings with prospective investors. read more

""What this street really shows you is the new reality of India,"" Bagla said.

760,META,2022-12-29,Boardrooms will rediscover the value of gray hair,"













NEW YORK, Dec 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - When opening an office in a new country, it helps to install an executive who has lived there. By the same token, as the economy heads for its first real recession in over a decade, there’s value in having employees who have seen it all before. To firms keen to avoid repeating past mistakes, the graying of the Western workforce may not be a bad thing in 2023.

It’s no secret that the labor supply is getting older. More than 180,000 Americans will turn 65 each month in 2023, the highest on record, according to a study from the St. Louis Federal Reserve. People are working longer, too. The share of European over-55s in jobs grew to 20% in 2019, from 12% in 2014, according to official data. Retailer Target (TGT.N) scrapped its mandatory retirement age of 65 in September; Boeing (BA.N) raised its maximum age to 70 in 2021.

Chief executives too are more senior than they were. The typical incoming CEO is 55, a decade older than the average in 2005, according to Crist Kolder Associates. Walt Disney (DIS.N) and Starbucks (SBUX.O) brought back retired bosses Bob Iger and Howard Schultz in 2022, aged 69 and 71 respectively. Bank of America (BAC.N) chief Brian Moynihan says he hopes to keep running the giant U.S. lender until 2030, by which time he will be 70 and will have held the role for 20 years.

There’s a fine line between prizing expertise and entrenching boomer privilege. But fresh-faced innovators made a particularly poor showing in 2022. The poster child for exuberance over experience is likely to be 30-year-old Sam Bankman-Fried, whose cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapsed in spectacular fashion in November, leaving billions of dollars of customers’ money unaccounted for and financial backers like Sequoia Capital in the doghouse. Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison, while Meta Platforms (META.O), run by fellow millennial Mark Zuckerberg, burned more than $582 billion of shareholder value.

In 2023, experience ought to be at a premium as low inflation and bull markets end. Money markets are pricing in U.S. rates of 5% by the summer. Last time they hit that level in 2007, fintech wasn’t a word, and one-third of today’s U.S. workforce was 19 or younger. Wall Street firms may therefore temper their appetite for digital natives, and bosses will find shareholders more tolerant of long tenure. The flip side is that as the market turns, youthful entrepreneurs may find themselves shunned, at least for a while. Financial markets will always love the next new thing, but for the time being, gray is good.

761,META,2023-02-09,Fear of complacency costs Alphabet $150 billion,"













NEW YORK, Feb 9 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Alphabet’s (GOOGL.O) new chatbot played a little trick this week. The artificial intelligence program made a mistake when answering a question, and a big unveiling of new AI features for search on Wednesday fell flat. The market wiped about $150 billion off the $1.2 trillion company’s market capitalization as a result. That’s probably an overreaction, but any perception Google has become complacent could be hard to shake.

Google had been testing out its bot for a bit, and just as it was presenting on Wednesday, a Reuters story revealed that a question it answered in an advertisement was erroneous. That, plus an underwhelming launch, sent the stock down 11% between Tuesday night and Thursday morning trading. A day earlier, rival Microsoft (MSFT.O) unveiled and released a version of its search engine loaded with AI that can answer complex questions using multiple sources of information.

Microsoft, no small competitor, hopes being better will result in a more competitive search market. Chief Executive Satya Nadella said the gross margin in that industry will drop forever in an interview with the Financial Times. If he’s right, Alphabet has an existential problem. Gross margin was 55% last year, pulling in $157 billion. Cut this figure in half, and Alphabet’s earnings could disappear without serious cost cutting.

Still, a disruptive and successful launch of AI in search is at this point theoretical, and Alphabet’s business is secure for now. It dominates, with over a 90% share of search globally, according to Statcounter. Good technology is a proven disruptor, but incumbency has long had strong advantages. Habits die hard, customers are lazy, and costs to switch are high. Google, Microsoft, Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O) still control their respective niches.

Perceived threats are harder to shake. Microsoft knows this well. In the decade before Nadella become chief executive in 2014, earnings more than doubled. Yet investors worried Microsoft was more concerned with squeezing customers than beating back online competitors. The firm’s earnings multiple was cut in half to about 10. The shares barely moved for a decade, until Nadella’s cloud services push changed the narrative.

Since then, Microsoft’s stock has increased dramatically – shares are worth 10 times more than in 2004. A lull might not be so bad at Alphabet if it ultimately had the same outcome, but for shareholders, the uncertainty is painful.

CONTEXT NEWS

Alphabet’s stock fell over 7% on Feb. 8 and was down over 4% on the morning of Feb. 9 as of 11 a.m. ET (4 p.m. GMT) after an underwhelming reveal of its new plans for using artificial intelligence. Just as the company was presenting its new AI features for search, Reuters reported that an advertisement it had made for a related AI-powered bot named Bard gave a misleading answer to a question. The machine said the James Web Space Telescope took the very first picture of an exoplanet. A European satellite took the first picture 18 years earlier.

On Feb. 7, Microsoft held an event that unveiled new versions of its search engine and web browser that incorporate artificial intelligence. The company has released a version of its Bing search engine using the technology.

762,META,2022-06-24,Job losses add turbulence to Fed’s softish landing,"













WASHINGTON, June 24 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The Federal Reserve may be underestimating the price to pay for taming inflation. The U.S. central bank projects the trade-off for lowering the rate of rising prices is unemployment increasing to 4.1% in 2024. Yet it reckons the economy will still grow.

The Fed has been caught off guard by persistent inflation. The latest surprise was the U.S. consumer price index rising by 8.6% in May, a new 40-year high. That was one reason the central bank last week raised interest rates by 0.75 percentage points.

Chair Jay Powell’s goal of a softish landing for the economy faces bumps. The Fed estimates it will more than double current rates to 3.8% to limit price increases to an acceptable level of 2.2% in 2024. Unemployment forecasts imply the loss of about 1 million jobs. Yet the Fed projects GDP growth in that same year of 1.9%.

Taming inflation could prove more painful. America’s tight labor market has been key to strong consumer spending, the main driver of GDP growth. While Americans are feeling down about the economy, 71% said it’s a good time to find a quality job, according to a recent Gallup poll. That helped spur a more than 10% jump in spending in the first quarter of this year.

Job losses could therefore dampen consumer confidence. A slew of companies, including Silicon Valley giants like Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META.O), have already announced layoffs or a slowdown in hiring. Crypto exchange Coinbase Global (COIN.O) said it would let go of about 1,100 workers while electric-vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA.O) is doing the same for 10% of its salaried staff.

The loss of white-collar jobs is especially damaging to the economy. The top 10% of U.S. households by income, which earn at least $200,000 a year according to census figures, make up almost half of consumer spending.

All this assumes the Fed is right about interest rates. But a good chunk of investors think the central bank will blow past its 3.4% median projection for rates by the end of this year, according to CME’s FedWatch tool.

Steeper rate hikes could further shake up bonds, with the ICE BofA Treasury Index already down 10% this year. Lower spending would further weigh on corporate earnings and stocks. There’s more unexpected turbulence in the Fed’s softish landing plans.

The U.S. Federal Reserve could raise interest rates to 3.8% by the end of 2023 to curb inflation, compared to the current rate that tops out at 1.75%, according to the central bank’s median projections released on June 15.

The central bank estimates that inflation will fall to 2.2% in 2024 when the unemployment rate will rise to 4.1%. The jobless rate in May 2022 was 3.6%.

763,META,2022-07-09,Breakingviews: Musk lit a fire Twitter didn’t know it needed,"













WASHINGTON, July 8 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elon Musk started a fire under Twitter (TWTR.N) when he offered to buy the social network for $44 billion in April. Even though he’s now walking away from the deal, Twitter chief Parag Agrawal can ensure the heat doesn’t die out altogether.

Musk’s lawyer said on Friday that Twitter had breached the terms of its agreement, by not handing the Tesla (TSLA.O) boss data he said he needed to size up the social media firm’s fake-user problem. Predictably, Twitter’s board is threatening to hold him to his promises in court. While it can theoretically try to force Musk to consummate the deal, it may settle for a few billion dollars instead.

The deal was, in any case, riddled with problems from the moment Musk revealed his 9% stake in Twitter in April. He wanted to be on the company’s board, and then didn’t. Then he made a bid to buy the company, only to get cold feet read more , which started to weigh on Twitter’s shares. On Friday in after-market trading, the company’s shares were 11% below their level before Musk revealed his investment. They probably have further to fall now, since the Nasdaq 100 index is down around 20% over that time.

Twitter too handled the situation poorly. The board, run by independent chair Bret Taylor and featuring co-founder Jack Dorsey, didn’t take time to shop the company around, or discuss separating some potentially conflicted members from discussions. The deal it agreed allowed Musk to walk away with a relatively low break fee of $1 billion, albeit with other clauses that could restrict him.

Whatever happens, Twitter can thank Musk for pointing out some flaws in its business. It does indeed have fake users, and low operating margins compared to companies like Facebook owner Meta Platforms . Agrawal could trim research and development, which eats up more than half of the company’s gross income, according to Refinitiv, yet hasn’t delivered any major product innovations. He could consider testing out more subscription services, something Musk proposed.

If another bidder arises, Twitter may be more efficient, more highly valued, and better prepared to run a proper process. And any other company that gets a hastily composed takeover approach from Elon Musk will be better prepared to send him packing.

764,META,2022-05-24,Snap! Elon Musk has another Twitter excuse,"













NEW YORK, May 24 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Snap (SNAP.N) could be Twitter’s (TWTR.N) raven. The disappearing-message app abruptly slashed its second-quarter forecasts, sending its shares spiraling some 40%. That’s an ominous sign for Twitter. Elon Musk has an additional reason to bail on buying the social media network.

Snap’s admission late on Monday that the economy was deteriorating faster than anticipated came as a shock. Last month, the company run by Evan Spiegel was expecting its revenue to increase between 20% and 25% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA to break even at worst. Snap now expects its top line and profit to undershoot its guidance range.

The warning pulled down other firms dependent on digital advertising. Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (FB.O) shed $50 billion of market value; Google’s parent, Alphabet (GOOGL.O), lost nearly $60 billion. But the two technology titans are on firmer footing, with a wider variety of customers and less exposure to a few big brands. For instance, Facebook and Instagram attract advertising revenue from small businesses while Google hoovers up search ads.

Twitter, however, is a similar breed to Snap, feeding from the same revenue stream of brand advertisers. More problematically, Snap is growing faster: During the first quarter, its revenue increased 38% year-over-year to $1 billion, while daily active users rose 18% compared to the year-ago quarter to 332 million. By contrast, Twitter’s top line is growing at half Snap’s pace. And it had to recast its total active user numbers because of overcounting. Twitter boss Parag Agrawal is not giving an outlook pending Musk’s $44 billion acquisition.

That deal is already on shaky ground. The Tesla chief executive is stalling his offer while he waits for Agrawal to cough up additional data on fake accounts. Shares of Twitter, which fell 4% on Tuesday to around $36, are well below Musk’s $54.20 offer, implying approximately a 30% chance of the deal closing, according to a Breakingviews calculation. Musk could always walk away too. Snap may have handed him another excuse.

WASHINGTON, July 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Twitter (TWTR.N) and Snap share some common problems. If they’re smart, they could share much more, as merger partners - provided Twitter can tie up its loose ends with fickle suitor Elon Musk read more .

Twitter reported a surprising decline in second-quarter revenue on Friday, even though the U.S. economy hasn’t yet fully hit the brakes. Its revenue shrank 1% to $1.2 billion, which it blamed on advertisers worrying about a potential recession. Snap had a similar experience. The disappearing message app missed the second-quarter revenue forecast it had already cut in May.

Both are still succeeding in pleasing the masses. Twitter’s average monetizable daily active users grew at a decent 17% to almost 240 million. Snap’s daily active user base increased 18% to 347 million. But separately they’re too small to woo advertisers the way that rivals like Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Meta Platforms can. Twitter is also struggling to steady the ship in the wake of its sale to Musk for $44 billion, a merger which has now descended into legal acrimony after the Tesla boss got cold feet.

What if the two flocked together? Merging Twitter and Snap, which offer complementary products, would allow them to pool their spending power, especially if they can cut ballooning costs. Together they would have about $11 billion in cash and cash-like investments; still less than Meta’s $45 billion in the first quarter, but enough to have a fighting chance. Twitter could add to its cash pile by striking a settlement with Musk.

The timing is also favorable. At its peak last year, Snap read more had a market capitalization of more than $120 billion, far higher than Twitter’s. But its pandemic gloss has rubbed off. The firm co-founded by Evan Spiegel was worth around $16 billion on Friday, whereas Twitter, even after a slight post-earnings fall, was worth $30 billion. Spiegel controls Snap’s shareholder votes, but that could be an advantage: Offer him the chance to run the whole merged company, and it might reduce the premium Twitter would have to pay. He may also be a more effective leader than Twitter’s new, relatively unproven Chief Executive Parag Agrawal.

It wouldn’t be the first time a failed takeover has turned into a better one. Think of telecoms firm T-Mobile US (TMUS.O), which got a $6 billion payout in cash and spectrum from rival AT&T (T.N) as compensation for their nixed merger, and later bought Sprint. Twitter could do something similar: feather its nest with some of Musk’s cash, and then lure a more suitable mate.

766,META,2023-01-12,"At Walt Disney, the G in ESG stands for goofy","













NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - It’s sadly fitting that Walt Disney (DIS.N) persists with Mickey Mouse corporate governance. The $176 billion entertainment empire on Wednesday appointed Nike (NKE.N) Chairman Mark Parker to run its board, too. He is also being tasked with finding yet another successor for Chief Executive Bob Iger. And he’ll be squaring off with pushy investor Nelson Peltz. The silly drama never ends.

In November, Disney abruptly ousted Bob Chapek shortly after giving him a new three-year deal to reign over the Magic Kingdom and brought Iger out of retirement. Parker, who has been a director at Disney since 2016, was around for all of it. It makes him an odd choice to put in charge of rectifying the mismanaged transition in which he played a role.

The board’s clumsy decisions go even further. Parker is filling the chair’s seat being vacated by Susan Arnold. She was put at the head of the table at the end of 2021 and is leaving now because her 15 years of directorship tenure are up under Disney’s rules. It begs the question of why, if Parker makes so much sense now, he didn’t a year ago, to preempt another disruptive changeover.

This sort of disorder only fuels unhappy shareholders. After fending off Third Point’s Dan Loeb, who struck an agreement with Disney following the company's addition of the former Meta Platforms (META.O) executive Carolyn Everson to the board, Disney now will have to tangle with Peltz’s Trian. After unsuccessfully haggling with Iger, he is starting a proxy fight to get himself on the board. Trian cites the poor succession planning, bad judgement on the deal to buy parts of Fox and its struggle with profitability at its streaming services. Disney preempted Peltz’s announcement and urged shareholders not to support him.

Given the many challenges, Parker will be spreading himself thin. Only a handful of executives, including 91-year-old Rupert Murdoch at Fox and News Corp (NWSA.O), chair two S&P 500 companies, according to Equilar. Unless Parker plans to step down at Nike – and the $198 billion shoemaker gave no indication of that happening on Wednesday – shareholders of both companies may get short-changed. At Disney, they’re getting all too used to it.

CONTEXT NEWS

Walt Disney said on Jan. 11 that the board elected Mark Parker to be chairman, effective following the annual meeting of shareholders. Parker has been a Disney director since 2016, and he also serves as executive chairman of Nike.

Parker is replacing Susan Arnold, who took the role on Dec. 31, 2021. She will not stand for re-election because of the Disney board’s 15-year term limit on tenure.

Disney also said that shareholder Trian Partners had nominated founding partner Nelson Peltz to serve on the company’s board. It added that while it has engaged with Peltz “numerous times over the last few months,” the board does not endorse Peltz as a nominee and recommends that shareholders vote against him.

767,META,2022-05-09,SoftBank seen posting bruising Vision Fund loss on tech sell-off,"













TOKYO, May 9 (Reuters) - Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) is set to report a bruising loss at its Vision Fund investment unit on Thursday, analysts said, after investors sold off the high-growth stocks favoured by the fund with questions about their earnings potential.

With the technology investor poised to post full-year earnings, comments from founder and Chief Executive Masayoshi Son about his risk appetite amid rising interest rates and war in Ukraine will also be in focus.

SoftBank has suffered a slump in its China tech assets and saw shares slide in January-March in top portfolio firms DiDi Global Inc (DIDI.N), Grab Holdings Ltd and Coupang Inc .

The conglomerate is also likely to book losses on its unlisted portfolio, analysts said, as weakness in public markets feeds through to private valuations.

""It's hard to see that they can come out of this quarter without writing down private assets,"" said Redex Research analyst Kirk Boodry, who expects Vision Fund to book its deepest-ever loss.

""They might do the same thing they did two years ago and just kitchen sink stuff because they know that markets have built in a bad quarter,"" Boodry said.

The Vision Fund unit posted an $8.9 billion investment loss in the second quarter before bouncing back to an $850 million gain in the third, helped by gains in its private portfolio.

Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics

The unit's $100 billion Vision Fund specialises in big bets on late-stage tech startups, many of which have successfully gone public but are now trading below listing prices.

The $50 billion Vision Fund 2 has invested smaller amounts but has faced high prices for private assets as well as competition from rivals such as Tiger Global, with falling portfolio valuations also squeezing SoftBank's financial leeway.

Lack of visibility on the second fund's portfolio and underperformance of listed assets means the fund is yet to catalyse an upward reevaluation of SoftBank's shares, which trade at a discount to the value of group assets.

SoftBank is prioritising investing through Vision Fund and has wound down its SB Northstar trading arm which racked up personal losses for Son with bets on derivatives and listed stocks such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Facebook, now Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O).

""We believe investment returns from other funds were also weak, including the Latin American fund and SB Northstar,"" Citigroup analyst Mitsunobu Tsuruo wrote in a client note.

SoftBank had around $35 billion in dry powder at December-end and has sold down assets including Coupang and T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O). SoftBank's shares, underpinned by a 1 trillion yen buyback programme, are down 8% year-to-date.

The jewel in Son's investing crown, his stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (9988.HK), is worth around $60 billion after the Chinese e-commerce firm lost about two-thirds of its value since late 2020.

SoftBank is pushing ahead with plans to list chip designer Arm following the collapse of a sale to Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) in an initial public offering that could value the company at as much as $60 billion, Reuters has reported.

Summary

Summary Companies $1.3 trillion fund owns about 1.3% of all listed stocks

H1 return on investment was -14.4%, but ahead of benchmark

All sectors saw lower returns, apart from energy















OSLO, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, made a record loss of 1.68 trillion Norwegian crowns ($174 billion) in the first half of 2022 as stocks and bonds were hit by global recession fears and rampant price inflation.

The $1.3 trillion fund's return on investment was a negative 14.4% for the January-June period, which was still 1.14 percentage points ahead of the return on its benchmark index.

The decline, led by a 28% plunge in the value of its technology stocks, was the largest of any six-month period in the fund's 26-year history, although some losses have since been recovered as markets turned positive in July and August.

""The market has been characterised by rising interest rates, high inflation, and war in Europe,"" Chief Executive Nicolai Tangen of Norges Bank Investment Management, which operates the fund, said in a statement.

Tangen, who last year delivered the fund's second highest profit on record, has repeatedly warned of weak markets ahead and that the fund, which is allowed to deviate only slightly from its benchmark indices, would thus also decline. read more

""This is well within what one can expect,"" Tangen said of the first-half loss.

The biggest loss in its stock portfolio came from Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), where the value of the fund's investment declined by 38 billion crowns, followed by Amazon (AMZN.O) with 35 billion and Apple (AAPL.O) with 30 billion.

After surging while COVID-19 increased demand for online shopping and entertainment, tech and social media stocks have been hit by higher interest rates and competition between platforms for advertising budgets being eaten into by inflation.

Founded in 1996, the sovereign wealth fund invests revenue from Norway's oil and gas sector and holds stakes in more than 9,300 companies globally, owning 1.3% of all listed stocks.

Its $1.3 trillion valuation equates roughly to the size of the Mexican economy, the world's 16th largest, according to some measures.

The fund's biggest percentage loss came in 2008 as the global financial crisis drove down its value by 23% for the full year, although the size of the fund was significantly smaller at the time and the overall loss amounted to 633 billion crowns.

All sectors in which the fund invests recorded negative returns in the first half, apart from energy, where returns were 13% as prices soared following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Central banks have hiked interest rates aggressively this year to combat inflation, leading to increased borrowing costs and lowered profit margins for corporations.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) and the broader S&P 500 index (.SPX) saw their biggest January-June declines since the financial crisis, while U.S. and European government bond markets had their worst start to any year in decades. read more

In total, 68.5% of the fund was invested in equities at the end of June, with 28.3% in fixed income, 3.0% in unlisted real estate and 0.1% in unlisted renewable energy infrastructure.

769,META,2023-02-17,White Castle could face multibillion-dollar judgment in Illinois privacy lawsuit,"













Feb 17 (Reuters) - Illinois' highest court on Friday said companies violate the state's unique biometric privacy law each time they misuse a person's private information, not just the first time, a ruling that could expose businesses to billions of dollars in penalties.

The Illinois Supreme Court in a 4-3 decision said fast food chain White Castle System Inc must face claims that it repeatedly scanned fingerprints of nearly 9,500 employees without their consent, which the company says could cost it more than $17 billion.

The Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) imposes penalties of $1,000 per violation and $5,000 for reckless or intentional violations. The law requires companies to obtain permission before collecting fingerprints, retinal scans and other biometric information from workers and consumers.

White Castle had argued that it could only be sued for initially collecting each worker's fingerprint, and not every time they were scanned to access a company computer system.

The company was backed by a dozen major business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the country's largest business lobby. The Chamber in a brief filed last year said a ruling against White Castle would spur litigation that could be financially ruinous for some companies.

The court on Friday said BIPA broadly prohibits ""collecting"" or ""capturing"" biometric information without consent, and White Castle had to collect workers' fingerprints every time they used the computer system.

A Chicago-based U.S. appeals court had asked the Illinois Supreme Court to decide the issue. The lawsuit against White Castle now goes back to that court to apply Friday's decision.

Ohio-based White Castle in a statement provided by a spokesperson said it was disappointed with the ruling and was considering its options.

James Zouras, a lawyer for the named plaintiff, said the decision means companies cannot shirk their legal obligations to safeguard private information.

""Hopefully, today’s decision will encourage employers and other biometric data collectors to finally start taking the law seriously,"" he said.

Two weeks ago, the Illinois Supreme Court held in a separate case that plaintiffs have five years to sue for violations of BIPA, rejecting a one-year window pushed by business groups.

Together, the two decisions will allow workers and consumers to file lawsuits alleging many more violations of BIPA over a longer period of time. This could potentially lead to billions of dollars in penalties and raises pressure on companies to settle cases.

Nearly 2,000 lawsuits alleging violations of BIPA have been filed since 2017, yielding a series of massive settlements and judgments.

Meta Platforms Inc's Facebook in 2020 agreed to pay $650 million to settle a BIPA class action involving its use of facial recognition software. The company denied wrongdoing.

In October, following the first-ever trial in a BIPA case, a jury ordered BNSF Railway Co to pay $228 million for collecting truck drivers' fingerprints without their consent. The railroad has moved for a new trial.

The case is Cothron v. White Castle System Inc, Illinois Supreme Court, No. 128004.

770,META,2022-05-20,Bear market beckons as stock volatility continues in 2022,"













NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - The stock market's brutal year neared a grim milestone as the S&P 500's slide on Friday threatened to leave it in a bear market for the first time since March 2020, fueled by worries over sky high inflation, a hawkish Federal Reserve and future economic growth.

The benchmark S&P 500 index fell below 3837.248 during Friday's session, a decline that on an intraday basis put it more than 20% below its Jan. 3 record closing high. However, the index closed above that level, and did not confirm it was in a bear market – frequently defined as a drop of at least 20% from a closing high.

If history is any guide, a bear market would mean more pain could be in store for investors. The S&P 500 has fallen by an average of 32.7% in 13 bear markets since 1946, including a nearly 57% drop during the 2007-2009 bear market during the financial crisis, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.

It has taken a little over a year on average for the index to reach its bottom during bear markets, and then roughly another two years to return to its prior high, according to CFRA. Of the 13 bear markets since 1946, the return to breakeven levels has varied, taking as little as three months to as long as 69 months.

Reuters Graphics

The S&P 500 surged some 114% from its March 2020 low as stocks benefited from emergency policies put in place to help stabilize the economy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

That decline went into reverse at the start of 2022 as the Fed grew far more hawkish and signaled it would tighten monetary policy at a faster-than-expected clip to fight surging inflation. It has already raised rates by 75 basis points this year and expectations of more hikes ahead have weighed on stocks and bonds.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has vowed to raise rates as high as needed to kill inflation but also believes policymakers can guide the economy to a so-called soft landing. read more

Adding to the volatility has been the war in Ukraine, which has caused a further spike in oil and other commodity prices.

for bear market story

A few areas of the stock market have been spared. Energy shares have soared this year, along with oil prices, while defensive groups such as utilities have held up better than broader markets.

Reuters Graphics

On the flip side, shares of technology and other high-growth companies have been hit hard. Those stocks -- high fliers during much of the bull market over the past decade -- are particularly sensitive to higher yields, which dull the allure of companies whose cash flows are weighted more in the future and diminished when discounted at higher rates.

Some of the biggest of these companies, such as Tesla (TSLA.O) and Facebook owner Meta Platforms (FB.O), are also heavily weighted in the S&P 500 index.

Investors have looked at various metrics to determine when markets will turn higher, including the Cboe Volatility Index (.VIX), also known as Wall Street’s fear gauge. While the index is elevated compared to its long-term median, it is still below levels reached in previous major selloffs. read more

July 20 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended higher on Wednesday with the tech-heavy Nasdaq booking a 1.6 % gain on positive earnings signals with a wary eye on inflation and more interest rate hikes by the Fed.

Netflix Inc's (NFLX.O) shares added 7.4% after the company predicted it would return to customer growth during the third quarter, while posting a smaller-than-expected 1 million drop in subscribers in the second quarter. read more

Other high-growth stocks extended gains following the forecast from the streaming service provider. Shares of Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) rose between 1% and 4.2%.

Electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) rose 2% in extended trading after reporting a rise in quarterly profit after the bell. read more

“Equity prices are trending in a roller coaster fashion, currently being at the mercy of inflation, interest rates and earnings,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.

“We're going to need another series of reporting cycles to confirm whether or not inflation indeed is getting under control.”

Analysts expect aggregate year-on-year S&P 500 profit to grow 5.9% in this reporting season, down from the 6.8% estimate at the start of the quarter, according to Refinitiv data.

Runaway inflation initially led markets to price in a full 100-basis-point hike in interest rates at the Fed's upcoming meeting next week, until some policymakers signaled a 75-basis-point increase.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 47.79 points, or 0.15%, to 31,874.84, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 23.21 points, or 0.59%, to 3,959.9 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 184.50 points, or 1.58%, to 11,897.65.

Seven of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 gained ground, with consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) and information technology (.SPLRCT)posting the biggest gains.

Trading remained volatile in thin volumes, with the CBOE Volatility index (.VIX) closed at 23.79 points to its lowest in nearly three months.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.51 billion shares, compared with the 11.43 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

""Low volumes accentuate market moves historically and even though we've wiped off $10 or $15 trillion from global equities this year, there's still a lot of excess liquidity. So low volume on excess liquidity can still accentuate moves,"" John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management, said.

Baker Hughes Co tumbled 8.3% as the largest S&P percentage loser, as the oilfield services provider reported a bigger second-quarter loss, while its adjusted profit also missed estimates. read more

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.94-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.28-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.

A brutal week for technology stocks worldwide got even worse on Friday as Amazon became the latest mega-cap to plunge, underscoring recession fears and stoking speculation that central bank tightening has hit a nerve and may soon tone down.

Shares in the world's biggest online retailer (AMZN.O) cratered 15% after the bell on Thursday after the firm forecast a slowdown in sales growth for the holiday season, disappointing Wall Street and warning consumers and businesses had less money to spend.

Although Apple barely managed to avoid the market trapdoor with more soothing earnings, Amazon's slide was the latest hit to a sector hammered this week by worrying updates on the impact from inflation, rate rises, and looming recession.

Meta (META.O) stock crashed almost 25% on Thursday and in China, Hong Kong's tech shares (.HSTECH) have been decimated this week amid fears about the political direction of Beijing's new ruling cabinet.

All of which raises some questions about the price at which Elon Musk eventually agreed to buy Twitter. Musk took ownership of Twitter (TWTR.N) late Thursday, firing top executives immediately but providing little clarity over how to achieve the lofty ambitions he outlined for the social media platform.

Big Oil earnings from Exxon (XOM.N) and others later on Friday are likely to be far stronger that Big Tech - but rumblings of windfall taxes around the world may limit any market positivity.

Major bourses and S&P500 futures were all down about 1%.

Worries from the corporate world about an economic downturn merely fueled talk the U.S. Federal Reserve will downshift its tightening campaign after a fourth straight 75 basis point rate rise next week.

But the dollar rallied on Friday as other central banks looked to more than match any easier Fed tilt. Eyes are shifting to another U.S. inflation update later, with European growth and inflation numbers surprising to the upside.

The Bank of Japan kept ultra-low interest rates and maintained its dovish guidance, cementing its status as an outlier among global central banks tightening monetary policy.

Although spurred back higher on Friday by the inflation news, European bond markets had a dovish take on Thursday's doubling of European Central Bank interest rates to 1.5%. The ECB soundings, mounting demand fears and ebbing energy prices this month have all dragged the implied ECB ""terminal rate"" next year as low as 2.75% from 3%.

Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Friday:

* U.S. September PCE price index, personal income and consumption. Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE Price Index for September, U.S. September pending home sales, University of Michigan October sentiment.

* Italy auctions government bonds

* U.S. Corporate Earnings: Exxon, Chevron, Nextera Energy, Abbvie, Colgate Palmolive, WW Grainger, Newell Brands, DaVita, Charter Communications, Church & Dwight.

HONG KONG, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Asian shares rose on Tuesday as U.S. stocks increased overnight before midterm elections and investors clung on to hopes that China would eventually relax its strict pandemic curbs even after the government reaffirmed its commitment to the zero-COVID policy.

Wall Street ended sharply higher Monday as investors focused on Tuesday's midterm elections that will determine control of Congress, while shares of Meta Platforms jumped on a report of job cuts at the Facebook parent.

MSCI's gauge of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) was up 0.39% at 0134GMT. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index (.HSI) and China's benchmark CSI300 Index (.CSI300) were up 0.3% and 0.14%, respectively.

""Markets are expecting the gridlock situation of a divided Congress and moderation in the U.S. CPI. Both are helping the risk-on sentiments.""

Investors are hoping China will gradually ease its zero-COVID policy and reopen to the world, even after health officials reiterated their commitment to the policy on Saturday at a press conference.

The policy has weighed on China's economic activity, with downbeat trade data on Monday providing the latest sign that the world's second-largest economy is slowing.

""Investors took note (of the fact) that the health officials added that local governments should not unreasonably double down on the implementation and must ensure people’s livelihood and economic activities remain normal,"" Wong added.

774,META,2022-11-18,Falling Q4 profit forecasts another negative for U.S. stocks,"













NEW YORK, Nov 18 (Reuters) - After a disappointing third-quarter reporting period, analysts are projecting that fourth-quarter U.S. earnings will decline for the first time in two years as rising interest rates and slowing growth further dampen the outlook.

Estimates have been falling for 2023 quarters as well, and Goldman Sachs recently cut its 2023 S&P 500 earnings per share growth forecast to zero, citing weakening profit margins.

As of Friday, analysts were forecasting a 0.4% fall in year-over-year fourth-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. That compares with the 5.8% increase they forecast on Oct. 1.

The last time there was a quarterly decline in S&P 500 earnings was in the third quarter of 2020, when companies were still reeling from the initial shock of and disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

The weakening profit outlook only adds to worries for investors, who have been concerned that aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to control inflation could lead to a recession. The S&P 500 (.SPX) is down about 17% for the year-to-date.

""Third-quarter earnings, they missed expectations. But what we've been focusing on really is 2023,"" said Michael Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners in Boston.

""For the Fed to achieve their inflation targets, they're going to have to push the economy into a recession,"" which means 2023 profit estimates ""have to come down a lot more,"" he said.

Technology and tech-related companies have accounted for more than half of the negative S&P 500 profit revisions for the fourth quarter, Jonathan Golub, head of U.S. equity strategy and quantitative research at Credit Suisse, wrote in a recent research note.

Several of the big tech and growth companies including Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META.O) hit investors with big disappointments for the third quarter and gave disappointing forecasts for the fourth quarter.

Rising Treasury yields have pressured shares of tech and growth companies especially hard. read more

Top retailers were also among those reporting disappointing results, led by Target(TGT.N), although Walmart delivered cheer to investors.

With results in from 475 of the S&P 500 companies as of Friday, third-quarter earnings are now estimated to have increased just 4.2% from a year ago. That is weaker than the 4.5% gain predicted at the start of October, based on Refinitiv data.

Estimates for future earnings tend to fall as companies give guidance, but strategists said the declines this time have been larger than usual.

775,META,2022-11-22,Don't like Musk? Work for us! Tech firms woo ex-Twitter staff,"













LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Put off by Elon Musk's muscular management style? Move to us! That's the pitch being used by talent-starved technology firms trying to lure thousands of former Twitter Inc employees laid off by the social media company under its new owner.

Twitter has fired top executives and enforced steep job cuts with little warning following Musk's tumultuous takeover of the social media platform. About half of the workforce - around 3,700 employees - has been laid off.

Hundreds more are reported to have quit as a result of his sweeping reforms. On Monday, the head of French operations was the latest senior manager to leave.

Spying opportunity, some companies are now trying to pick up experienced engineering talent by appealing to their disdain for the methods of the world's richest person.

Katie Burke, chief people officer at U.S. software company Hubspot (HUBS.N), blasted Musk over reports he had fired a group of employees that had criticised him on the company's internal Slack channels. Reuters was not able to verify the reports.

""As a leader, getting criticized is part of your job,"" she wrote in a Linkedin post. ""Great leaders recognize debate and disagreement makes you better and is part of the process. If you want a place where you can disagree (in a kind, clear manner of course) with people, HubSpot is hiring.""

By late on Monday, Burke's post had earned more than 35,000 positive reactions on Linkedin.

Twitter and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.

Other companies are taking a similar approach to Hubspot.

Amanda Richardson, CEO of recruitment software startup CoderPad, published an open letter to Twitter leavers.

Citing Musk's initial ban on remote-working, Richardson described Musk’s takeover as a ""s*** show"" which had been ""terribly frustrating, depressing and demotivating"".

""At CoderPad, we believe your skills say it all. Not where you sit. Not if you sleep at work. Not working 7 days a week for 18 hours a day.""

Other big U.S. tech firms including Meta (META.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) have also laid off thousands of staff in recent weeks due to the uncertain economic environment.

But the public criticism of Musk highlights strong demand in parts of the industry for highly skilled digital workers.

A recent report from market analysis firm Gartner found high attrition rates and a spate of digitalisation efforts across business and government had created a ""hyper-competitive"" market for technical talent.

Mass job cuts and public resignations at Twitter have prompted worries the firm is shedding vital staff and fears the social media ""town square"" could face technical troubles.

Michael Weening, CEO of U.S. cloud and software company Calix (CALX.N), described recent events at Twitter as “disturbing”, and promised new recruits they would enjoy a corporate culture that “starts with our team members” in a similar Linkedin post.

""From our perspective this is a great opportunity, as people who would not speak to us before are disillusioned and looking,"" Weening told Reuters. ""The toxic culture has people saying, ‘No more.’""

776,META,2022-10-17,Exclusive: Short-video company Triller launches metaverse platform,"













Oct 17 (Reuters) - Short-video platform Triller Inc is the latest company to stake its claim in the metaverse with the launch Monday of a new platform called Metaverz.

Triller said its Metaverz provides virtual spaces where users can gather to watch live music and sporting events, such as Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship or the Triller Fight Club, and interact with artists and other fans.

Its first event takes place on Oct. 22 with DJ Sam Feldt performing an electronic set from the Netherlands, then dropping into Metaverz's virtual nightclub as an avatar to mingle with guests. The virtual performance is one of 2,000 events Triller and its subsidiaries plan to host in the next year, a majority of which will happen in the real world and in Metaverz.

""We're carefully curating all our events and experiences so people understand what they're doing,"" Christopher Taurosa, head of Metaverz. ""It's not like you walk around aimlessly ... You get to engage around an event.""

Triller's Metaverz will compete with deeper-resourced rivals like Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), which has spent billions of dollars to create an immersive digital environment where people would socialize, play games and work. Its flagship game, Horizon Worlds, has struggled to gain a firm footing, attracting just 200,000 users, according to documents obtained by the Wall Street Journal.

In a preview, Triller showed off virtual environments the company spent the last two-plus years building, including a sports arena, beach houses surrounded by rippling water and palm trees and a nightclub with projection screens, laser lights and marble floors. Clusters of seating areas provide places for users to talk with one another, either as avatars or via livestreamed video that appears in a dialogue box on the screen.

The Metaverz is accessible via any internet-connected device, through a browser.

The company is working with Epik to create games within its Metaverz. Players can earn digital currency, dubbed Illr Bucks, that can used to buy virtual apparel, customize their avatars, or purchase tickets to events hosted by Triller or its creators.

The Triller video sharing app launched in its current form in October 2019, and has looked to take on larger rival TikTok. The company added fresh content and features to the platform with the acquisitions of live-streaming music platform Verzuz, founded by Grammy-winning producers Swizz Beatz and Timbaland, combat sports brands Bare Knuckle Fighting and Fite.tv, and Fangage, Julius and Amplify.ai, whose technologies help creators connect with and monetize their fan base.

Triller recently raised $310 million from Global Emerging Markets, a Luxembourg-based private investment group, in anticipation of going public as soon as next month.

Triller CEO Mahi de Silva said the company is losing money, but expects to cross into profitability by 2023.

It has run afoul of one of the world's largest music companies, Sony Music Entertainment, which filed a lawsuit against Triller in August in federal district court in New York, seeking millions of dollars in damages after the video-sharing app allegedly stopped paying licensing fees in March 22. De Silva described the lawsuit as a tactic in license negotiations.

The Washington Post also reported this summer that Black influencers, who had been recruited to the platform a year ago with promises of $4,000 per month, say those payments have been erratic -- and in some cases, nonexistent.

""We did have a few hiccups in the beginning of the year,"" de Silva said. ""But we are 100% up to date.""

SEOUL, Oct 21 (Reuters) - South Korea's parliament saw heated debate on Friday over proposed legislation to make global content providers such as Netflix (NFLX.O) and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google pay South Korean network fees.

The deliberations mirror attempts in Europe by some countries that want the European Commission to come up with legislation that ensures Big Tech firms partly finance telecoms infrastructure, as video streaming and other data usage surges.

Various versions of legislation have been proposed in South Korea in the hope of making the companies pay what supporters of the reform call a fair price.

The hearing is expected to be concluded late on Friday but the proposal is still seen as some way away from moving forward to the next stage of the legislative process.

""Google and Netflix account for more than a third of domestic traffic ... It befits global companies to review the issue more proactively,"" lawmaker Hong Suk-joon said during the hearing.

Others disagreed, saying imposing fees on the big tech companies could mean they could raise their own fees and undermine South Korean content creators.

""It risks the collapse of domestic content providers while trying to protect a small number of domestic internet service providers,"" said Jung Chung-rae, head of the parliament committee overseeing the issue.

Google's YouTube has campaigned against the bill and more than 259,824 people have signed a petition opposing the legislation, according to activist group Opennet.

""It will be necessary to deeply review the way the business is run,"" Google South Korea's country director Kyoung Hoon Kim told lawmakers, referring to what would happen if such legislation was introduced.

Liz Chung, a director at Netflix's South Korean unit, said her company was looking for ways to handle surging traffic.

""We are developing a number of technical measures to efficiently utilise networks and respond appropriately to traffic growth,"" Chung said.

In Europe, a regulators' plan to make Google, Meta and Netflix bear some telecoms network costs has been welcomed by big telecoms operators, but smaller ones warned it would distort the telecoms market and harm competition.

It costs money to establish and maintain subsea cables and infrastructure that bring data from one place to another and the exploding popularity of global video content has raised the costs of bringing data stored overseas, experts said.

YouTube has 41.8 million active South Korean users, out of a population of 51.6 million. They used YouTube for a combined 1.38 billion hours in September, according to data provider Mobile Index.

Global mobile data traffic reached 67 exabytes per month by the end of 2021, projected to reach 282 exabytes in 2027, Sweden's Ericsson (ERICb.ST) said in a June report. Video traffic accounts for about 69% of the traffic, and is expected to rise to 79% in 2027.

South Korean network provider SK Broadband has gone to court in the hope of making Big Tech pay fees.

SK declined to comment.

""(Legislation) could have repercussions including content providers passing on costs to end-users,"" said Kim Hyun-kyung, professor at Seoul National University of Science and Technology.

778,META,2022-09-14,Analysis: Google's court setback is good news for landmark EU tech rules,"













LUXEMBOURG, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Google's (GOOGL.O) court defeat on Wednesday is set to strengthen EU antitrust regulators' hand against Big Tech as they roll out landmark rules next year to rein in their powers and force them to play fair with rivals. read more

Critics and rivals of Alphabet unit Google, Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Meta (META.O) fear the deep-pocketed tech giants may challenge the new rules known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in court, tying up regulators and jamming the process.

The DMA sets out a list of dos and don'ts for gatekeepers, companies that control data and access to their platforms, targeting U.S. tech giants' core businesses and practices which regulators say are aimed at reinforcing their dominance.

To make it easy for users to switch to rivals, the companies will have to allow users to remove pre-installed apps, change default settings, install third-party apps and app stores and unsubscribe from core platform services.

Smaller competitors will be allowed to inter-operate with the dominant company's own services and promote their offers and conclude contracts with their customers outside the gatekeeper's platform.

Under the rules, gatekeepers are banned from using the data of business users with whom they compete, unfairly rank their services and products above rivals, or require apps developers to use their payment systems.

""The judgment strengthens the hand of the Commission. It confirms the Commission can use antitrust proceedings as a backstop threat to enforce rapid compliance with digital regulation also known as the DMA,"" said Nicolas Petit, professor at European University Institute.

A two-pronged approach will help regulators, said Thomas Hoppner, a partner at law firm Hausfeld.

""Without effective antitrust enforcement and targeted legislation, Google's core platforms will remain unassailable and a major source of distortions of the competitive process online. This case was just the beginning, but a very important first step,"" he said.

EU lawmaker Andreas Schwab said the judgment underscores the rationale for the DMA.

""Although this judgment comes many years late, I welcome the decision of the General Court that today confirms the need to ban such practices through specific ex ante obligations,"" he said.

""This is the second strike that Google has received almost a year after its sister judgment on the Google Shopping case, and on the same day that the DMA Regulation is officially signed, we can definitely declare 'game over',"" Schwab said.

The Commission should take note of the court's disagreement with its argument on one point, said Ioannis Kokkoris, professor at Queen Mary University of London.

""The reasoning behind annulling part of the decision is based on the evidence submitted and the AEC (as efficient competitor) test while the Court explicitly accepts the conduct being abusive in itself,"" he said.

An AEC test allows regulators to examine a dominant company's costs and sales prices to see whether it is charging below-cost prices.

""This will be a good lesson on the quality of assessment the Commission will need to conduct in enforcing the DMA when it comes to investigating exclusivity conducts in pre-installation cases,"" he said.

779,META,2022-03-25,Analysis: New EU rules regulating U.S. tech giants likely to set global standard,"













BRUSSELS, March 25 (Reuters) - Landmark EU rules targeting Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Meta (FB.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) are likely to set a global benchmark and may even force changes in the tech giants' business models, lawyers and experts said.

Europe's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager on Thursday won backing from European Union members and EU lawmakers for her proposal, the Digital Markets Act (DMA), to rein in the powers of the tech giants via legislation for the first time, rather than lengthy antitrust investigations. read more

The DMA sets out a list of dos and don'ts targeting each tech giant's core business practices.

""DMA is here to stay and will be quickly mirrored in a number of countries. The flexibility that big tech had will be constrained, as the regulatory 'straitjacket' will get tighter globally,"" said Ioannis Kokkoris, competition law professor at Queen Mary University in London.

Vestager's switch to legislation came amid frustration over slow-moving antitrust investigations that deliver remedies criticised by rivals as inadequate, with Google often cited as an example despite being hit with more than 8 billion euros ($8.8 billion) in fines.

The new rules may even spur tech giants to rethink their strategy on long-term goals and swap their business models for others.

""If it succeeds, the DMA will put pressure on monopoly rents of gatekeepers in tipped markets, thereby encouraging them to move towards more long term innovation targets,"" said Nicolas Petit, professor of competition law at the European University Institute in Florence.

""I think the DMA indirectly places a premium on business models based on subscriptions or device level monetisation. We might see more (increased) prices, and vertical integration into hardware in the future,"" he said.

Still, enforcing the DMA will require a bigger team than the small group planned by the European Commission, said Thomas Vinje, a partner at law firm Clifford Chance in Brussels who has advised rivals in cases against Microsoft, Google and Apple.

""The Commission suggested upon proposing the DMA that it would be enforced by a team of 80 people. This will not be enough to enable effective enforcement,"" he said.

""Another big question is who in the Commission will enforce it. Only DG COMP (competition officials) has the technical and industry knowledge and experience dealing with such companies to effectively enforce the DMA. If others in the Commission, such as DG Connect (digital officials), are to enforce the DMA, it will be a dead letter.""

The DMA is just the first step towards making sure that tech giants play fair, said Alec Burnside, a partner at law firm Dechert in Brussels.

""The DMA is not a perfectly formed panacea from the start, and without doubt gatekeepers will try to navigate around it. Rome was not built in a day, nor was the highway code perfect when first conceived,"" he said.

""New rules of the road for the digital economy will be shaped over the period ahead, and the DMA is a crucially important first step.""

There may be some wiggle room for the tech giants to dodge the full impact of the DMA, said Kokkoris.

""The degree of adverse impact on big tech will depend on the extent they can persuade the Commission of the lack of any anti-competitive effect,"" he.

780,META,2022-12-09,The ghost of Instagram haunts Microsoft’s future,"













NEW YORK, Dec 9 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Facebook is Microsoft’s (MSFT.O) antitrust boogeyman. The U.S. regulatory agency, the Federal Trade Commission, is seeking to block the software titan’s $69 billion deal for gaming giant Activision Blizzard , partly to stop domination of the industry as it evolves. The FTC’s leader Lina Khan might be making up for regulators who waved through Mark Zuckerberg’s $1 billion purchase of Instagram. Though Microsoft’s deal is different, punishment under Khan’s regime seemed inevitable.

The FTC is concerned that Microsoft, the owner of the Xbox gaming console, will withhold popular games made by Activision including “Call of Duty” and “World of Warcraft” from competing platforms including Sony’s (6758.T) PlayStation and Nintendo’s (7974.T) Switch. Microsoft has tried to appease this concern. This month, the company led by Satya Nadella agreed to offer games to Nintendo and Sony for 10 years.

The question is what happens after that. Microsoft could try to corner the market by forcing consumers to not only buy the Activision games from Microsoft, but the platform as well. It’s not a stretch either. Outlook, Teams, and other Microsoft operating systems are now all a crucial part of daily life that enterprises buy collectively, not to mention the $1.8 trillion giant’s cloud capabilities.

Still, how the future shakes out for the gaming business is anyone’s guess. Microsoft’s rationale for buying Activision is to better compete in the gaming market against the likes of Tencent (0700.HK) and others. Online gaming has few barriers to entry, and consoles are going the way of Atari. Streaming is the future, and in that way, Microsoft could easily be sidelined in the business if it doesn’t innovate.

Khan has vowed to rethink the way antitrust laws are applied. The agency is seeking to reconsider concentration thresholds to be adjusted to consider “alternative metrics” and “qualitative factors” beyond market share. That requires regulators to imagine harms that may not yet exist.

Zuckerberg and the year 2012 loom large in that sense. That’s when Meta Platform's (META.O) Facebook bought Instagram, then a much smaller rival. The threat of dominance was hard to see. But that transaction, small as it was, turned out to catapult Facebook into one of the world’s largest beneficiaries of digital ad dollars. Khan may be thinking ahead. But it’s the ghost of Facebook that is haunting Microsoft.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Dec. 8 sued to block Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of video-game developer Activision Blizzard, arguing that the combination would hurt consumers because it would give the software company an unfair edge against competitors of its Xbox gaming consoles and cloud-gaming business.

Microsoft President Brad Smith tweeted, “We continue to believe that our deal to acquire Activision Blizzard will expand competition and create more opportunities for gamers and game developers.”

781,META,2022-07-26,"Google’s ""victim of success"" status is worth it","













WASHINGTON, July 26 (Reuters Breakingviews) - For Google, it’s not so bad to be the successful one. The technology giant’s search business is resilient even in the face of economic wobbles that are hurting rivals. That’s partly due to the monopolistic characteristics of its business that make the $1.4 trillion parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) more vulnerable in U.S. antitrust cases against it. But its valuation, and Microsoft’s (MSFT.O) history, show that it will be fine.

Google benefits because of the way it dominates the different facets of the online ad marketplace, running auctions that determine which and how promotions will be shown. On Tuesday, parent Alphabet said that revenue rose 13% in the second quarter, led by a jump in advertising related to its search business. Its cloud business helped too, notching up 36% to $6.3 billion.

A surge in travel, among other activities, has helped and contrasts with Snap (SNAP.N) and Twitter (TWTR.N), which last week missed analyst estimates with disappointing revenue from digital marketing. Still, the success could prompt more attention from the U.S. Justice Department, which sued Google in 2020 for alleged anti-competitive behavior in search and is preparing another lawsuit related to its online marketing business.

The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Alphabet offered to spin off that unit to preempt the government’s legal action. In theory, separating those businesses means that they won’t be sharing information, which could chip away at Google’s dominance.

But companies have weathered this sort of scrutiny before. In 1998, the DOJ accused Microsoft of monopolistic practices by bundling the Internet Explorer browser with its operating system. After several years of litigation, the company agreed to share its program interfaces with third parties as part of a settlement.

Microsoft’s stock meandered between roughly $20 to $30 a share from 2002 to 2013. By 2015, though, it started to get out of its slump, and shares rose fivefold to around $250 a share on Tuesday.

That suggests early innovators that cull market share can have longevity, even if they hit some bumps. Plus Alphabet’s multiple gives it a cushion. Its enterprise value is roughly five times historical sales, a slight discount to where it was in 2017. That’s higher than technology rivals that depend on less dependable brand advertising, like Meta Platforms (META.O), but half the multiple of Microsoft read more . Google may be a victim of its own success, but the success will outlast the victimhood.

782,META,2022-08-05,India M&A veto plans will shake world’s dealmakers,"













MUMBAI, Aug 5 (Reuters Breakingviews) - India is set to take a seat at the global M&A table. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is preparing to give its antitrust enforcer a bigger say in overseas deals. India may have missed the boat to stymie Big Tech unions like Meta Platforms’ 2014 acquisition of WhatsApp, which boasts some 530 million users in the country today, but the new powers will nonetheless shake the world’s dealmakers.

Under a refreshed competition law, expected to be presented to parliament as early as today, all deals exceeding $253 million for firms with “substantial business operations in India” would require permission from the competition commission, according to Bloomberg. In the past, India focused on a merged entity’s asset size and turnover as a criteria to intervene. If lawmakers subsequently come up with a broad definition of what is deemed substantial, authorities will have a freer hand.

Antitrust blocks within the country are rare. In the first decade since India launched its merger control regime in 2011, the regulator approved over 700 filings; while it suggested some remedies for deals, it blocked none, lawyers at Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas say. Indeed, approval for Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries (RELI.NS) to acquire its closest retail rival Future Group, a deal later torpedoed by the latter’s creditors in April, gives an impression that officials have been asleep at the wheel.

Pressure to act is building as M&A activity in the $3 trillion emerging market giant grows. Deals involving an Indian target amounted to $121 billion in the first half of the year, per Refinitiv, almost 6% of the total global value. That puts the country fourth after the United States, China and the UK.

Dealmakers can only hope India is a less complicating factor than its large neighbour. China has a track record of killing deals by withholding antitrust approvals: in 2018, for example, U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm was forced to walk away from its $44 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O) after it failed to secure Beijing’s consent. At the time, the deal’s collapse was seen as collateral damage from China’s trade war with Washington. China may well have had concerns on patents or other business grounds but it left parties guessing, making it harder for companies to agree deals going forward.

India’s rising status as a huge consumer market and growing centre for global innovation give it plenty of reasons to have a big voice in making or breaking deals. Companies around the world will be paying close attention.

783,META,2022-04-25,Breakingviews: Twitter’s board hastily grabs $44 bln bird in hand,"













NEW YORK, April 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - You have to hand it to Elon Musk: He gets things done. Not only did he pull together funding for a $44 billion personal acquisition of Twitter in days, he has persuaded the company to accept his offer in short order. Just 10 days after the social media firm enacted a so-called poison pill to buy time, its directors have accepted the deal offered by the world’s richest man at its original value.

When the Tesla chief executive popped up with a stake of more than 9% in Twitter early in April, Musk agreed to join the board of directors and not raise his ownership beyond 14.9%. Days later he bailed on that accord. Shortly after that, he made an offer for the whole company. Musk lacked financing and had wrongly claimed in 2018 to have secured cash for a Tesla buyout. Moreover, Twitter stock was trading more than 25% above the offer price just last summer. So the board had reasons to proceed cautiously.

The norm would be to demand a higher price from Musk, seek bids from others, or make the case for the company being worth more on its own. Perhaps the board just did a poor job of selling. Co-founder, board member and former chief executive Jack Dorsey has tweeted that the board “has consistently been the dysfunction of this company.” That’s a fair criticism considering the company has failed to take advantage of its high profile. A clear business strategy has been hard to discern.

In the meantime Musk beefed up his offer with a financing package led by Morgan Stanley. And it could be that the board, along with big Twitter shareholders, realized there were no other birds read more in the bush. Musk's likely return on investment is low read more according to a Breakingviews analysis. And at least to date, the company run by Parag Agrawal has not received other offers, according to Reuters’ sources.

Yet the speed of the board's capitulation is curious. Another factor could be that Twitter’s quarterly earnings, scheduled for Thursday this week, will be disappointing. Strong results would justify demanding a higher price or pushing for an independent path. But Facebook owner Meta Platforms lost about a quarter of its market value following the disclosure of unexpectedly weak growth earlier this year and, just last week, Netflix shares tumbled even more. Twitter’s quick sale may simply mean Musk is paying far more than anyone else would.

784,META,2023-02-06,Hedge funds caught in bigger squeeze than 2021 meme stock frenzy - Goldman Sachs note,"













LONDON/NEW YORK, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Hedge funds betting against stocks globally abandoned those trades last week at the fastest pace since 2015, surpassing the speed of their exodus from the meme stock frenzy two years ago, according to a Goldman Sachs research note.

The latest short squeeze, implying that stock prices rose so much that bearish bets become too expensive to hold, saw hedge funds caught out by a sharp rally in equities on Feb. 2 after the U.S. Federal Reserve slowed the pace of interest rate hikes and markets anticipated that rates would peak soon.

According to the Goldman note, seen by Reuters, the speed at which hedge funds exited bearish positions surpassed that seen in January 2021 when retail traders worked in concert to push shortsellers out of stocks such as videogame retailer Gamestop (GME.N) and movie theatre operator AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC.N).

The 2021 buying frenzy of so-called meme stocks started on social media site Reddit, and at-home traders used retail trading platforms such as Robinhood (HOOD.O) to lift the price of heavily shorted stocks such as Gamestop. This forced many shortsellers out of positions and in some cases, funds restructured and returned money to their investors.

After a volatile two years, however, AMC and GME are now trading above their price levels of Jan. 15, 2021 just before the meme stock frenzy began.

Last week's short-squeeze followed a post-Fed rally. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (.IXIC) surged 3.25% on Thursday - its biggest one-day jump in over two months - led by over 20% surges in orthodontic company Align Technology (ALGN.O) and Facebook parent company Meta Platforms (META.O).

That came just a day before a sharp selloff on Friday when stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs data sparked a selloff in world stocks.

Despite the massive short covering, hedge fund managers do not seem to be more upbeat about markets. ""Positioning isn't 'high' and it doesn't seem like many investors are bullish, per se,"" JPMorgan's Positioning Intelligence said in a note reviewed by Reuters, adding it has also seen hedge funds adding some shorts in highly shorted stocks.

World stocks were last down 0.7% (.MIWD00000PUS) with Friday's strong U.S. jobs report renewing concerns that the Fed may have to remain aggressive in its monetary tightening to tame inflation.

Still, the main stock indexes remain up through Friday, led by Nasdaq, which was up by around 14% since the start of this year. Goldman Sachs that fundamental long-short hedge funds posted a gain of 3.79% in January, driven by their market exposure. Systematic long-short funds, which use algorithmic trading, were down 0.50%.

The largest short positions held by hedge funds were in industrials and information technology companies, the Goldman note said. It added that hedge funds also exited many long positions in Asian developing markets and Chinese equities last week.

Resurgent risk appetite among some investors has also fuelled rallies in the shares of so-called meme stocks since the start of this year, though many analysts are sceptical the recent moves will last.

Summary Companies Reliance plans 5G push to take on rivals in India

Partners with Google to make new phone

Intends to launch new consumer goods business

Ambani says children taking leadership roles, being mentored















NEW DELHI, Aug 29 (Reuters) - India's telecom leader Reliance (RELI.NS) said on Monday it is working with Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google to launch a budget 5G smartphone as it laid out a $25 billion plan for introducing the next-generation wireless services within two months.

Speaking at the company's annual general meeting, Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani said Jio's 5G network will be the world's largest, launching in main cities including New Delhi and Mumbai before being expanded across India by December next year.

Ambani, one of India's richest men, said only that the phone being developed with Google would be ""ultra-affordable"". The cheapest 5G phones retail for around $150 currently in India, where around 700 million people don't have a smartphone.

""To take the 5G mass market, a sub-$100 phone is imperative and Jio is rightly positioned to bring 5G to the masses,"" said Neil Shah, vice president of research at Counterpoint.

5G data speeds in India are expected to be about 10 times faster than those of 4G, with the network seen as vital for emerging technologies like self-driving cars and artificial intelligence.

Reliance's 5G plans throw down the gauntlet to rivals Bharti Airtel (BRTI.NS) and Vodafone-Idea (VODA.NS) in the world's second biggest mobile market. Shares in Airtel and Vodafone closed down 1.3% and 3.3% respectively in a weak Mumbai market where Reliance also slipped 0.78%.

Jio, India's biggest mobile carrier with more than 420 million customers, snapped up airwaves worth $11 billion in a $19 billion 5G spectrum auction earlier this month. read more

The aggressive 5G strategy builds on Jio's playbook of disrupting India's telecoms market having sparked a price war in 2016 when it launched cheap 4G data plans and free voice services, and later a 4G smartphone costing just $81, again in partnership with Google.

SUCCESSION, CONSUMER PLAY

With a market value of $220 billion, Ambani's business empire spans telecoms, retail, oil-and-gas and new energy.

He said he was among those mentoring his children on a daily basis as they begin to take the reins at the company, with Akash and Isha assuming leadership roles in Jio digital and in retail respectively, and Anant joining the new energy business.

Akash, 30, was also named chairman of the board of Reliance's telecom unit in June. read more

Ambani senior added that he would provide an update next year on IPO plans for Reliance's digital and retail units, which raised around $22 billion from global investors such as KKR & Co Inc (KKR.N) and Silver Lake in 2020.

Reliance also announced the long-awaited integration of its grocery shopping app JioMart with investor-partner Meta Platform Inc's (META.O) WhatsApp, allowing users to shop via the messaging app.

Separately, Isha Ambani said Reliance will launch a new consumer goods company this year, without giving details.

Reuters exclusively reported in May that Reliance has plans to acquire dozens of grocery and non-food brands to build a $6.5 billion business to challenge foreign giants like Unilever (ULVR.L) read more

786,META,2023-01-04,"Amazon to cut 18,000 jobs as layoffs expand in tech sector","













Jan 5 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) layoffs will now include more than 18,000 roles as part of a workforce reduction it previously disclosed, Chief Executive Andy Jassy said in a public staff note on Wednesday.

The layoff decisions, which Amazon will communicate starting Jan. 18, will largely impact the company's e-commerce and human resources organizations, he said.

The cuts amount to 6% of Amazon's roughly 300,000-person corporate workforce and represent a swift turn for a retailer that recently doubled its base pay ceiling to compete more aggressively for talent.

They also show how layoffs continue to shake the technology sector. Amazon's layoffs now surpass the 11,000 cuts announced last year by Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), underscoring the retailer's slide from an essential business moving goods during pandemic lockdowns, to a company that overbuilt for demand.

Its stock fell more than 1% on Thursday and is half the price it was a year ago.

Amazon has more than 1.5 million workers including warehouse staff, making it America's second-largest private employer after Walmart Inc (WMT.N). Jassy indicated its cuts extend to Europe.

Jassy said in the note that annual planning ""has been more difficult given the uncertain economy and that we've hired rapidly over the last several years"".

The reductions will bring Amazon's corporate workforce closer to September 2021 levels, when it told Reuters this headcount numbered around 275,000 people globally.

For months the company has braced for likely slower growth as soaring inflation encouraged businesses and consumers to cut back spending. U.S. retailers overall saw a smaller rise in online sales this holiday season, with a recent measure of consumer prices up about 7% from a year earlier.

Amazon began letting staff go in November from its devices division, with a source telling Reuters at the time it was targeting around 10,000 cuts.

The tech industry shed more than 150,000 workers in 2022, according to tracking site Layoffs.fyi, a number that is continuing to grow. On Wednesday, Salesforce Inc (CRM.N) also said it planned to eliminate about 10% of staff, which numbered nearly 8,000 as of Oct. 31.

Jassy's note followed a report in the Wall Street Journal that the reduction would be more than 17,000 jobs. He said Amazon chose to disclose the news before informing affected staff because of a leak.

Amazon still must file certain legal notices about mass layoffs, and it plans to pay severance.

Jassy said: ""Amazon has weathered uncertain and difficult economies in the past, and we will continue to do so.""

A spokesperson for London-based trade union GMB said it was aware of the reduction, but its members would not be affected.

Those belonging to the union who work at the Amazon warehouse in Coventry, central England, are planning to stage a walkout on Jan. 25 over a pay row with the e-commerce giant.

Douglas Harper, a spokesperson for Spain's largest trade union CCOO, criticized what he said was a total lack of information from the company.

""We don't know how this will affect us in Spain,"" Harper told Reuters. Most Amazon employees do not have union representation.

787,META,2022-06-03,Amazon executive behind its massive delivery operation to leave after 23 years,"[1/3] Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations, speaks during a press conference announcing Amazon.com's new program to help entrepreneurs build businesses delivering Amazon packages, including $1 million to fund startup costs for military veterans, in Seattle, Washington, U.S., June 27, 2018. REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson















June 3 (Reuters) - Dave Clark, the executive who made Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) into a worldwide delivery behemoth, is stepping down as chief executive of the online retailer's consumer business to pursue other opportunities, the company said on Friday.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said he expects to name a replacement in the next few weeks and that the company has work ahead ""to get to where we ultimately want to be"" in the division Clark ran. Clark's last day will be July 1, after 23 years with the company.

The departure further solidifies a changing of the guard at Amazon, which for years had veteran ranks under founder Jeff Bezos. A string of management departures including vice presidents and Bezos himself have shaken up the e-commerce and cloud company, though executives have aimed to maintain the customer focus and startup mentality of their founder.

The online retailer is also girding for economic challenges, recently reporting a $2 billion hit from having built too much warehousing and transportation capacity, vowing now to reduce the costs of fulfilling orders. read more

In a statement on Twitter, Clark said he wanted to get back to building. ""It's what drives me,"" he said, adding he leaves Amazon with ""a solid multi-year plan to fight the inflationary challenges we are facing in 2022.""

loading

Clark no longer wanted Jassy, his new manager, to second-guess him, a person familiar with the matter said. Amazon declined to comment.

Clark joined Amazon in May 1999, a day after graduating from business school. He quickly rose ranks, from an operations manager in Kentucky to running all of Amazon's retail, logistics and other consumer-facing businesses as of last year. In the process he built an in-house delivery operation that rivaled industry stalwarts FedEx Corp (FDX.N) and United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N).

""He took risks that others wouldn't consider,"" said Michael Indresano, an Amazon logistics vice president until 2017. Clark, his former boss, had the idea of acquiring dozens of planes to give Amazon more control over shipping, and he championed the use of robots in warehouses, Indresano said.

Clark's departure is the second high-profile exit this week after Meta Platforms Inc's (FB.O) operations chief, Sheryl Sandberg, announced that she was leaving the company after 14 years. read more

Tumult in Amazon's warehouse and delivery operation that Clark steered has been relentless since COVID-19 began spreading more than two years ago. As home-shopping orders jumped, workers fell ill and the company had to usher in more than 150 changes, from adding temperature scanners to technology for monitoring social distancing.

The change coincided with an increase in union organizing and scrutiny of Amazon's safety conditions, pay and productivity tracking. Clark defended Amazon vociferously, occasionally trading barbs with critics. ""I often say we are the Bernie Sanders of employers, but that's not quite right because we actually deliver a progressive workplace,"" he tweeted last year. read more

More recently Clark has contended with a shortage of workers willing to fill warehouse jobs and higher gas prices. That led to the company's first-ever fuel and inflation surcharge on merchants who pay Amazon to fulfill their products in the United States, among other measures to address costs.

788,META,2022-03-22,"EU’s faster, harder stick will whack U.S. big tech","













NEW YORK, March 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Regulators around the world have been trying to crack into the dominance that big technology firms like Apple (AAPL.O) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) have created. So far, they have been too slow and toothless to prevent them from growing. Europe’s Digital Markets Act, which might be agreed upon this month read more according to European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager, gets closer to changing that.

Scale creates momentum at technology firms through aspects like networks effects. The more people use a site, like Meta Platforms’ (FB.O) Facebook, for example, the more others want to engage. Often that scale helps profit, too, as upfront costs to penetrate a market with new tech can be high. The payoff comes when a company gains market share and momentum, so tech firms are motivated to push for a monopoly as fast as possible.

Regulators are often behind. They work at a slower pace by nature, but also heading off a monopoly at a tech company before it is established is nearly impossible. And because innovative tech, by definition, is new, regulators are often forced to redefine markets before they can crack down.

So far attempts to dent tech firms’ dominance haven’t worked. Take Alphabet’s fight with the European Commission, which started in 2010. It resulted in nearly $10 billion in fines, but the firm’s operating profit grew seven-fold since that period, to over $300 billion. Moreover, Alphabet has yet to actually pay those fines, and Google retains about 90% of the European search market.

The proposed rules in Europe impose a set of “do and don’t” obligations, like saying companies cannot prefer their own products or services and must allow interoperability with third-party software. The exact limitations and penalties are still under discussion, but firms that break such rules might be fined up to 20% of annual revenue and repeat offenders may be broken up. These are solid threats more damaging than other penalties read more that have been enacted.

Compliance will be costly. If apps become available outside Apple’s store, its margins could fall. Amazon.com’s (AMZN.O) own-label products might see slower expansion, and Alphabet’s users may click away from Google more often.

Yet Europe is a huge market, making up roughly a quarter of revenue at Apple. So companies don’t have the option to walk away. Vestager may ultimately not be able to enforce as stringently as she would like, but she’s getting much closer to cracking big tech’s dominance.

CONTEXT NEWS

- New European Union legislation that reins in the powers of Alphabet’s Google, Amazon.com, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft could be completed by the end of March, European antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on March 16.

- The Digital Markets Act imposes “do and don’t” obligations on so-called “gatekeeper firms” such as saying the companies cannot prefer their own products or services and must allow interoperability with third-party software.

- Issues still under discussion include the thresholds at which firms become gatekeepers, what interoperability entails, and penalties.

- Companies that don’t comply could be fined. The European Parliament has proposed fines ranging from 4% to 20% of worldwide revenue under the Act. Gatekeepers that systematically violate their obligations may be required to divest businesses.

NEW YORK, June 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. stock market's brutal year reached a grim milestone as the S&P 500's slide on Monday confirmed a bear market for the first time since March 2020, fueled by worries over sky-high inflation, a hawkish Federal Reserve and future economic growth.

With a 3.9% drop on Monday, the benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX) index ended 21.8% below its Jan. 3 record closing high. By falling at least 20% from its peak, the index confirmed a bear market, under a common definition used by market watchers.

If history is any guide, a bear market would mean more pain could be in store for investors. The S&P 500 has fallen by an average of 32.7% in 13 bear markets since 1946, including a nearly 57% drop during the 2007-2009 bear market during the financial crisis, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.

It has taken a little over a year on average for the index to reach its bottom during bear markets, and then roughly another two years to return to its prior high, according to CFRA. Of the 13 bear markets since 1946, the return to breakeven levels has varied, taking as little as three months to as long as 69 months.

Reuters Graphics

The S&P 500 surged some 114% from its March 2020 low as stocks benefited from emergency policies put in place to help stabilize the economy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Those gains went into reverse at the start of 2022 as the Fed grew far more hawkish and signaled it would tighten monetary policy at a faster-than-expected clip to fight surging inflation. It has already raised rates by 75 basis points this year and expectations of more hikes ahead, including at this week's Fed meeting, have weighed on stocks and bonds.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has vowed to raise rates as high as needed to kill inflation but also believes policymakers can guide the economy to a so-called soft landing. Adding to the volatility this year has been the war in Ukraine, which has caused a further spike in oil and other commodity prices.

After the S&P 500 nearly confirmed a bear market last month, the market rallied back, amid some hopes the Fed could slow its rate-hike pace later this year.

But Wall Street last week posted its biggest weekly decline since January, with the latest blow to stocks coming on Friday, when data showed U.S. consumer prices accelerated in May as gasoline prices hit a record high and the cost of food soared, leading to the largest annual increase in nearly 40-1/2 years. read more

for 2022

A few areas of the stock market have been spared. Energy shares have soared this year, along with oil prices, while defensive groups such as utilities have held up better than broader markets.

On the flip side, shares of technology and other high-growth companies have been hit hard. Those stocks - high fliers during much of the bull market over the past decade - are particularly sensitive to higher yields, which dull the allure of companies whose cash flows are weighted more in the future and diminished when discounted at higher rates.

Some of the biggest of these companies, such as Tesla (TSLA.O) and Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O), are also heavily weighted in the S&P 500 index.

Investors have looked at various metrics to determine when markets will turn higher, including the Cboe Volatility Index (.VIX), also known as Wall Street’s fear gauge. While the index is elevated compared with its long-term median, it is still below peaks reached in previous major sell-offs.

791,META,2023-02-02,Morning bid: Markets go all in for disinflation,"













SYDNEY, Feb 2 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Wayne Cole.

Push back? What push back? The main theme ahead of the Fed announcement was that Chair Jerome Powell would definitely, totally, absolutely push back against the recent rapid easing in market conditions given inflation was still sky high.

Instead, Powell seemed to go out of his way to do the opposite. The very first question in the new conference invited him to scold markets, and he notes conditions had tightened a lot last year.

Given another opportunity, he says he's ""not particularly concerned"" about market pricing, and later ""I'm not going to try to persuade people that have a different forecast"" on inflation and policy.

Yes there were caveats about it being too early to declare victory and policy will need to be more restrictive. But even then he was blase about another ""couple of hikes"", and spent more time trying out his new favourite word ""disinflation"".

A pdf search of the conference shows disinflation or disinflationary was used 13 times, compared to twice at his December event. For sure, service inflation had yet to turn the corner, but he expected to see that ""fairly soon.""

For markets, this is like stealing the last cookie in the cookie jar, getting caught red handed, and, instead of a good spanking, you get another cookie, with chocolate on.

So of course Treasuries rallied, with 10s down 9bp and 2s 10bp in the wake of the conference and a bit more in Asia. Next targets are the Jan lows at 3.321% and 4.04%.

Fed funds partied by pricing in more rate cuts with Fed funds seen at 4.40% by end 2023 and 3.0% by the close of 2024.

The euro jumped to a 10-month peak of $1.1034 and could go further if ECB chief Christine Lagarde sounds as hawkish as everyone seems to expect after today's policy meeting.

The market is almost fully priced for a hike of 50bp and the promise of more to come, though it was notable that Euribor rallied overnight to imply deeper cuts next year. read more

The ECB is also set to reveal how exactly it plans to reduce the multi-trillion euro stock of bonds on its balance sheet.

Across the Channel, the Bank of England is also seen hiking 50bp today, though with some outside risk of 25bp. read more

The following media conference by Governor Andrew Bailey and colleagues is likely to be a tough one, assuming they can even get to it given all the strikes.

The IMF, and many others, are predicting recession but inflation is at 10.5% and wage growth running red hot - good luck squaring that circle.

For Wall Street, it's a massive earnings day and Meta helped overnight by announcing a $40 billion buy-back that sent its shares up 18%.

Healthcare companies BristolMeyers-Squibb Co (BMY.N), Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) and Merck & Co (MRK.N) are due to report before trading commences on Wall Street.

The heavy-hitting trifecta of Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) are after the bell.

Key developments that could influence markets on Thursday:

- BoE rate decision is at 1200 GMT and the ECB at 1315 GMT. BoE Gov Bailey speaks to reporters at 1230 GMT and ECB President Lagarde at 1345 GMT.

NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - An unexpected result in Tuesday’s U.S. midterm election could roil markets positioned for relative calm, options strategists said.

Control of the U.S. Congress is at stake in Tuesday's midterms, with Republicans favored by polls and betting markets to win control of the House of Representatives and possibly the Senate. With Democrat Joe Biden in the White House, that potential result would lead to a split government, an outcome seen as broadly favorable to markets over the long term.

But a surprise victory by the Democrats could throw the markets for a loop, potentially bringing to the fore concerns about tech-sector regulation as well as budget spending that could buoy already-high inflation, according to market participants.

Analysts said a calendar full of closely watched macroeconomic events such as last week’s Federal Reserve meeting and U.S. consumer price data later this week have left traders less focused on the vote than might normally be the case.

With investors' election-related hedging comparatively light, ""any surprise would probably be exacerbated by thin markets and the relatively high volatility landscape that we are looking at right now,"" said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group.

Options positioning implied a 1.5% decline in the S&P 500 on the day after the vote should Democrats pull off a stronger-than-expected showing, according to Tom Borgen-Davis, head of equity research at options market making firm Optiver.

A ""big Democratic win could be taken negatively for the tech sector just given they are more likely to bring in regulations in the sector, relative to Republicans,"" Borgen-Davis said.

That said, options traders do not seem to be positioned for fireworks. For example, open puts on the Nasdaq 100-tracking PowerShares QQQ Trust's (QQQ.O) options, typically used for defensive positioning, outnumber calls, usually employed for bullish wagers, 1.4-to-1, one of the smallest margins since mid-June, according to Trade Alert data.

Meanwhile, the Cboe Volatility index (.VIX), known as Wall Street's fear gauge, fell on Monday to close at a near two-month low. The SPX rose 0.96% but is still down 20% for the year.

Falling expectations for volatility could set markets up for a midterm surprise

Strategists at Morgan Stanley including Mike Wilson wrote on Monday that a Democratic win could send Treasury yields higher and strengthen the dollar, reflecting the view that higher fiscal spending could exacerbate inflation and force the Fed to raise rates higher than expected.

""Markets could assign a higher probability to further fiscal expansion, with Congress and the Fed effectively pulling in opposite directions on inflation,"" Morgan Stanley's analysts wrote.

On the other hand, a clean sweep by the Republicans could increase the chances of a Republican spending freeze, boosting Treasuries and supporting the most recent rebound in U.S. stocks, which has sputtered this month, according to Morgan Stanley.

At the individual stock level, certain names have the potential for higher election-related volatility, strategists at Goldman Sachs said in a note earlier this month.

For instance, revenue at iHeartMedia Inc (IHRT.O) Fox Corp (FOXA.O), Paramount Global (PARA.O) and Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) could potentially get a short-term boost from ad-related spending around midterm elections, according to the report.

Meanwhile, shares of tobacco company Philip Morris International Inc (PM.N) could be volatile around regulatory restrictions, Goldman’s analysts wrote.

Summary Companies European Central Bank raises key policy rate

First Republic Bank shares reverse course and turn higher

Meta, Snap climb as U.S. threatens TikTok ban















NEW YORK, March 16 (Reuters) - A strong rebound by financials helped Wall Street's main indexes close firmly positive on Thursday, after some of the country's largest lenders came to the rescue of embattled First Republic Bank.

The technology sector (.SPLRCT) also contributed to the gains, helping to boost the Nasdaq Composite to its strongest performance since Feb. 2, 2022.

The latest twist in the U.S. regional banks saga came on the heels of a 50 basis point rate hike by the European Central Bank, which earlier in the day had dampened investor sentiment already hurt by fears of a banking crisis.

Financial institutions, including JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), confirmed earlier reports they would deposit up to $30 billion into First Republic Bank's coffers to stabilize the lender.

""Banks are looking out for one another,"" said Huntington Private Bank chief investment officer, John Augustine.

""We had two outliers go down and now they want to save what is considered a more mainstream bank.""

Shares of JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley were up 1.94% and 1.89% respectively, while the lifeline buoyed First Republic Bank (FRC.N), which gained 9.98%.

The positive sentiment spread to other regional lenders, with Alliance Bancorp (WAL.N) and PacWest Bancorp (PACW.O) advancing 14.09% and 0.7%, respectively, following a negative start.

The KBW regional banking index (.KRX) gained 3.26%, while the S&P 500 banking index (.SPXBK) advanced 2.16%, as both sub-indexes reversed losses.

Concerns about banks have rattled the stock market in recent days after the collapse of SVB Financial fueled contagion fears.

Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the U.S. banking system remains sound and Americans can feel confident that their deposits will be there when needed.

U.S.-listed shares of Credit Suisse advanced after the bank secured a credit line of up to $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank to shore up liquidity and investor confidence.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 371.98 points, or 1.17%, to 32,246.55, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 68.35 points, or 1.76%, to 3,960.28 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 283.23 points, or 2.48%, to 11,717.28.

Data showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, pointing to continued labor market strength, which could persuade the Fed to keep raising rates further.

Weak retail sales figures, as well as data showing a downward trend in producer inflation, on Wednesday had bolstered bets of a small rate hike by the Federal Reserve at its meet concluding on March 22.

Money markets are still largely pricing in a 25-basis-point rate hike by the Fed at its March 22 policy announcement. .

Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META.O) and Snapchat operator Snap Inc (SNAP.N) climbed 3.63% and 7.25%, after the U.S. administration threatened to impose a ban on rival TikTok.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.80-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.95-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 4 new 52-week highs and 22 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 38 new highs and 235 new lows.

Jan 20 (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. grocers, packaged food companies and supermarkets were lagging in the first three weeks of 2023, in a sharp contrast to last year, as their high valuations and fading dividend appeal pushed investors to U.S. Treasuries.

The S&P 500 consumer staple sector (.SPLRCS), along with other bond proxies including real estate (.SPLRCR) and utilities (.SPLRCU), outperformed the broader market in 2022 amid recession fears, as investors sought shelter in dividend-paying companies.

In a reversal of the trend, consumer staples sector has shed 3.4% in 2023, the most among the major S&P sectors, while the S&P 500 (.SPX) has climbed 1.5% on easing bets of a severe economic downturn.

""Fundamentally, investors are starting to recognize the valuation of staples as a whole, which trade at a 25% premium to historical averages,"" said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors LLC.

""You couple this with the fact that there are other yield alternatives now relative to the yield-rich sector of staples.""

Rising interest rates have lured investors towards robust payouts in U.S. government bonds for the first time in nearly a decade.

The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield stands at 3.4%, while the consumer staples sector is offering a dividend yield of 2.7%, according to Refinitiv data.

Bond Proxies versus Treasury Yields

Consumer companies, which witnessed soaring demand for groceries and cleaning supplies during the peak of the pandemic, are now battling a triple whammy of low sales volumes, high input costs and a stronger dollar, as evidenced by results from Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) on Thursday.

The bellwether for consumer products companies warned of profit pressures due to high commodity prices, as well as inflation-weary shoppers cutting back.

Quarterly reports from Unilever , Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), PepsiCo Inc (PEP.O), Colgate Palmolive Co (CL.N), Kellogg Co (K.N) and Hershey Co (HSY.N) in the coming weeks will shed more light on the health of the sector and set the tone for its performance during the year.

Investors have also piled into rate-sensitive tech and growth stocks, which were clobbered in 2022.

Communication services index (.SPLRCL) that houses Meta Platforms (META.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), and consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) that includes Amazon.com (AMZN.O) are leading gains in 2023 in the run-up to the companies' earnings.

""You get more defensive in periods of economic stress... but earnings will triumph for the next couple of weeks,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.

""It's always where the rubber meets the road.""

795,META,2022-09-28,EXCLUSIVE Vietnam preparing rules to limit news posts on social media accounts - sources,"













SINGAPORE/HANOI, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Vietnam is preparing new rules to limit which social media accounts can post news-related content, three people familiar with the matter said, as authorities tighten their control over news and information sources in the country.

The rules, expected to be announced by the year-end and with details yet to be hammered out, would establish a legal basis for controlling news dissemination on platforms like Facebook and YouTube while placing a significant moderation burden on platform providers, two of the sources added.

The sources asked not to be identified, as discussions about the new rules remain confidential.

Vietnam's Ministry of Information and Communications and Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

""The government wants to fix what it sees as the 'news-lisation' of social media,"" said one source familiar with the talks. ""News-lisation"", or báo hoá, is a term used by the authorities to describe the misleading of users into thinking that social media accounts are authorised news outlets.

Government officials have been holding confidential meetings with popular social media and internet firms to brief them on which types of accounts will be allowed to post news content under the new rules, according to the sources.

Authorities would be able to order social media companies to ban accounts that break those rules, they said.

Vietnam's ruling Communist Party already maintains tight media censorship and tolerates little dissent, with one of the world's most stringent internet regimes and national guidelines on social media behaviour.

Two sources with direct knowledge told Reuters that more rules on internet and social media platforms would be introduced around the fourth quarter of 2022 to early 2023.

As tech-savvy young Vietnamese increasingly turn to social media for information, those platforms have become a target for government efforts to restrict the flow of news from unauthorised sources.

Vietnam is a top-10 market globally for Facebook with 60 million to 70 million users, according to 2021 data, and sources familiar with the matter said it generates around $1 billion in annual revenue for the company – surpassing France.

YouTube has 60 million users in Vietnam and TikTok has 20 million, according to 2021 government estimates, although Twitter remains a relatively small player.

Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), owner of Facebook, and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) declined to comment. Alphabet Inc's Google and YouTube did not respond to requests for comment. TikTok said in a statement that it addresses content violations based on applicable laws and with adherence to its guidelines, but did not comment on pending Vietnam regulations.

The Vietnamese government had adopted in July a set of non-binding guidelines on what qualifies as news outlets, including criteria to distinguish ""real"" and ""fake"" news outlets, warning that some social networking sites include accounts that mislead users into thinking they are newspapers.

Those guidelines are expected to be incorporated into the new rules, which will be binding.

The authorities are also expected to implement new rules that would require social media platforms to immediately take down content deemed to harm national security, and to remove illegal content within 24 hours, sources familiar with the matter said.

Sources told Reuters in April that the new rules, which were originally planned for July, reflected the government's dissatisfaction with social media platforms' take-down rates. read more

This will be done through amendments to the country's main internet law.

Vietnam in August also issued a new regulation, due to come into effect from October, that will require technology firms to store users' data locally and to set up local offices.

796,META,2022-10-25,Alphabet's miss fans inflation fears across digital advertising,"













Oct 25 (Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) disappointing ad sales sparked worries across the digital media sector on Tuesday as advertisers cut back on their spending in the face of an economic slowdown.

Alphabet called out slowing spending by advertisers on YouTube, said financial services spending was cooling on Google, and plans to cut hiring by more than half.

The negative results shattered many expectations that Google, which is the world's largest digital advertising platform by market share, would remain strong in a weakening economy and reinforced worries on Wall Street that inflation will continue to hurt advertising spending. Last week, smaller rival Snap Inc's (SNAP.N) slowest-ever revenue growth rate sent inflation fears through tech sector and temporarily wiped out $40 billion in market capitalization.

Shares in Alphabet fell 6.5% in trading after the bell.

Alphabet's weak results raises concerns for other companies in the sector, especially advertising-dependent Meta Platforms (META.O). The Facebook parent, which reports results on Wednesday, saw shares drop 4.5% on Tuesday.

Ruth Porat, Alphabet's chief financial officer, said the deceleration in overall advertising revenue was due to last quarter's ""very strong performance,"" adding that lower ad sales on YouTube were due to some advertisers pulling back on their ad spending.

Companies that slowed ad spending included those in financial services such as insurance, mortgages and cryptocurrencies, Alphabet said. Travel and retail advertisers helped Google Search ad revenue.

Google's advertising revenue was $54.48 billion in the third quarter, compared with $53.13 billion last year but came in below analysts' expectations.

The company said total revenue was $69.09 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with $65.12 billion a year earlier.

Analysts on average expected revenue to be $70.58 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

""Google’s earnings miss this quarter proves it’s not immune to the challenges facing the digital advertising industry at large,"" said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.

The speed of the slowdown also shocked investors who are ""highly sensitive to the changing tide,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

Ad sales on streaming video site YouTube also declined to $7.07 billion, from $7.2 billion in the prior-year quarter.

Alphabet's net income fell to $13.91 billion, or $1.06 per share, from $18.94 billion, or $1.40 per share, a year earlier. Net income missed analyst expectations of $1.25 per share.

The company's operating margin declined to 25% in the third quarter, from 32% in the prior year.

The tech giant said in July it would slow the pace of hiring for the rest of the year, saying it was ""not immune to economic headwinds."" Porat said the company hired 12,700 people in the third quarter and expects to hire less than half that number in the final quarter.

Revenue from Google Cloud rose to $6.9 billion during the quarter, from $5 billion a year earlier.

During a conference call with analysts, Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said the company would continue to evaluate its projects and make ""course corrections"" as needed. ""Times like this are clarifying,"" he said.

797,META,2022-07-05,"Samsung Q2 solid on server-chip demand, smartphones cloud outlook","Summary

Summary Companies Profit likely up 15% to 14.46 trln won -Refinitiv SmartEstimate

That would be highest April-June profit since 2018

Q2 chip earnings likely soared 49% -analysts' est

Mobile business profit likely down about 17% -analysts' est















SEOUL, July 5 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) is likely to turn in its best April-June profit since 2018 with a 15% year-on-year rise, as lingering demand for its memory chips from server customers offsets lower sales to inflation-hit smartphone makers.

Operating profit for the world's biggest smartphone and memory-chip maker likely jumped to 14.46 trillion won ($11.2 billion) in the quarter, according to a Refinitiv SmartEstimate from 24 analysts, from 12.57 trillion won a year earlier.

Its chip earnings likely soared 49% to 10.3 trillion won, an average of seven estimates shows. The chip business accounts for about half of the South Korean tech giant's profits.

On the overall outlook for global memory chip demand, Park Sung-soon, analyst at CAPE Investment & Securities, said U.S. data centre firms such as Amazon (AMZN.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O) and Meta (META.O) are expected to continue buying ""to meet expanding demand for cloud services"".

Chip inventories at these companies are not high compared to 2018 levels, Park added.

Making a case for strong server demand, Taiwanese contract electronics supplier and Apple iPhone maker Foxconn (2317.TW) on Monday raised its full-year outlook and said it was optimistic about the third quarter. read more

Still, chipmakers worldwide are facing cooling demand after two bumper pandemic years when people bought phones and laptops to work remotely, which resulted in a chip shortage and forced companies including automakers to pay top dollar for key chips, pushing their prices up. read more

Also, China's recent COVID-19 lockdowns choked consumer demand and boosted inflation in the world's No.2 economy, resulting in steep falls in smartphone sales. read more

Concerns about a downturn in major markets, including the United States, due to high inflation and the war in Ukraine are also prompting consumers and corporates to tighten budgets.

'WEAKENED CONSIDERABLY'

Rival memory-chipmaker Micron Technology (MU.O) last week forecast much worse-than-expected quarterly revenue and said the market had ""weakened considerably in a very short period of time"", though it was confident about long-term demand. read more

Data provider TrendForce said prices of specific DRAM chips, used in tech devices and servers, fell about 12% last month from a year earlier, signalling smaller margins for chipmakers in coming quarters.

Samsung's mobile business profit is expected to have slipped some 17% to 2.7 trillion won from a year earlier, analysts said.

They expect the company's smartphone shipments to have dropped to between 61 million and 68 million units in the second quarter, from 74 million in the first.

Industrywide shipments of smartphones to China - the world's biggest smartphone market - are expected to shrink by 18% this year, according to Gartner.

Shares in Samsung, which will announce preliminary results on Thursday, have fallen about 27% this year, versus a 38% slump in the Philadelphia Semiconductor index (.SOX).

798,META,2022-10-05,Explainer: What is an 'everything app' and why does Elon Musk want to make one?,"













Oct 28 (Reuters) - Why is Elon Musk suddenly thinking about creating an ""everything app,"" and what does that even mean?

The question arose after the billionaire chief executive of Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) earlier this month reversed course on his decision not to buy Twitter Inc (TWTR.N).

Musk completed his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter on Thursday, but provided little clarity on how he will achieve the ambitions he has outlined for the influential social media platform.

The concept of an everything app, often referred to as a ""super app,"" is massively popular in Asia and tech companies across the world have tried to replicate it.

WHAT IS A SUPER APP?

A super app, or what Musk refers to as an ""everything app,"" has been described as the Swiss army knife of mobile apps, offering a suite of services for users such as messaging, social networking, peer-to-peer payments and e-commerce shopping.

These mega apps are widely used in Asia because mobile is the main form of access to the internet for many people in the region, wrote Scott Galloway, a New York University professor of marketing and co-host of tech podcast ""Pivot,"" last year.

WHAT ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF SUPER APPS?

Chinese super app WeChat has more than 1 billion monthly users, according to one estimate, and is a ubiquitous part of daily life in China. Users can hail a car or taxi, send money to friends and family or make payments at stores. In 2018, some Chinese cities began testing WeChat for an electronic identification system that would be tied to users' accounts, according to the South China Morning Post.

Grab, a leading super app across Southeast Asia, offers food delivery, ride-hailing, on-demand package delivery and financial services and investing.

WHY DOES MUSK WANT TO MAKE A SUPER APP?

During a question-and-answer session with Twitter employees in June, Musk noted there is no equivalent to a super app like WeChat outside of Asia.

""You basically live on WeChat in China,"" he said, adding he saw an opportunity to create such an app.

Adding more tools and services to Twitter could also help Musk reach his lofty growth goals for the company. During the Q&A with employees, Musk said he wanted Twitter to grow from its 237 million users to ""at least a billion"".

Musk and members of his inner circle texted multiple times about the idea of adding digital payments to Twitter, according to messages released in the discovery phase of litigation between Musk and the social media company. read more

In the text messages Musk discussed the possibility of placing Twitter on the blockchain, though he later appeared to decide such a move would not work.

However, crypto exchange Binance, which has invested $500 million into Musk's buyout of the social media firm, is creating a team to work on how blockchain and crypto could be helpful to Twitter, a company spokesperson said on Friday.

HAVE OTHER U.S. TECH COMPANIES TRIED THIS?

Yes, Snapchat parent Snap Inc (SNAP.N) previously introduced peer-to-peer payments called Snapcash, but ended the feature in 2018. It also made a push into mobile gaming and recently ended that venture as part of cost-cutting plans.

Meta Platform Inc's Facebook and Instagram have also tried to expand beyond social networking and messaging into e-commerce.

799,META,2022-08-11,"Twitter plan to fight midterm misinformation falls short, voting rights experts say","













Aug 11 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) on Thursday set out a plan to combat the spread of election misinformation that revives previous strategies, but civil and voting rights experts said it would fall short of what is needed to prepare for the upcoming U.S. midterm elections.

The social media company said it will apply its civic integrity policy, introduced in 2018, to the Nov. 8 midterms, when numerous U.S. Senate and House of Representatives seats will be up for election. The policy relies on labeling or removing posts with misleading content, focused on messages intended to stop voting or claims intended to undermine public confidence in an election.

In a statement, Twitter said it has taken numerous steps in recent months to ""elevate reliable resources"" about primaries and voting processes. Applying a label to a tweet also means the content is not recommended or distributed to more users.

The San Francisco-based company is currently in a legal battle with billionaire Elon Musk over his attempt to walk away from his $44-billion deal to acquire Twitter.

Musk has called himself a ""free speech absolutist,"" and has said Twitter posts should only be removed if there is illegal content, a view supported by many in the tech industry. read more

But civil rights and online misinformation experts have long accused social media and tech platforms of not doing enough to prevent the spread of false content, including the idea that President Joe Biden did not win the 2020 election.

They warn that misinformation could be an even greater challenge this year, as candidates who question the 2020 election are running for office, and divisive rhetoric is spreading following an FBI search of former President Donald Trump's Florida home earlier this week. read more

""We're seeing the same patterns playing out,"" said Evan Feeney, deputy senior campaign director at Color of Change, which advocates for the rights of Black Americans.

In the blog post, Twitter said a test of redesigned labels saw a decline in users' retweeting, liking and replying to misleading content.

Researchers say Twitter and other platforms have a spotty record in consistently labeling such content.

In a paper published last month, Stanford University researchers examined a sample of posts on Twitter and Meta Platforms' (META.O) Facebook that altogether contained 78 misleading claims about the 2020 election. They found that Twitter and Facebook both consistently applied labels to only about 70% of the claims.

In a statement, Twitter said it has taken numerous steps in recent months to ""elevate reliable resources"" about primaries and voting processes.

Twitter's efforts to fight misinformation during the midterms will include information prompts to debunk falsehoods before they spread widely online.

More emphasis should be placed on removing false and misleading posts, said Yosef Getachew, media and democracy program director at nonpartisan group Common Cause.

""Pointing them to other sources isn’t enough,"" he said.

Experts also questioned Twitter's practice of leaving up some tweets from world leaders in the name of public interest.

""Twitter has a responsibility and ability to stop misinformation at the source,"" Feeney said, saying that world leaders and politicians should face a higher standard for what they tweet.

Twitter leads the industry in releasing data on how its efforts to intervene against misinformation are working, said Evelyn Douek, an assistant professor at Stanford Law School who studies online speech regulation.

Yet more than a year after soliciting public input on what the company should do when a world leader violates its rules, Twitter has not provided an update, she said.

800,META,2022-08-03,It’s not so bad being a bubble stock after all,"













NEW YORK, Aug 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - At $310 billion AMTD Digital is worth roughly 10 Twitters (TWTR.N), almost four Targets (TGT.N), one-and-a-half Walt Disneys (DIS.N), or three-quarters of a Meta Platforms . The Hong Kong-based digital-platform company, created by local financial-services firm AMTD Idea (AMTD.N), is the latest firm whose shares have been fueled by irrationally exuberant investors – be it the meme-stock craze that swept up businesses from GameStop (GME.N) to AMC Entertainment (AMC.N), or other bubble-like market mentalities that gave massive boosts to Robinhood Markets , Microstrategy (MSTR.O) and the like. Sure, the air has come out of most of the hype – but it was still worth it.

AMTD’s executives will be hoping for a similar outcome. After more than doubling again on Tuesday, its shares now trade more than 215 times higher than when they listed on the New York Stock Exchange less than three weeks ago. Parent AMTD Idea has been riding its subsidiary’s coattails for the past few days, jumping roughly five-fold since late last week. There’s no logical business reason for such a performance. AMTD Digitaladmitted as much in a thank-you statement, saying that there were “no material circumstances, events nor other matters” since its initial public offering.

In the end, it might not matter. While AMC’s stock price is down more than 70% from its high, at almost $17 a share it is still more than double its pre-pandemic value. Shares of Microstrategy, the analytics company which bought almost 130,000 bitcoin at an average price of nearly $31,000, now worth a quarter less, have benefitted a similar amount start-to-finish. GameStop, effectively a penny stock pre-pandemic, trades at around $35 a share.

Robinhood Markets might appear to be a loser: The trading platform that partly enabled these stock crazes said on Tuesday it was laying off more than a fifth of its workforce, and its shares are worth a fraction of their listing price a year ago. Still, the company run by Vlad Tenev timed the market well, raising $2 billion at a valuation read more of $32 billion.

As with these other companies, some investors who have bought AMTD in the past month will undoubtedly lose money. But the company is likely to end up being better off for its 15 minutes of fame.

801,META,2022-10-05,Musk’s messy Twitter deal could have an X-factor,"













NEW YORK, Oct 5 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elon Musk’s $44 billion Twitter (TWTR.N) deal is a mess in the making. That’s true both for the Tesla (TSLA.O) chief, whose agreed price looks too rich amid a market crash, and for his bankers, who must pony up the debt. But combining Twitter with Musk’s other ventures could be a game-changer — if his attention doesn’t wander.

Hours after Musk offered to buy the social network, reviving a deal he’d previously tried to nix, he tweeted that Twitter could be “an accelerant to creating X, the everything app.” Such an app already exists, though not in Musk’s home market. China’s WeChat pulls together messaging, payments, lending, and its own app store. WeChat dominates China, where its “mini” apps underpin a $240 billion marketplace.

loading

But such apps haven’t taken off in the United States, where Apple’s iPhone holds over 50% market share, according to Counterpoint Research. Apple’s heft helps it corral users into its own services, like iMessage or Apple Pay. Even Meta Platforms’ (META.O) WhatsApp, a messaging service used by billions worldwide, draws only 17% of U.S. teens, according to Pew Research.

Musk has a couple of things even WeChat doesn’t have, though. For example: A rapidly growing global fleet of Tesla vehicles that could potentially create a new way into a Musk-app universe. Apple (AAPL.O) is investing in the idea of cars as a platform, via “Project Titan” and CarPlay, its vehicle operating system. General Motors (GM.N) and Ford Motor say electric cars can be a funnel for selling services. Musk’s Tesla is the runaway leader in electric cars; he even theorizes that it could evolve into a fleet of self-driving robotaxis.

Then there’s SpaceX, already partnering with wireless carrier T-Mobile US (TMUS.O) to provide coverage from its Starlink satellite system. Combining this telecom backbone with transportation and in-app communications becomes potentially more powerful still, and is something that’s easier to do as a part of a privately held corporate empire than a red-tape-bound listed company.

This is all pie in the sky for now, even if the Twitter takeover does actually close. Musk has a tendency to get distracted, lapsing back into follies like provoking the Securities and Exchange Commission or tweeting poop emojis. But if Tesla’s market capitalization of $735 billion shows anything, it’s that investors put enormous value on Musk’s ability to one day turn a pipe dream into reality.

802,META,2023-03-17,"SpaceX, Netflix, Boeing to join ""biggest-ever"" US business mission to Vietnam","













HANOI, March 17 (Reuters) - SpaceX, Netflix and Boeing are among the companies joining the ""biggest-ever"" U.S. business mission to Vietnam next week to discuss investment and sales opportunities in the booming Southeast Asian nation, the organiser said.

More than 50 companies, including defence, pharmaceutical and tech firms, will participate in the mission organised by the US-ASEAN Business Council, an industry body, according to a list seen by Reuters.

The delegation is a sign of rising interest in the global manufacturing hub, which is benefiting from a shift away from China amid Sino-U.S. trade friction.

Vietnam, with a population of 100 million people, also has a rapidly-growing consumer market as its middle class expands.

""This is the biggest-ever mission in Vietnam,"" said Vu Tu Thanh, the US-ASEAN Business Council's representative in the country, noting that the body had been organising these events for three decades.

Streaming giant Netflix (NFLX.O), which Reuters last month reported was planning to open an office in Vietnam, is among the companies joining the trip. Netflix did not respond to a request for comment.

Aerospace manufacturers Boeing (BA.N), Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) and Bell (TXT.N) will hold meetings with state-owned Vietnamese defence procurement companies, Thanh told Reuters, adding that it was the first time in about a decade that security firms had decided to join the annual mission to Vietnam.

In December, the same companies held talks with Vietnamese government officials about the possible sale of helicopters and drones, as the country seeks new suppliers and the Ukraine conflict strains the capabilities of Russia, for decades Vietnam's main military partner.

""Helicopters is one of the things the companies hope to sell to the Vietnamese,"" Thanh said, although he cautioned that defence deals took time to be completed and no immediate breakthrough was expected.

Boeing said in a statement that its discussions with officials would focus on its growing partnership with Vietnam and ways to strengthen the country's aviation and defence capabilities.

Lockheed Martin and Bell did not respond to requests for comment.

The majority of the companies joining the business mission already have a business or manufacturing presence in Vietnam, including Apple (AAPL.O), Coca-Cola (KO.N) and PepsiCo (PEP.O), Thanh said, with some planning to expand it.

Some companies are also coming to get a better sense of the political situation after recent turmoil in the Communist-Party led country, including the resignation of the president in January, Thanh added.

Participants will have meetings with Vietnam's top political and regulatory leadership, including with Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh.

Thanh said some companies were interested in Vietnam as a manufacturing hub and in providing services to increasingly wealthy consumers at a time when economic growth reached more than 8% last year.

Among them is SpaceX, which is looking to sell its satellite internet services to Vietnam and other countries in the region, Thanh said. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.

The mission will also include semiconductors companies, pharmaceutical giants Pfizer (PFE.N) and Johnson & Johnson (PFE.N), medical device maker Abbott (ABT.N), financial firms Visa (V.N) and Citibank (C.N), internet and cloud companies Meta (META.O) and Amazon Web Services (AMZN.O), the list showed.

803,META,2023-01-27,Analysis: Google faces greater threat of forced ad unit sale from U.S. lawsuit,"[1/2] The logo for Google LLC is seen at the Google Store Chelsea in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., November 17, 2021. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly//File Photo















Jan 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. government is more likely to force Google (GOOGL.O) to divest a key business with an antitrust lawsuit it filed this week than a group of states that has pursued a similar case for three years, legal experts said.

The complaint filed Tuesday in a Virginia federal court by the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division attempts to compel Google to sell part of its advertising technology unit.

The suit mirrors allegations in another antitrust case brought against Google in New York federal court by a Texas-led coalition of 17 states in 2020. Both suits accuse the Alphabet Inc-owned company of abusing its dominance in online advertising, which Google has vigorously denied.

A court would be more likely to order structural changes in a company with nationwide impact if the U.S. government were making the argument, not just a group of states, the experts said.

“To the extent that any federal court is going to be in the business of breaking up Google, it’s going to be a lot more comfortable doing that if the plaintiff is the federal government,” said Vanderbilt University law professor Rebecca Haw Allensworth.

Still, Allensworth and other experts were skeptical that a court would force the sale of a business unit at a company as large and central to the economy as Google. Google's ad-tech business accounted for roughly 12% of the company’s revenue in 2021 and plays a vital role in its overall sales.

In the states' case, a New York federal judge in September rejected Google’s bid to dismiss it entirely. But the court disallowed some of the claims, including allegations that the company struck an illegal cooperation agreement with Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc (META.O).

The states' suit asks for any remedies the court deems appropriate, and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has said all possible punishments are on the table. The Justice Department's suit seeks at minimum the sale of Google’s ad manager suite, among other things.

The federal ""complaint has a degree of specificity that the other Google complaint does not,"" New York University law professor Harry First said. ""That indicates to me that they are very serious about actually changing the structure of Google's ad tech business.""

The Texas Attorney General's Office did not respond to a request for comment while the Justice Department declined to comment. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

States periodically sue companies for alleged violations of antitrust law, but the federal government sometimes either intervenes directly or files its own suit to assert its nationwide perspective.

Legal experts said that while judges don't always defer to the federal government when it steps into state antitrust disputes, the opinions of the DOJ and U.S. Federal Trade Commission can factor heavily in their decisions.

For example, after New York and 12 other states sued to block the merger of wireless carriers T-Mobile and Sprint in 2019, the U.S. government argued the deal should go forward because it would improve wireless coverage in rural areas.

In that case, the DOJ urged the court to give weight to its “uniform, nationwide perspective"" and deny the states' request for an injunction blocking the deal. The court agreed, and the merger later went through with certain conditions in a separate settlement brokered by the Justice Department.

“If the ultimate goal is to change the structure of the company, the federal government is in a much stronger position,” Syracuse University law professor Shubha Ghosh said.

Google also faces two largely parallel antitrust lawsuits by states and the federal government alleging unlawful dominance in online searching. The company has denied those allegations as well.

Summary Law firms

Law firms Related documents Denver solo practitioner blamed time management, computer woes on late file

Sanctions came amid wave of other penalties on some lawyers in 2020 election lawsuits















(Reuters) - A Colorado lawyer contesting a $187,000 sanction tied to his failed lawsuit over the 2020 election has asked a U.S. appeals court to accept his late-filed legal challenge, as he blamed his time management and computer-related woes.

The attorney, solo practitioner Gary Fielder, missed an April 1 deadline to file his opening legal papers in the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. He filed his brief a day later in which he argued that a judge's order that he and another lawyer pay legal fees to defendants in the lawsuit, including voting machine manufacturer Dominion Voting Systems Corp, was ""unreasonable.""

Whether the appeals court takes up his legal fees case remains to be determined. Fielder had twice earlier in February and March sought and received an extension to file the opening brief, and the appeals court set last Friday as the deadline. Failure to meet deadlines can doom a case.

""Counsel stayed up through the night to finish the necessary documents, including those attached to the opening brief,"" Fielder told the appeals court in a filing on Thursday. ""Unfortunately, as always seems to be the case, computer problems and formatting issues caused substantial delay, as well.""

The legal-fee sanction came amid a broader wave of reprimand against some lawyers who filed lawsuits questioning the outcome of the 2020 election in which Democrat Joe Biden prevailed against his Republican rival Donald Trump.

Judges in some cases questioned attorney ethics, and imposed legal fees as punishment, for bringing what were widely seen as frivolous lawsuits. Defendants in the Colorado case sought sanctions against the plaintiffs.

In November, U.S. Magistrate Judge N. Reid Neureiter ordered Fielder and co-counsel Ernest Walker to pay fees to the defendants after dismissing an ""arguably frivolous and groundless case."" Walker did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

Fielder told Reuters in an email that ""seeking to file a motion or brief slightly out of time is not unusual."" He added: ""A brief filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals is an important matter and must be done right. Accordingly, sometimes it is just impossible to get all the pieces filed before the midnight deadline.""

Fielder told the appeals court that defendants including Dominion, Meta Platforms Inc and the state of Pennsylvania did not take a position on his request to file out of time. Another defendant, Center for Tech and Civic Life, objected to the late filing.

In asking for earlier extensions, Fielder cited a pending medical procedure and the ""overwhelming press of business as a solo practitioner."" He also argued that accepting his out-of-time brief will not harm the defendants.

The case is Kevin O'Rourke v. Dominion Voting Systems Inc et al, 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-1442.

For plaintiffs: Gary Fielder and Ernest Walker

For Dominion: Stanley Garnett of Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck

805,META,2023-02-02,Illinois top court endorses five-year window for biometric privacy claims,"Summary

Summary Law firms Longer period to sue in line with privacy law's goals, court rules

Logistics firm, biz group pushed for one-year window















(Reuters) - The Illinois Supreme Court on Thursday said workers and consumers have five years to sue for violations of the state's unique biometric privacy law, rejecting a much narrower window pushed by business groups.

The court in a 5-0 ruling said that because the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) does not specify a statute of limitations for lawsuits, a five-year ""catchall"" period in the state code of civil procedure applies.

Logistics company Black Horse Carriers Inc, which is facing a proposed class action alleging BIPA violations, had argued that a one-year limitations period in the state code for lawsuits involving the publication of private information should apply to BIPA claims.

But the high court said that a five-year statute of limitations would better effectuate the law's stated goal of addressing the risks to the public surrounding the disclosure of highly sensitive biometric information.

Lawyers for Black Horse did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. Nor did lawyers for two truck drivers who had sued the company.

The Illinois Chamber of Commerce had filed an amicus brief last March warning that a five-year window would increase companies' exposure to ""potentially catastrophic damages"" in BIPA cases.

Nearly 2,000 lawsuits alleging violations of BIPA have been filed since 2017, yielding a series of massive settlements and judgments.

Meta Platforms Inc's Facebook in 2020 agreed to pay $650 million to settle a BIPA class action involving its use of facial recognition software. The company denied wrongdoing.

In October, following the first-ever trial in a BIPA case, a jury ordered BNSF Railway Co to pay $228 million for collecting truck drivers' fingerprints without their consent. The railroad has moved for a new trial, saying the award was unreasonable.

The BIPA, adopted in 2008, requires companies that collect biometric information such as fingerprints and retinal scans to obtain permission beforehand and to notify workers and consumers of how that information will be used.

It is the only law in the U.S. that grants a private right of action to sue over the mishandling of biometric information.

The 2019 proposed class action against Black Horse claims the company failed to obtain written consent before obtaining drivers' fingerprints and sharing them with a third party contractor.

A mid-level appeals court in a novel 2021 ruling said the limitations period is one year for BIPA claims alleging unlawful disclosure and five years for claims involving notice, consent or retention. Black Horse appealed.

On Thursday, Justice P. Scott Neville wrote for the Illinois Supreme Court that applying different limitations periods to distinct BIPA claims ""would create an unclear, inconvenient, inconsistent, and potentially unworkable regime.""

The court remanded the case to a state judge for further proceedings.

The case is Tims v. Black Horse Carriers Inc, Illinois Supreme Court, No. 127801.

For the plaintiffs: Ryan Stephan and James Zouras of Stephan Zouras

For Black Horse: David Schultz of Hinshaw & Culbertson

806,META,2022-04-24,Box Office: 'The Bad Guys' Topples 'Fantastic Beasts 3' With $24 Million Debut,"













LOS ANGELES, April 24, (Variety.com) - Universal's kid-friendly caper ""The Bad Guys"" pulled off a heist for the ages, capturing the No. 1 spot at the domestic box office.

The animated comedy has collected $24 million from 4,009 North American theaters in its debut, enough to take the crown from ""Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore."" In its second weekend of release, the latest chapter in the ""Harry Potter"" prequel series plummeted to third place with $14 million, a troubling sign for the Warner Bros.' Wizarding film franchise.

""The Bad Guys"" may have towered over the competition, but it was not the only newcomer to movie theater marquees. ""The Northman,"" a blood-soaked Viking epic from director Robert Eggers, and ""The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent,"" a meta comedy in which Nicolas Cage plays a fictionalized version of himself, opened in theaters nationwide to varying results. With three original movies in wide release, this weekend indicates that Hollywood does, indeed, still have new ideas -- but audiences aren't always willing to make the trek to watch them.

""The Bad Guys"" carries a $70 million price tag, so although the Dreamworks Animation film has topped the box office, it may have to claw its way to profitability in its theatrical run. The international box office will be critical to getting into the black. Already, the movie has grossed $63 million overseas, bringing its global tally to $87.1 million. It helps that in addition to strong reviews, audiences appear to be high on the film, which secured an ""A"" CinemaScore from ticket buyers. Sam Rockwell, Marc Maron, Anthony Ramos, Craig Robinson and Awkwafina lead the voice cast of ""The Bad Guys,"" which follows a crackerjack crew of animal outlaws as they attempt their most challenging con yet -- becoming model citizens.

""The Northman"" opened in fourth place, generating $12 million from 3,865 locations. That's a great result for an arthouse film, but alas, ""The Northman"" does not carry the budget of an arthouse film. The movie reportedly cost $90 million, though sources close to the production say the final number was closer to $70 million after factoring in tax incentives. And Focus Features, who split the cost with New Regency, did not skimp on promotional efforts. ""The Northman"" has posters with stars Alexander Skarsg?rd, Nicole Kidman, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ethan Hawke, Bj?rk and Willem Dafoe plastered in Times Square.

""Reviews are excellent, but with a budget of around $75 million, 'The Northman' will struggle to recover costs,"" said David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research.

""The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent,"" from Lionsgate, took the No. 5 spot with $7.1 million, a wobbly start given its reported $30 million budget. Directed by Tom Gormican, the wacky buddy comedy of sorts follows Cage, whose star is declining as a billionaire super fan (played by Pedro Pascal) offers him $1 million to attend a birthday party in the Maldives. When events take a turn, Cage teams up with the CIA and channels his most beloved movie characters to save his family from his biggest fan, who may be a dangerous arms dealer.

Despite stacked competition, Paramount's family friendly sequel ""Sonic the Hedgehog 2"" sped past ""Fantastic Beasts 3"" and others to land in second place with $15.2 million from 3,809 venues. After three weeks in theaters, the ""Sonic"" follow-up has generated a mighty $145.8 million. The film is less than $3 million away from surpassing its predecessor's $148 million pre-pandemic domestic box office total, though 2020's ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" likely would have enjoyed a longer run on the big screen without COVID-19 spoiling those plans.

807,META,2022-10-04,"PlayStation eyes new investment for PC, mobile push","













TOKYO, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Sony Group Corp's (6758.T) gaming business is looking at fresh investment to bolster its push into PC and mobile, a senior executive said, as the PlayStation 5 maker competes for talent with deep-pocketed rivals and as industry dealmaking heats up.

""Further investments in areas that will strengthen the expansion on to PC, on to mobile and into live services, that's definitely a possibility for us,"" Hermen Hulst, head of PlayStation Studios, told Reuters in an interview without providing further detail.

Sony, whose studios are known for single player console games such as ""Spider-Man"" and ""God of War"", has outlined ambitious plans to release titles on PC and mobile and offer live service games, which provide continuous updated play.

The radical shift is reflected in its recent deals including the $3.6 billion acquisition of Bungie, the studio behind the multiplayer ""Destiny"" franchise, which Sony operates outside its PlayStation Studios network.

Other investments include the purchase of a minority stake in Japanese developer FromSoftware, whose action role playing game ""Elden Ring"" has sold more than 16.6 million units.

""You should think of collaborations on the game development side first and foremost, but it's also not unthinkable with our PlayStation Productions efforts that we explore opportunities,"" Hulst said of the FromSoftware investment.

Sony is producing a growing number of game adaptations, with this year's ""Uncharted"" movie grossing more than $400 million globally and a TV series based on ""The Last of Us"" franchise from its Naughty Dog studio launching on HBO next year.

Hulst, who is based in the Netherlands and took up his post in 2019, has overseen the growth of PlayStation Studios to 19 studios, with additions including Nixxes, which ports console games to PC, and mobile developer Savage Game Studios.

KEY DIFFERENTIATOR

Given the scope of the transformation targeted by the gaming business, analysts expect further dealmaking from Sony.

""I think that they're still going to add studios,"" said Serkan Toto, founder of the Kantan Games consultancy.

The strength of PlayStation's studio network has drawn praise as a key differentiator with Xbox maker Microsoft (MSFT.O), which is trying to buy Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O).

Sony gaming chief Jim Ryan has raised objection about the $69 billion mega-deal's potential impact on PlayStation users.

""If Sony can pull off what they did with single player experiences but (as) multiplayer experiences across platforms, on the PC, on consoles and maybe even on the phone, then all bets are off,"" said Toto, pointing to the success of online games such as Fortnite from Epic Games.

Sony's push on to other platforms comes as it has struggled to produce enough PlayStation 5 units due to supply chain snarls. Its in-house studios are also developing titles for the next generation PlayStation VR2 headset, due to launch early next year.

Such headsets, which have attracted investment from players including Facebook parent Meta (META.O), are yet to break through and become a primary method for playing games. Pricing for the device has not been announced.

While ""Horizon Forbidden West"", which launched in February, is ""an open world and that's not necessarily very suitable to a PSVR2 game,"" Sony is designing ""bespoke"" titles such as ""Horizon Call of the Mountain"" for the system, Hulst said.

NEW YORK, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Strong earnings are helping energy stocks extend this year's torrid run, furthering their contrast with the tech-focused megacaps whose disappointing results have battered their shares.

A standout all year, the S&P 500 energy sector (.SPNY) is up 26% in October alone, against an 8% rise for the overall S&P 500 (.SPX). Oil majors Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Chevron (CVX.N) are up roughly 29% and 27% for the month, respectively, with oilfield services firm Halliburton (HAL.N) jumping 47%.

For the year, the energy sector has soared nearly 65%. It's the only one of 11 S&P 500 sectors in positive territory so far in 2022, with the broader index down about 19%, and heavyweight stocks such as Amazon (AMZN.O) and Tesla (TSLA.O) pounded as Federal Reserve rate hikes clobber asset prices.

“The reason why they have been rallying ... is earnings have been really, really strong,” said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco. There is ""a lot of momentum in that space, and a lot of people just rushing to what’s working.”

S&P 500 energy companies are on pace to have increased earnings by 135% in the third quarter from the year-earlier period, according to Refinitiv IBES. Overall S&P 500 earnings are expected to have climbed just 4%. Indeed, excluding energy's contribution, S&P 500 earnings are set to have declined 3.5% in the quarter, according to IBES.

The sector's earnings power was on full display last Friday, when Exxon and Chevron both posted results that smashed estimates.

Chevron posted a net profit of $11.2 billion, almost double the $6.1 billion from the same period last year. Exxon's $19.66 billion third-quarter net profit was nearly as much as the $20.7 billion for Apple (AAPL.O), the largest U.S. company by market value.

Reuters Graphics

By contrast last week, companies that have heavy weights in stock indexes, including Amazon, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META.O) posted results that soundly disappointed investors.

Energy companies are benefiting from rising oil and gas prices, with U.S. crude prices up 16% so far this year.

Companies are also demonstrating cost and capital-spending discipline, said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management.

""If money does follow earnings, then it makes sense at least that the sector continues to do well,” Nolte said.

With its recent gains, the S&P's energy sector was approaching its June peak, which was the highest the sector has reached since 2014.

Because of its outperformance this year, the 23-component sector now makes up about 5.3% of the weight of the S&P 500, nearly twice as much as at the end of 2021.

Despite their increase this year, oil prices are well off their highs from earlier in 2022, and another jolt up could drive shares of the companies even further, Nolte said.

But Lip said after a strong 2022, the firms may have trouble topping their earnings performance in future quarters. Indeed, energy sector earnings are expected to decline 11.5% in 2023, according to IBES data.

""The way that Wall Street works is, 'show me the money' in terms of earnings growth, and you are just not going to see it in energy companies going forward,"" Lip said. ""It’s just a lot harder comps.”

Dec 1 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended mixed on Thursday as a selloff in Salesforce weighed on the Dow, while traders digested U.S. data that suggested the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes are working.

On Wednesday, the S&P 500 surged over 3% on optimism the Fed might moderate its campaign of interest rate hikes.

U.S. manufacturing activity shrank in November for the first time in 2-1/2 years as higher borrowing costs weighed on demand for goods, data showed, evidence the Fed's rate hikes have cooled the economy.

The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.3%, the same as in September, and over the 12 months through October the index increased 6.0% after advancing 6.3% the prior month.

Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index rose 0.2%, one-tenth less than expected, after gaining 0.5% in September.

""On a normal day, the package of data this morning would be pretty risk-on, but after the rally yesterday, I think it's not quite good enough to push another leg higher,"" said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategy analyst at Baird. Wednesday's rally drove the S&P 500 index (.SPX) above its 200-day moving average for the first time since April after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said it was time to slow the pace of interest rate hikes.

Traders now see a 79% chance the Fed will increase its key benchmark rate by 50 basis points in December and a 21% chance it will hike rates by 75 basis points.

Salesforce Inc (CRM.N) tumbled 8.3% after the software maker said Bret Taylor would step down as co-chief executive officer in January.

The Nasdaq gained 0.13% to 11,482.45 points, lifted by gains of over 1% each in Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (META.O).

Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.56% to 34,396.53 points, pulled lower by Salesforce.

Of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes, seven declined, led lower by financials (.SPSY), down 0.71%, followed by a 0.47% loss in consumer staples (.SPLRCS).

A U.S. Labor Department report on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 225,000 for the week ended Nov. 26.

Investors now await nonfarm payrolls data on Friday for clues about how rate hikes have affected the labor market.

With a month left in 2022, the S&P 500 is down about 14% year to date, and the Nasdaq has lost about 27%.

Indexes: S&P 500 -2.08%, Nasdaq -2.48%, Dow -1.95%















Nov 9 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply lower on Wednesday as Republican gains in midterm elections appeared more modest than some expected, with investors also focusing on upcoming inflation data that will provide clues about the severity of future interest rate hikes.

Republicans were still favored to win control of the House of Representatives but key races were too close to call, with a better-than-expected showing by Democrats diminishing the prospect of a so-called red wave of Republican gains.

""What was really more expected in the market was a red wave,"" said Jay Hatfield, CEO of Infrastructure Capital Management in New York. ""I think we were in a unique situation where the more the Republicans won, the better off the market would have been. At least there would have been some stocks strongly rallying, like defense and energy stocks.""

Also hurting sentiment, Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) tumbled 13% - its biggest one-day drop since 2001 - after the entertainment heavyweight reported more losses from its push into streaming video.

Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) dropped 7.2% to a two-year low after Chief Executive Elon Musk late on Tuesday disclosed that he sold $3.95 billion worth of shares in the electric-vehicle maker days after he closed the $44 billion deal for Twitter Inc.

Clean energy shares, which typically benefit under a Democratic leadership, rose, with the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN.P) up almost 1%.

Wednesday's drop on Wall Street ended a three-day rally in which the S&P 500 had gained almost 3%.

With the election outcome still uncertain, investors were turning their attention to October inflation data due out on Thursday, which could shed more light on whether the Fed might soften its aggressive stance on interest rate hikes.

""CPI is one of the more important inputs in terms of the inflation environment. You'd be hard-pressed to find many investors that want to make a big bet in front of (the report),"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial.

Major indexes added to declines as Treasury yields climbed further after a poor auction of 10-year notes by the U.S. Treasury. Treasury yields reversed and fell later in the day.

SYDNEY, Feb 23 (Reuters) - An Australian regulator has sent legal letters to Twitter and Google telling them to hand over information about their efforts to stop online child abuse, drawing them into a crackdown that has already put pressure on other global tech firms.

The action by the country's e-safety commissioner keeps a spotlight on the anti-exploitation practices at Twitter under the ownership of billionaire Elon Musk, who called child protection his top priority while also laying off more than half its employees since taking over last October.

""With Elon Musk declaring child sexual abuse a top priority, this is an opportunity for him to explain what he is indeed doing,"" e-safety commissioner Julie Inman Grant told Reuters in an interview, referring to several of Musk's tweets.

She said it was in Twitter's interests to show that it was acting effectively to eradicate child sexual abuse material, otherwise advertisers could turn away from the company.

Inman Grant, who had served as a public policy director for Twitter until 2016, said the responses of larger tech firms, coupled with reports of looser content moderation at Twitter since Musk took over, prompted her to take action.

Twitter closed its Australian office after Musk's buyout so there was no local representative to respond to Reuters, and a request for comment sent to the San Francisco-based company's media email address was not immediately answered.

Apart from writing to Twitter, the commissioner also sent letters to Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, owner of YouTube and the file storage unit Google Drive, and China's TikTok.

Google's senior manager of government affairs and public policy Samantha Yorke said abuse material had no place on the company's platforms and ""we utilise a range of industry standard scanning techniques including hash-matching technology and artificial intelligence to identify and remove (child abuse material) that has been uploaded to our services"".

TikTok's policy manager for Australia Jed Horner said in a statement the company had a zero-tolerance approach to dissemination of abuse material with more than 40,000 safety professionals globally ""who develop and enforce our policies, and build processes and technologies to detect, remove or restrict violative content at scale"".

Under new laws in Australia, the e-safety commissioner, an office set up to protect internet users, can compel internet companies to give detailed information about the frequency of child exploitation on their platforms and about measures they take to stamp it out.

Companies that fail to cooperate face fines of up to A$700,000 ($478,000) per day.

Last year, the commissioner sent similar notices to Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O). After receiving their responses, the commissioner called their practices inadequate. read more

Inman Grant said a 2020 joint investigation with the Canadian Centre for Child Protection found widespread publicly-available abuse material on Twitter, which those authorities reported to Twitter's head of trust and safety.

""When you compound that with Elon Musk coming here, eviscerating the trust and safety team, but also cutting the local public policy externally-facing folks, and then allowing some of the worst of the worst actors back on, you're going to have a lot of bad actors, fewer guardrails,"" she said, commenting on the job cuts at Twitter.

Although Twitter had effectively closed its Australian unit, Inman Grant said her office had extra-territorial powers to fine companies abroad, but she hoped the public attention would prompt Twitter to cooperate.

814,META,2022-05-19,"EXCLUSIVE TikTok plans big push into gaming, conducting tests in Vietnam -sources","













HONG KONG/HANOI, May 19 (Reuters) - TikTok has been conducting tests so users can play games on its video-sharing app in Vietnam, part of plans for a major push into gaming, four people familiar with the matter said.

Featuring games on its platform would boost advertising revenue as well as the amount of time users spend on the app - one of the world's most popular with more than 1 billion monthly active users.

Boasting a tech-savvy population with 70% of its citizens under the age of 35, Vietnam is an attractive market for social media platforms such as TikTok, Meta Platforms Inc's (FB.O) Facebook and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) YouTube and Google.

TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, also plans to roll out gaming more widely in Southeast Asia, the people said. That move could come as early as the third quarter, said two of them.

The sources declined to be identified as the information has yet to be publicly disclosed.

A TikTok representative said the company has tested bringing HTML5 games, a common form of minigame, to its app through tie-ups with third-party game developers and studios such as Zynga Inc (ZNGA.O). But it declined to comment on its plans for Vietnam or its broader gaming ambitions.

""We're always looking at ways to enrich our platform and regularly test new features and integrations that bring value to our community,"" the representative said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

ByteDance did not respond to a request for comment.

Reuters was not able to learn TikTok's plans for rolling out gaming features in other markets. Although TikTok users can watch games being streamed, in most regions they are not able to play games within the TikTok app.

In the United States, only a few games appear to have been launched including Zynga's ""Disco Loco 3D"", a music and dance challenge game and ""Garden of Good"", where players grow vegetables to trigger donations by TikTok to the non-profit Feeding America.

According to two sources, TikTok plans to draw primarily on ByteDance's suite of games.

While the company will start with minigames, which tend to have simple game play mechanisms and a short playing time, its gaming ambitions extend beyond that, said one of the people who had direct knowledge of the matter.

TikTok will require a licence to feature games on its platform in Vietnam where authorities restrict games depicting gambling, violence, and sexual content. The process is expected to go smoothly as the games planned are not controversial, the person said.

Vietnam's foreign and communications ministries did not respond to requests for comment.

Users of ByteDance's Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, have been able to play games on the platform since 2019.

TikTok's games are likely to carry advertisements from the start, with revenue split between ByteDance and game developers, a separate source said.

TikTok's foray into games mirrors similar efforts made by major tech firms seeking to retain users. Facebook launched Instant Games in 2016 and streaming firm Netflix (NFLX.O) also recently added games to its platform.

It also marks the latest ByteDance effort to establish itself as a major contender in gaming. It acquired Shanghai-based gaming studio Moonton Technology last year, putting it in direct competition with Tencent (0700.HK), China's biggest gaming firm.

Even without gaming, TikTok has seen advertising revenue surge. Its advertising revenue is likely to triple this year to more than $11 billion, exceeding the combined sales of Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Snap Inc (SNAP.N), according to research firm Insider Intelligence. read more

815,META,2023-02-22,Explainer: How Microsoft is addressing antitrust concerns over Activision deal,"













BRUSSELS, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) has thrown the gauntlet down over antitrust criticisms, saying on Tuesday it is ready to offer rivals licensing deals in exchange for regulatory approval of its $69 billion deal to purchase video game publisher Activision (ATVI.O), but it would not to sell the latter's lucrative ""Call of Duty"" franchise.

WHAT IS THE ACTIVISION DEAL?

Microsoft announced the Activision bid in January last year, its biggest ever, to boost its firepower in the booming videogaming market and take on leaders Tencent (0700.HK) and Sony (6758.T), and lay the base for its investment in metaverse, digital spaces which are made more lifelike by the use of virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR).

WHAT DO ANTITRUST REGULATORS SAY?

In December, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) asked a judge to block the deal, saying it would give Microsoft's Xbox exclusive access to Activision games and leave out Sony's Playstation and Nintendo consoles.

The UK competition agency CMA has suggested divesting Call of Duty to address its concerns while the European Commission has warned Microsoft about the possible anti-competitive impact of the deal.

WHO ARE THE CRITICS AND FANS OF THE DEAL?

Market leader Sony wants the deal to be blocked. A group of 10 gamers in the United States has filed a private consumer antitrust lawsuit over the deal.

The European Games Development Federation, with more than 2,500 game studios in 22 European countries, and the UNI Global Union back the acquisition.

WHAT HAS MICROSOFT PRESIDENT SAID AND OFFERED?

Microsoft President Brad Smith said he doesn't think ""it is feasible or realistic to think that one game or one slice of this company (Activision) can be carved out and separated from the rest"" and that he doesn't ""see a viable path to sell the Activision studio for the quality of the game to someone else.""

Smith said the CMA has a choice to either kill the deal and cement Sony's 80% market share in Europe or clear it with behavioural remedies such as the licensing deals with Nintendo and Nvidia that will bring Call of Duty to 150 more million people.

WHAT ARE THE NINTENDO AND NVIDIA LICENSING DEALS?

Both companies have signed 10-year licensing deals that will bring Call of Duty to their gaming platforms but these are conditional on the Activision deal being approved.

WILL MICROSOFT'S TACTIC WORK?

Behavioral remedies like licensing deals are a hard sell for the CMA which flexed its muscles in 2021 when it ordered Facebook owner Meta to sell animated-images platform Giphy after the deal had been completed.

The European Commission could be more open to such remedies if they can allay their concerns, but it is still too early to tell.

WHO HAS GIVEN THE GREEN LIGHT SO FAR?

Brazil, Chile, Serbia and Saudi Arabia have given unconditional approval.

WHAT NEXT?

The EU antitrust enforcer's decision is due by April 11 but the deadline can be extended depending on when remedies are offered.

The CMA has given Microsoft until 1700 GMT Feb. 22 to comment on possible remedies, with a response hearing possible by early March, final submissions and responses in March and April 26 for a final report.

Microsoft's Smith said the company would fight the FTC's request to block the deal.

April 27 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) forecast third-quarter revenue above analyst expectations after beating second quarter revenue and profit estimates on Wednesday, largely due to its move to focus on a growing non-handset business to cushion a likely hit from slowing smartphone demand.

The robust earnings outlook and record quarterly revenue for the last quarter immediately pushed Qualcomm shares up about 5% in after-hours trading.

Lockdowns in China, war in Ukraine and rising inflation has taken a toll on consumers, preventing them from spending on electronic gadgets like phones. However, Qualcomm has not been affected so far.

""The market in China is changing a bit. I think we're kind of less impacted by it because we're really focused on the premium and high-tier"" smartphone market, Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon told Reuters.

Runar Bjørhovde, an analyst at research firm Canalys, said smartphone makers will want to focus on selling more profitable high-end phones as the supply chain constrains production, while consumers will want to buy cheap phones as inflation and uncertainty hold them back from spending.

He said the ""sweet spot"" will be in the mid-range devices ($300-$800), where Qualcomm has a strong hold and excellent partnerships with the vendors who dominate this market segment.

Qualcomm's strong results coupled with Meta Platforms' (FB.O) surprising profit beat pushed Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) shares up about 1% in after-hours trading, providing glimmers of hope for a solid showing when the iPhone maker reveals results on Thursday.

""These (Qualcomm) results lay the foundation to make a strong case that the smartphone business is still strong after the traditionally big holiday quarter,"" said Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, adding that Qualcomm derives 25% of its sales from making modem solutions for Apple.

But Apple is working on its own chips to replace Qualcomm's. Analysts have said Qualcomm is preparing for the inevitable.

""Qualcomm is certainly relying on the Android market, leaning into it heavily as they anticipate losing Apple's business for its modem chips. Within Android, Samsung is the clear leader in premium handsets, and will likely be an important customer for Qualcomm in the future,"" said Logan Purk, an analyst at Edward Jones.

In the company's earnings call, Amon said he expects the ""relationship with Samsung only to increase,"" adding that in the latest Samsung Galaxy S22 smartphone about 75% of the high-end chips were Qualcomm chips, up from about 40% in Samsung's last phone, and replacing Samsung chips.

Still to reduce its dependence on handsets, Qualcomm has been diversifying its revenue streams by catering to other markets including automotive.

For example, Qualcomm's automotive business pipeline is now at $16 billion, up from $13 billion late last year, mostly thanks to a deal it struck recently with automaker Stellantis, said Amon. read more

Revenue from chips catering to automotive and internet-powered gadgets rose 41% and 61%, respectively, during the second quarter, while revenue from its mainstay handset business rose 56%, helped by the new Snapdragon launch.

Amon also told Reuters that Qualcomm is open to participating in an IPO by Arm Ltd, which makes blueprints that chipmakers, including Qualcomm, use to design chips. SoftBank Group Corp(9984.T) owns the British chip technology company.

Qualcomm forecast current-quarter revenue between a range of $10.5 billion and $11.3 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $9.98 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Adjusted revenue for the quarter ended March 27 was $11.16 billion, above estimates of $10.6 billion.

Excluding items, Qualcomm earned $3.21 per share, beating estimates of $2.91.

Summary Companies Server chip demand remains solid on cloud appetite -analysts

Smartphone demand slows as inflation rises -analysts

Strong dollar likely aided profits -analysts















SEOUL, July 7 (Reuters) - South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) turned in its best April-June profit since 2018 on Thursday, underpinned by strong sales of memory chips to server customers even as demand from inflation-hit smartphone makers cools.

Shares of the world's largest memory-chip and smartphone maker closed up 3.2% after preliminary results were announced, versus a 1.8% rise in the wider market (.KS11).

Shares of other chipmakers, including rival SK Hynix (000660.KS) and the world's biggest foundry TSMC (2330.TW), also rose as analysts said tight supply of certain chips could help offset slower demand that is driving down memory chip prices.

Samsung posted an operating profit of 14 trillion won ($10.7 billion), up 11% from 12.57 trillion won a year earlier, just shy of a 14.45 trillion won SmartEstimate from Refinitiv.

Revenue for the second quarter rose 21% to 77 trillion won, in line with market estimates.

The strong quarter for Samsung comes at a time when other chipmakers have warned of a looming chip glut at customers who stocked up during the pandemic to meet higher demand from people working from home.

Chipmakers including Micron (MU.O) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) have also recently signalled waning demand as red-hot inflation squeezes spending. read more

""Memory chipmakers are expected to build inventory this year, keeping supply conservative, and hike shipments when prices rebound and demand recovers next year"", said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment & Securities.

Prices of specific DRAM chips, used in devices and servers, fell about 12% last month from a year ago, according to data provider TrendForce. Prices of NAND Flash chips, used for data storage, are also projected to fall as much as 5% in the July-September period from the previous quarter.

SMARTPHONE DEMAND WEAKENS

Rising inflation, concerns about a downturn in major markets, the war in Ukraine and China's COVID-19 lockdowns have resulted in slowing smartphone sales, leaving server chip demand as the only bright spot, analysts said.

Samsung's profits have been shielded as large U.S. tech firms such as Amazon (AMZN.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google and Meta (META.O) that use a lot of data centre services kept buying chips to meet cloud demand, they added.

Making a case for strong server demand, Taiwanese contract electronics supplier and Apple iPhone maker Foxconn (2317.TW) on Monday raised its full-year outlook and said it was optimistic about the third quarter. read more

A strong dollar, which hit a 20-year high, may have also aided Samsung's chip profits in the second quarter. read more

Samsung's chip sales are made mainly in dollars, while it reports its profit in Korean won, so a firm greenback translates to higher chip earnings.

Estimated smartphone shipments by Samsung's mobile business in the second quarter were about 62-64 million, about 5%-8% lower than a March estimate, Counterpoint Research said, as inflation hit smartphone demand.

Samsung shipped 74 million smartphones in the first quarter.

""This trend is the same for major global smartphone makers, although there is variance to some degree ... In particular, the hit to the demand for low- and mid-end smartphones seems more severe,"" said Jene Park, Senior analyst at Counterpoint.

Nov 9 (Reuters) - Scores of posts on Twitter and Facebook challenged Democratic successes in U.S. midterm elections without evidence on Wednesday, social media experts said, but the misinformation did not rise to the firestorm levels that followed President Joe Biden's victory in 2020.

Researchers who study misinformation are closely monitoring online discussion following Tuesday's voting, which will decide control of Congress. False narratives about fraud during the 2020 presidential race, promoted by then-President Donald Trump on Twitter, fueled a deadly siege of the Capitol. Trump was later banned from the social media service.

This time, far less prominent users on Twitter Inc and Meta Platform's (META.O) Facebook have been raising doubts about unsettled results in Arizona, citing voting machine problems and slow counting.

Overall, Republicans made modest gains nationwide but Democrats performed better than expected, and control of Congress hinged on a few races that remained too close to call as of Wednesday evening.

Some posts noted that Republicans won big in Florida after the state enacted new voting restrictions and claimed that the lack of such laws in other states resulted in fraud.

""We are seeing people drumming up the idea that Democratic success was the result of widespread fraud, but they don’t have much to hang it on,"" said the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project, which is monitoring social media.

So far, the conspiracy theories have not sparked major demonstrations or gone as viral as last time around.

""There's a bunch of balls frozen up in the air and we're just wondering when they are going to come down or if they have disappeared for good,"" said Mike Caulfield, a research scientist at University of Washington who is part of the Election Integrity Partnership consortium.

The partnership said some Republican commentators may be holding back on spreading fraud claims in states such as Arizona because the party is expected to come out partially victorious in those places and such claims could undermine their positive results.

Efforts by election officials and online misinformation experts to push back on misleading narratives on social media appeared to have worked better than in 2020, also helping curtail spread of false claims, partnership researchers said.

Actions taken by the social media services have been patchy.

Both Facebook and Twitter have systems to add context from fact-checking organizations to posts describing debunked election conspiracies. But none of this context appeared along several posts reviewed by Reuters that insinuated fraud.

Facebook also aims to restrict the spread of conspiratorial content by recommending it less, and problematic posts found by researchers had no more than a few hundred likes. But the company declined to comment on how well the feature worked this election, citing the ongoing ballot counting.

Common Cause, which monitors social media for voter suppression efforts, said on Tuesday that Twitter had taken no action on posts that the organization had flagged as inappropriate.

Twitter, now owned by billionaire Elon Musk, laid off roughly half its staff last week, including many employees responsible for curating and elevating credible information on the service.

Twitter did not respond to a request for comment.

Twitter did suspend a user who on Tuesday posted a video claiming a masked man was “cheating in front of the cameras” at a polling station in Philadelphia.

Seth Bluestein, city commissioner of Philadelphia, had tweeted that the video is false.

“I personally visited the East Passyunk Community Center polling place today,” Bluestein wrote. “The interior shot is not of a Philadelphia polling location, as you can see in these photos I just took tonight. This is another example of dangerous misinformation.”

819,META,2022-07-27,Analysis: Why Spotify's 'Car Thing' was destined for the hardware graveyard,"[1/2] The Spotify logo is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., May 3, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid















LOS ANGELES/STOCKHOLM, July 27 (Reuters) - Spotify Technology SA's (SPOT.N) Car Thing player is now a thing of the past.

The world's leading audio streaming service on Wednesday announced it would discontinue the device just five months after it became available to all users in the United States. read more In doing so, Spotify became the latest software technology company to stumble in an attempt to build hardware.

Spotify wrote down a $31 million investment in the device, which was aimed at increasing the number of users who listen to music or podcasts while in the car. However, the company said it was unable to sell enough devices at a sufficiently high price to justify the investment.

""We just can't get it to an attractive economical profile,"" Spotify CEO Daniel Ek told Reuters. ""So we decided to terminate this program in light of that.""

Car Thing was a next-generation stereo designed to stream Spotify's music and podcasts from the user's phone through the car audio system. After unveiling trials in May 2019, Spotify tested the device with a small group of people in April 2021, and then brought it to wider release in February this year.

Spotify was not the first software company to seek to extend its relationship with users into the physical world through devices.

Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google was one of the early software companies to venture into hardware experiments with some major failures, including Google Glass - a wearable Android device resembling eyeglasses, which displayed information in the user's field of vision.

Snap Inc (SNAP.N) shelved its original Spectacles, $130 sunglasses that transmitted video directly to the SnapChat app, back in 2017. It announced a new type of Spectacles last year, featuring augmented reality.

Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) Facebook plans to stop producing a consumer version of a videoconferencing device dubbed Portal, instead focusing on the business market. It also disappointed people with its phone that came out in 2013 in partnership with HTC. It launched to mixed reviews, with critics raising privacy concerns.

IDC research vice president Frank Gillett said he could not recall any content company making a successful transition to hardware.

By contrast, a hardware maker like Apple Inc (AAPL.O) was able to launch music and video services by building on its operating system and existing device relationship with consumers.

""When they created the iPod, they had people in the ecosystem,"" said Gillett, adding that launching a device without such an infrastructure ""is extremely challenging.""

While Spotify rules the music streaming niche, building a device for the car put it in a competitive arena with the likes of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto - both of which have the support of their own ecosystems of billions of devices.

Spotify said its device was not designed to challenge these entertainment systems, but rather to provide an easier way for its users - especially those with older model cars - to listen to music or podcasts.

However, Car Thing lacked the features of the other infotainment devices, from navigation to making calls, making it harder to justify the need for a device just for music. It also required free listeners to upgrade to premium subscription.

Spotify CFO Paul Vogel told investors on Wednesday in addition to pricing challenges, inflation drove up component costs and a chip shortage made it harder to obtain parts.

Veteran consumer electronics analyst Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies said consumers are reluctant to add devices to their cars when 98% of new cars in the United States come with Apple's CarPlay already installed.

""I remember thinking: 'This is dead in the water,'"" said Bajarin.

820,META,2023-01-16,"The Davos party returns, with the shakes","













DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 16 (Reuters Breakingviews) - There’s a hangover happening in Davos even though the party hasn’t yet started. The World Economic Forum’s annual winter shindig in the Swiss mountain resort, which kicks off on Monday, marks a return for glitzy parties and high-minded debates following a three-year hiatus. A record number of business leaders are set to make the trip, and the passage of commercial, private and government aircraft through Zurich’s airport suggests overall attendees are at pre-Covid-19 levels. Yet the direction for the future – and those who will lead it – is more clouded than ever.

Corporate and financial chieftains who skipped last May’s low-key Davos gathering are back. JPMorgan (JPM.N) boss Jamie Dimon, a regular at the conference, will be joined by Wall Street leaders including David Solomon of Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley’s (MS.N) James Gorman. Chevron (CVX.N) Chief Executive Mike Wirth and BP’s (BP.L) Bernard Looney will represent resurgent oil majors. All in all, the WEF expects to welcome some 2,700 leaders from 130 countries, including 370 public figures.

Yet the apparent return to business as usual only serves to highlight the changes that have taken place since the last full gathering of the Davos elite. The global pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have added more friction to the already creaking globalised world that Davos epitomised.

Meanwhile, the political leaders responsible for shaping the new order are mostly staying at home. U.S. President Joe Biden is not making the trip – unlike his predecessor. Though a smattering of U.S. Congress members are expected to come they are hardly well-known international figures. China’s most senior representative is Vice-Premier Liu He. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, grappling with a slowing economy and striking public sector workers, is also staying home.

A stroll down the Davos Promenade, the town’s main drag where countries and corporations temporarily take over storefronts, underscores the shift. Poland and Indonesia have a prominent presence, but other national delegations have quieter messages on display. Saudi Arabia has a few conspicuous banners touting NEOM, its futuristic economic zone. The United Arab Emirates is touting tolerance.

The cryptocurrency firms that were at previous gatherings are mostly muted, replaced by companies promoting technologies like the blockchain. The Medical Psychedelics House has been replaced by the India Inclusivity Lounge. Established technology companies like Workday (WDAY.O), Salesforce (CRM.N), Cisco (CSCO.O), Qualcomm (QCOM.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O) dominate the street scene. Perhaps the most striking new tenant is Manchester United (MANU.N), the English Premier League club which is seeking a buyer.

The shift is reflective of a world that has become introspective and less joined-up. As big companies diversify supply chains, governments and regions are competing hard for business. Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act is dangling subsidies for American manufacturing, encouraging governors like J.B. Pritzker of Illinois to lure investment to their state. The WEF and its founder Klaus Schwab acknowledged some of this by renaming the conference “Cooperation in a Fragmented World”.

Still, those returning to Davos for the first time in three years may feel like the cocktail is a little less potent.

821,META,2023-03-07,Elizabeth Warren leads cavalry into deal battles,"













NEW YORK, March 7 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Reinforcements are arriving in the trustbusting fight. The U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday sued to block JetBlue Airways’ (JBLU.O) $3.8 billion acquisition of Spirit Airlines (SAVE.N), and it may yet be joined by colleagues at the Department of Transportation. It would be the third curious regulatory intervention in recent weeks, each encouraged by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren. The cases speak to how President Joe Biden’s administration is pushing its consolidation crackdown to new extremes.

DOT merger approval is typically a formality. Since the industry was deregulated in the late 1970s, the agency rarely, if ever, has declined to approve the transfer of certificates to operate routes from a seller to a buyer. It typically defers on a transaction’s merits to the DOJ, which handles antitrust investigations. In a September letter to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Warren argued that the DOT should use its own tools, specifically in the Spirit situation.

Airlines aren’t alone, either. The Federal Communications Commission dealt a blow to U.S. broadcaster Tegna’s (TGNA.N) $9 billion sale to hedge fund manager Standard General, while First Horizon’s (FHN.N) $13.5 billion takeover by Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) faces lengthy delays, including from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Warren leaned on both regulators to get involved.

The significance comes down to the courts. The DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission, its partner antitrust agency, have a mixed record of convincing judges to let them block deals. UnitedHealth (UNH.N) beat back a federal lawsuit against its plan to buy Change Healthcare; Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O) shrugged off an FTC attempt to stop its purchase of fitness app developer Within.

Companies are increasingly bracing for pushback. JetBlue says it built time for a lawsuit into the Spirit merger agreement. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE.N) on Tuesday renegotiated terms of its $12 billion deal to buy mortgage software developer Black Knight (BKI.N) to account for a divestiture designed to placate regulators, but it also vowed to litigate any FTC challenge.

Attacking deals from other flanks might sidestep some of the risk. Warren emphasized that the DOT’s edge is that it can block mergers “without having to go to court.” Speaking last month, she envisioned a host of agencies backstopping their antitrust brethren. As the senator charges up the competition cavalry, dealmakers may have to redraw their battle plans.

The U.S. Department of Justice on March 7 filed a lawsuit to block the $3.8 billion acquisition of budget carrier Spirit Airlines by JetBlue Airways. The Department of Transportation is also expected to block the deal by denying the transfer of Spirit’s airline operating certificate to JetBlue, according to a March 6 report by Bloomberg.

Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, on Sept. 15 sent a letter to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, requesting that the agency use its authority to scrutinize the merger, rather than deferring to the DOJ.

822,META,2022-04-05,Musk fully cashes in on Twitter hype,"













NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Twitter (TWTR.N) hasn’t wasted time. After Tesla (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk disclosed a 9% stake in the roughly $41 billion social media company on Monday, the firm appointed him to its board of directors. That’s defensible, as Musk has a solid record in running technology companies, and with over 80 million followers, it’s an insurance policy he won’t start his own platform. But Twitter’s value is up $10 billion since his stake was disclosed. His presence doesn’t validate such a big jump.

Musk and Twitter already have a longstanding relationship: He’s the eighth most popular user on the service, as measured by followers, according to Socialtracker, and he hasn’t been shy about how he uses read more the pulpit. He has fired off tweets about taking his company private and even questioned Twitter’s adherence to free speech principles. Users like him keep the viral nature of Twitter pumping.

In that sense, putting him on the board ensures he won’t follow former U.S. President Donald Trump by starting his own social media firm, as Musk has threatened to do. As chief executive of Tesla, he also brings experience in disrupting a massive industry. Against many detractors, Musk has turned Tesla into the leading electric vehicle company. Shares of the $1.2 trillion Tesla have returned nearly 1,800%, including dividends, in the past five years, versus about 40% at General Motors (GM.N) and 75% at Ford Motor (F.N).

How Musk’s experience translates into value for Twitter shareholders is another question. He has suggestions: Chief Executive Parag Agrawal retweeted Musk’s poll on Monday about Twitter adding editing capabilities. But Musk has plenty on his plate as Tesla’s CEO. Though Tesla was one of the first companies to popularize Twitter for disseminating corporate information, it’s hard to find large firms that aren’t aware of, and officially have been on, Twitter for years. Musk doesn’t have a history in Twitter’s other business, advertising.

Plus to justify the roughly 30% jump in valuation, Musk would have to bring some 65 million new followers onto the platform. That’s more than Twitter has following its own official account. Already at 6 times, Twitter's enterprise value-to-estimated sales is nearly 40% more than Facebook parent Meta Platforms (FB.O) according to Refinitiv. Musk has brought Twitter hype. But in less than 48 hours, he’s fully cashed in on it.

CONTEXT NEWS

- On April 4, Twitter appointed Elon Musk to the company’s board of directors. A Securities and Exchange filing earlier in the day said Musk, chief executive of Tesla, had acquired a 9.2% stake in the social network. The holding, through a personal trust, made him the social media company’s largest shareholder.

- Musk agreed not to increase his stake beyond 14.9% as long as he is a director, and 90 days after.

- Musk has previously criticized Twitter on its own platform. Last month, the Tesla CEO tweeted a poll asking whether the company “rigorously adheres” to the principle of free speech. He has also tweeted that he has considered creating an alternative platform. Both posts came after Musk built his stake, according to the SEC filing.

- Musk last month asked a federal judge to set aside a 2018 agreement with the SEC requiring that Tesla lawyers approve tweets and other public statements that could be material to the electric-car company which Musk is the CEO.

- Twitter’s stock rose 27% on April 4, and was up 3% in morning trading on April 5.

824,META,2022-08-15,Caste in California: Tech giants confront ancient Indian hierarchy,"[1/2] Guests arrive for at the Steve Jobs Theater for an Apple event at their headquarters in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 10, 2019. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo















OAKLAND, Calif, Aug 15 (Reuters) - America's tech giants are taking a modern-day crash course in India's ancient caste system, with Apple (AAPL.O) emerging as an early leader in policies to rid Silicon Valley of a rigid hierarchy that's segregated Indians for generations.

Apple, the world's biggest listed company, updated its general employee conduct policy about two years ago to explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of caste, which it added alongside existing categories such as race, religion, gender, age and ancestry.

The inclusion of the new category, which hasn't been previously reported, goes beyond U.S. discrimination laws, which do not explicitly ban casteism.

The update came after the tech sector - which counts India as its top source of skilled foreign workers - received a wake-up call in June 2020 when California's employment regulator sued Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) on behalf of a low-caste engineer who accused two higher-caste bosses of blocking his career.

Cisco, which denies wrongdoing, says an internal probe found no evidence of discrimination and that some of the allegations are baseless because caste is not a legally ""protected class"" in California. This month an appeals panel rejected the networking company's bid to push the case to private arbitration, meaning a public court case could come as early as next year. read more

The dispute - the first U.S. employment lawsuit about alleged casteism - has forced Big Tech to confront a millennia-old hierarchy where Indians' social position has been based on family lineage, from the top Brahmin ""priestly"" class to the Dalits, shunned as ""untouchables"" and consigned to menial labor.

Since the suit was filed, several activist and employee groups have begun seeking updated U.S. discrimination legislation - and have also called on tech companies to change their own policies to help fill the void and deter casteism.

Their efforts have produced patchy results, according to a Reuters review of policy across the U.S. industry, which employs hundreds of thousands of workers from India.

""I am not surprised that the policies would be inconsistent because that's almost what you would expect when the law is not clear,"" said Kevin Brown, a University of South Carolina law professor studying caste issues, citing uncertainty among executives over whether caste would ultimately make it into U.S. statutes.

""I could imagine that parts of ... (an) organization are saying this makes sense, and other parts are saying we don't think taking a stance makes sense.""

Apple's main internal policy on workplace conduct, which was seen by Reuters, added reference to caste in the equal employment opportunity and anti-harassment sections after September 2020.

Apple confirmed that it ""updated language a couple of years ago to reinforce that we prohibit discrimination or harassment based on caste."" It added that training provided to staff also explicitly mentions caste.

""Our teams assess our policies, training, processes and resources on an ongoing basis to ensure that they are comprehensive,"" it said. ""We have a diverse and global team, and are proud that our policies and actions reflect that.""

Elsewhere in tech, IBM told Reuters that it added caste, which was already in India-specific policies, to its global discrimination rules after the Cisco lawsuit was filed, though it declined to give a specific date or a rationale.

IBM's only training that mentions caste is for managers in India, the company added.

Several companies do not specifically reference caste in their main global policy, including Amazon (AMZN.O), Dell (DELL.N), Facebook owner Meta (META.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google (GOOGL.O). Reuters reviewed each of the policies, some of which are only published internally to employees.

The companies all told Reuters that they have zero tolerance for caste prejudice and, apart from Meta which did not elaborate, said such bias would fall under existing bans on discrimination by categories such as ancestry and national origin.

CASTEISM OUTLAWED IN INDIA

Caste discrimination was outlawed in India over 70 years ago, yet bias persists, according to several studies in recent years, including one that found Dalit people were underrepresented in higher-paying jobs. Debate over the hierarchy is contentious in India and abroad, with the issue intertwined with religion, and some people saying discrimination is now rare.

Government policies reserving seats for lower-caste students at top Indian universities have helped many land tech jobs in the West in recent years.

Reuters spoke to about two dozen Dalit tech workers in the United States who said discrimination had followed them overseas. They said that caste cues, including their last names, hometowns, diets or religious practices, had led to colleagues bypassing them in hiring, promotions and social activities.

Reuters could not independently verify the allegations of the workers, who all spoke on condition of anonymity, saying they feared harming their careers. Two said they had quit their jobs over what they viewed as casteism.

Some staff groups, including the Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) at Google's parent company, say explicit mention of caste in corporate rules would open the door to companies investing in areas such as data collection and training at the same levels as they do to protect other groups.

""Significant caste discrimination exists in the United States,"" said Mayuri Raja, a Google software engineer who is a member of the AWU and advocates for lower-caste colleagues.

Over 1,600 Google workers demanded the addition of caste to the main workplace code of conduct worldwide in a petition, seen by Reuters, which they emailed to CEO Sundar Pichai last month and resent last week after no response.

Google reiterated to Reuters that caste discrimination fell under national origin, ancestry and ethnic discrimination. It declined to elaborate further on its policies.

'NOT GOOD FOR BUSINESS'

Adding caste to a general code of conduct is not unheard of.

The World Wide Web Consortium, an industry standards body partly based in Massachusetts, introduced it in July 2020. California State University and the state Democratic Party have followed over the past two years.

In May this year, California's employment regulator, the Civil Rights Department, added caste to its example equal employment opportunity policy for employers.

Yet the move by Apple, a $2.8 trillion behemoth with more than 165,000 full-time employees globally, looms large.

The iPhone maker's fair hiring policy now states that Apple ""does not discriminate in recruiting, training, hiring, or promoting on the basis of"" 18 categories, including ""race, color, ancestry, national origin, caste, religion, creed, age"" plus disability, sexual orientation and gender identity.

By contrast, many employers are hesitant to go beyond laws with their primary policies, according to three employment attorneys including Koray Bulut, a partner at Goodwin Procter.

""Most companies simply quote from the federal and state statutes that list the protected categories,"" Bulut said.

Some companies have, however, gone further in secondary policies that govern limited operations or serve only as loose guidelines.

Caste is explicitly written into Dell's Global Social Media Policy, for example, and in Amazon sustainability team's Global Human Rights Principles and Google's code of conduct for suppliers.

Amazon and Dell confirmed they had also begun mentioning caste in anti-bias presentations for at least some new hires outside India. They declined to specify when, why and how broadly they made the addition, though Dell said it made the change after the Cisco lawsuit was filed.

The companies' presentations include explanations of caste as an unwanted social structure that exists in parts of the world, according to a Reuters review of some of the online training, with the Dell material referencing a recent lawsuit ""from the headlines.""

John-Paul Singh Deol, lead employment attorney at Dhillon Law Group in San Francisco, said that only including caste in training and guidelines amounted to ""giving lip service"" to the issue because their legal force is questionable.

This characterization was rejected by Janine Yancey, CEO of Emtrain, which sells anti-bias training to about 550 employers, and a longtime employment attorney.

""No company wants to have employee turnover, lack of productivity and conflict - that's just not good for business,"" she said.

Yet explicitly referencing caste would likely invite an increased number of HR complaints alleging it as a bias, Yancey added.

""Whenever you're going to call out something specifically, you're exponentially increasing your caseload,"" she said.

Apple declined to say whether any complaints had been brought under its caste provision.

South Carolina law professor Brown expects no immediate resolution to the debate over of whether companies should reference caste.

""This is an issue that ultimately will be resolved by the courts,"" he said. ""The area right now is unsettled.""

Summary Companies Snap Inc tumbles, profit fears hit rival social media cos

Abercrombie & Fitch slumps after lowering revenue outlook

Indexes: Dow up 0.15%, S&P down 0.81%, Nasdaq slides 2.35%















NEW YORK, May 24 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq finished in the red on Tuesday as worries that aggressive moves to curb decades-high inflation might tip the U.S. economy into recession dampened investors' risk appetite.

All three major U.S. stock indexes pared their losses in afternoon trading, with the blue-chip Dow turning positive. Even so, the S&P 500 ended just 2.2 percentage points above confirming it has been in a bear market since reaching its all-time high on Jan. 3.

""As we step back and acknowledge the primary market catalysts, it’s really been about the Fed pivot and the change in interest rates, which have influenced prices across the capital markets,"" said Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Helena, Montana.

""In the last two weeks, we’ve seen some degree of macroeconomic deterioration starting to be manifested in corporate earnings and economic releases.""

Much of the sell-off was driven by a profit warning from Snap Inc , which sent the company's shares plummeting 43.1%, sparking contagion throughout the social media segment.

Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Twitter Inc and Pinterest Inc were down between 5% and 24%, and the broader S&P 500 Communications Services sector (.SPLRCL) slid 3.7%.

Global supply chain disruptions have been exacerbated by Russia's war with Ukraine and restrictive measures in China to control its latest COVID-19 outbreak, sending inflation to multi-decade highs.

The U.S. Federal Reserve has vowed to aggressively tackle persistent price growth by hiking the cost of borrowing, and minutes from its most recent monetary policy meeting, expected on Wednesday, will be parsed by market participants for clues regarding the speed and extent of those actions.

Investors currently expect a series of 50-basis-point rate hikes over the next several months, fueling fears that the central bank could push the economy into recession, a scenario that is increasingly being baked into analyst projections.

Summary Companies U.S. service sector unexpectedly picks up in July

PayPal rises after raising profit outlook

Moderna jumps on $3 billion share buyback plan

Indexes: S&P 500 +1.56%, Nasdaq +2.59%, Dow +1.29%















Aug 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply higher on Wednesday, with strong profit forecasts from PayPal and CVS Health Corp lifting sentiment and helping elevate the Nasdaq to its highest level since early May.

Data showed the U.S. services industry unexpectedly picked up in July amid strong order growth, while supply bottlenecks and price pressures eased. That supported views that the economy was not in recession despite output slumping in the first half of the year. read more

A fresh batch of strong results from companies including PayPal (PYPL.O) and CVS Health Corp boosted sentiment in a largely upbeat quarterly reporting season. Reports exceeding low expectations have helped Wall Street rebound from losses caused by worries about decades-high inflation, rising interest rates and shrinking economic output.

""We're going through Q2 earnings and, by and large, from the tech complex to consumer discretionary and industrials, we're seeing a lot of better-than-feared prints, and that's just good enough right now,"" said Sahak Manuelian, managing director of trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.

Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) rallied almost 4%, while Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (META.O) jumped 5.4%.

PayPal soared almost 10% after it raised its annual profit guidance and said activist investor Elliott Management had an over $2 billion stake in the financial technology firm. read more

CVS Health gained 6.3% after the largest U.S. pharmacy chain raised its annual profit forecast after posting strong quarterly results. read more

Manuelian said an additional factor behind Wednesday's stock rally was growing confidence among investors that the Fed has already carried out the bulk of the interest rate hikes that will be necessary to bring inflation under control.

Meanwhile, Richmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin on Wednesday joined policymakers saying that the U.S. central bank is committed to getting inflation under control and returning it to its 2% target. read more

The S&P 500 climbed 1.56% to end the session at 4,155.12 points.

The Nasdaq gained 2.59% to 12,668.16 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.29% to 32,812.50 points.

Additional data on Wednesday showed new orders for U.S.-manufactured goods increased solidly in June and business spending on equipment was stronger than initially thought, pointing to underlying strength in manufacturing despite rising interest rates. read more

Wall Street's busiest trades

The most traded stock in the S&P 500 was Tesla , with $24.3 billion worth of shares exchanged during the session. Its shares rose 2.27%.

Of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes, 10 rose, led by information technology (.SPLRCT), up 2.69%, followed by a 2.52% gain in consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD).

The S&P 500 has rebounded about 13% from its closing low in mid-June and would have to climb another 15% to get back to its record high close in early January.

Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) surged about 16% after the vaccine maker announced a $3 billion share buyback plan. read more

Lifting of China's COVID lockdown helps factories recover















LONDON/TOKYO, July 1 (Reuters) - Global factory growth stalled in June as higher prices and a darker economic outlook left consumers wary of making purchases, while China's strict COVID-19 lockdowns and Russia's invasion of Ukraine added to supply chain disruptions, surveys showed.

They were the latest signs pointing to the risk of all-out recession in the global economy, coming after the world's top chipmakers said they were facing waning demand and as central bankers warned of painful interest rate hikes ahead.

""Between central banks digging their heels in to counter inflation and growing fears there is absolutely no path to a soft landing for the global economy, there are few, if any, places to hide,"" said Stephen Innes at SPI Asset Management.

In the euro zone, manufacturing output contracted for the first time since the pandemic's initial wave two years ago. S&P Global's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 52.1 in June from May's 54.6, its lowest level since August 2020.

Earlier, surveys showed China's factory activity recovering in June, though a slowdown in Japan and South Korea, as well as a contraction in Taiwan, highlighted the strain from supply disruptions, rising costs and persistent material shortages.

828,META,2022-10-21,Morning Bid: Tbond tension snaps sentiment,"













A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.

Politics may be painful, currencies restive and the earnings season full of pitfalls - but soaring U.S. Treasury borrowing rates cast the biggest pall over world markets running into the weekend.

U.S. Treasury yields from two to 30-years surged to new cycle highs on Friday as futures markets priced the Federal Reserve's peak 'terminal rate' next year at over 5% for the first time.

With the Fed entering a silent period from next week ahead of its November policy meeting, the hawkish message was unchanged from Philadelphia Fed chief Patrick Harker and he said the central bank was not done with raising rates amid very high levels of inflation. read more

But scale of the Treasury yield surge is being fed variously by concerns about liquidity in the market to the risk that Japan and China may soon sell some of their holdings as they sell dollars against the sliding yen and yuan, extreme moves fueled largely by rising U.S. yields.

Some banks blame the accelerated rundown of the Fed's balance sheet of bonds for the move and suspect this so-called 'quantitative tightening' may have to be slowed next year.

Japan's core consumer inflation rate accelerated to a fresh eight-year high of 3.0% in September, meantime, challenging the central bank's resolve to retain its ultra-easy policy stance as the yen's slump to 32-year lows continue to push up import costs. Dollar/yen surged close to 151 on Friday, up almost 32% over the past 12 months.

China's onshore yuan fell to another 14-year low despite major state-owned banks selling dollars on Friday.

Xi Jinping, poised to clinch a third five-year term as China's leader, will on Sunday preside over the most dramatic moment of the Communist Party's twice-a-decade congress and reveal the members of its elite Politburo Standing Committee. read more

Britain's pound also resumed its slide against the dollar and euro as a fresh political vacuum opened up following the resignation of Prime Minister Liz Truss on Thursday after just six weeks. The prospect of previously ousted Prime Minister Boris Johnson joining former finance minister Rishi Sunak in the race to succeed her did little to improve souring market sentiment. read more read more

The economic backdrop darkened. British shoppers reined in their spending more sharply than expected in September as they felt the hit from rising prices, and a one-off bank holiday to mark the funeral of Queen Elizabeth also weighed on retail sales figures for the month. Britain's borrowing also grew by more than expected. read more

After Tesla's disappointment earlier in the week, the U.S. earnings season took another negative twist from the digital sector overnight.

Shares of Snap (SNAP.N) dropped 27% in after-hours trading on Thursday after it forecast no revenue growth in the typically busy holiday quarter, sending other internet stocks such as Meta and Alphabet sliding for fear rising inflation could hurt all tech companies dependent on advertising revenue. read more

In banking, shares Credit Suisse slid again ahead of next week's big announcement on its restructuring plans. Investors have been adding to bets that shares still have further to fall after a social media storm forced a fresh look at the Swiss lender's problems. read more

A four-fold increase in the amount of the bank's stock borrowed by investors over the past two weeks reflects a spike in so called ""short selling"" or ""shorting"" of the shares.

Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Friday:

A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.

A frenetic weekend of political and policy action has injected significant two-way volatility into world markets, which are also now on high alert for signs the U.S. Federal Reserve may ease its foot off the interest rate brake.

Talk of a change of tack emerged late Friday amid reports the Fed was minded to reduce the size of its rate hikes after another 75 basis point rise next week, then pausing the tightening campaign some time next year.

The reports triggered a recoil in U.S. bond yields from their highest levels in over a decade, while futures pricing for a peak Fed 'terminal rate' of more than 5% next year fell back by more than 10bp to less than 4.90% on Monday.

But that was just the start of the gyrations across currencies, bonds and stocks everywhere.

A surge in Japan's ailing yen from 32-year lows later on Friday, amid reports of out-of-hours Bank of Japan intervention in New York, saw a peak-to-trough drop in dollar/yen of almost 4%. There were wild swings again on Monday amid suspicion of further BoJ sales, even though officials refused to confirm the action.

With the dollar back up above 149 on Monday, the scene is set for prolonged battle as the BoJ policy meeting this week is unlikely to veer from the ultra-loose monetary stance that's been undermining the currency as the Fed and others raise rates.

A weekend of political twists from Beijing to London only added to edgy market on Monday.

China leadership China's Xi Jinping secured a precedent-breaking third leadership term on Sunday and introduced a top governing body stacked with loyalists.

But the shape of the leadership team saw Hong Kong stocks slide 6% to 13-year lows and China's onshore yuan stumbled to its weakest level in 15 years, with Xi's picks heightening fears that economic growth will be sacrificed for ideology-driven policies.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index (.HSI) has now underperformed MSCI's broadest global stock index by almost 50% over two years.

Delayed Chinese economic releases did little to calm to markets, with better-than-forecast third-quarter growth and September industry numbers offset by disappointing retail and housing readouts. Oil prices also slipped down as the sweep of China data disappointed.

London then added to the volatile political picture on Sunday as weeks of turmoil within the UK government were given an added twist when former Prime Minister Boris Johnson pulled out of the race to succeed ousted Liz Truss.

Sterling and British bonds firmed amid relief the country may now avoid another divisive leadership battle and yet another potential U-turn on fiscal policy. Former finance minister Rishi Sunak is widely expected to be the new PM, with reports that standing finance minister Jeremy Hunt is set to quash even more tax relief plans to steady the country's finances.

But much like China's latest economic health check, European business survey readings for this month were another dark cloud for the world economy in general just as the European Central Bank is set to raise interest rates again this week.

Although European stocks were marginally higher on Monday, U.S. equity futures were in the red again - with mega-cap U.S. tech firms due to report third-quarter earnings over the next couple of days. Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Apple are all due.

Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Monday:

* Flash Oct business surveys from the United States, Europe and from around the world; Chicago Fed Sept National Activity Index

* U.S. corp earnings: Discover Financial Services, WR Berkley, Cadence Design Systems, Brown & Brown, Packaging Corp of America, Alexandria Real Estate Equities

* Bank of England Deputy governor for Markets and Banking Dave Ramsden speaks in London

* Bank of Spain governor Pablo Hernández de Cos speaks in Madrid

Summary

Summary Companies Markets see Fed, BoE and ECB rate-hike cycle end on horizon

Dollar bounces after biggest daily pct drop in a month

Meta scores biggest daily pct jump in nearly a decade















NEW YORK, Feb 2 (Reuters) - A gauge of global stocks climbed for a third straight day and longer-dated U.S. Treasury yields were flat on Thursday, as policy announcements from a host of central banks added to optimism that the cycles of interest rate hikes may be near an end.

After the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates by 25 basis points (bps) on Wednesday, as was widely expected, markets rallied following comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledging the ""disinflationary"" process may have begun.

The European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of England (BoE) hiked by 50 basis points each on Thursday, with the BoE signaling the tide was turning against inflation and the ECB indicating at least one more hike was on the horizon.

On Wall Street, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rallied, with the S&P 500 closing at its highest intraday level since Aug. 19 and the Nasdaq closing at its highest since Sept. 12, getting an additional boost from a 23.28% surge in Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), its biggest daily percentage jump since July 25, 2013, following its quarterly results and $40 billion buyback announcement. That helped the S&P communication services sector (.SPLRCL) jump 6.74%, its biggest daily percentage gain since March 13, 2020.

""The reaction to yesterday’s Fed comments really encouraged investors to go risk-on,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.

""The bottom line for investors, I think, is that the Fed’s comments were unexpected.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 39.02 points, or 0.11%, to 34,053.94 while the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 60.55 points, or 1.47%, to 4,179.76 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 384.50 points, or 3.25%, to 12,200.82.

On the economic front, weekly initial jobless claims dropped to a nine-month low, showing the labor market remains strong, while worker productivity in the fourth quarter accelerated. Investors will eye the January payrolls report on Friday for further signs of labor market strength.

With 46% of the S&P 500 having reported results, earnings for the quarter are expected to decline 2.4% from the year-ago period, according to Refinitiv data, compared with a 1.6% expected decline at the start of the year.

After the closing bell, Amazon shares lost 6.56% and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) dropped 6.09% after their quarterly results.

European stocks also jumped, with the STOXX 600 closing at its highest level since April 21 as it notched its biggest one-day percentage gain in a month.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index (.STOXX) rose 1.35% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (.MIWD00000PUS) gained 1.12%. The MSCI index hit its highest intraday level since May 5 and was on track for its ninth gain in the past ten sessions.

Benchmark 10-year notes were unchanged to 3.398%, reversing an earlier move lower.

The dollar bounced, however, from its biggest one-day percentage drop in nearly a month on Wednesday, while the euro and sterling weakened following the ECB and BoE announcements.

The dollar index rose 0.773%, with the euro down 0.73% to $1.0909.

The Japanese yen strengthened 0.21% versus the greenback at 128.67 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.2228, down 1.20% on the day.

In commodities, the dollar strength served to dent oil prices, with U.S. crude settling down 0.69% at $75.88 per barrel and Brent settled at $82.17, down 0.81% on the day.

831,META,2022-11-14,Fed may slow pace of rate hikes soon: Brainard,"[1/2] Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard testifies before a Senate Banking Committee hearing on her nomination to be vice-chair of the Federal Reserve, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., January 13, 2022. REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz/File Photo















Nov 14 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve will likely soon slow its interest rates hikes, Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard signaled on Monday, as the U.S. central bank tries to figure out how high borrowing costs need to go and how long they should stay there to bring down inflation.

""I think it will probably be appropriate soon to move to a slower pace of increases, but I think what’s really important to emphasize is... we have additional work to do,"" Brainard said in an interview with Bloomberg in Washington.

""It's really going to be an exercise on watching the data carefully and trying to assess how much restraint there is and how much additional restraint is going to be necessary, and sustained for how long, and those are the kinds of judgments that lie ahead for us,"" she said.

Brainard is the second ranking Fed official in as many days, along with Governor Christopher Waller on Sunday, to indicate the Fed is ready to begin moving in smaller rate hike increments as soon as its December meeting, while still emphasizing what Brainard called the central bank's ""resolve"" to keep pushing rates higher as needed to battle a surge of inflation.

The Fed raised its policy rate early this month to a range of 3.75%-4%, its fourth straight 75-basis-point interest-rate hike, as it seeks to rein in demand for goods, services, and labor so as to reduce inflation that's running more than three times the Fed's 2% target.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled that the central bank's next move may be smaller to give the Fed more scope to judge how the rapid rate hikes it has approved so far this year are affecting the economy, an impact that may only be apparent over many months.

But he also signaled the policy rate may next year peak at a rate higher than the 4.6% level that most policymakers had expected in September.

Brainard's remarks underscored that view.

""It makes sense to move to a more deliberate and a more data dependent pace as we continue to make sure that there's restraint that will bring inflation down over time,"" she said.

The Fed is balancing what it sees as a need to curb household and business spending and credit to try to lower inflation against the risk that if it tightens financial conditions too fast or too much it could trigger a more dramatic economic slowdown than needed, or even push the United States into recession.

Data released last week showing a slowdown in overall inflation and particularly in goods prices was ""reassuring,"" Brainard said, and so far many economic indicators have showed continued strength despite the Fed's aggressive rate increases, with hiring in particular still strong.

But Brainard, Waller and other officials agree they will need to see the pace of price changes continue to slow to become comfortable the Fed is getting control of the situation, noting that some key parts of the price index, such as rents, may not peak until ""well into next year.""

Yet there have been tremors, and perhaps most notably in potential layoffs in the tens of thousands coming at high-profile tech companies like Meta, Twitter and Amazon.

As the Fed's policy rate gets more restrictive, Brainard said, the balance of risks will become more ""two-sided,"" meaning that higher interest rates could start slowing the labor market enough to begin to endanger the Fed's second mandate of maximum employment.

Currently the U.S. unemployment rate is at 3.7%, below the 4% level that most policymakers believe reflects a long-run sustainable rate.

Recent labor market data suggests ""cooling,"" Brainard said, and lessening wage pressures.

""As we go forward...risks are going to be two sided if we get into more restrictive or further into restrictive territory,"" she said, ""so we'll be balancing those considerations.""

832,META,2022-12-28,"Inflation, recession and earnings among factors to drive U.S. stocks in 2023","













NEW YORK, Dec 28 (Reuters) - U.S. stock investors could not be more eager to turn the page on 2022, a brutal year dominated by market-punishing Federal Reserve rate hikes designed to tamp down the steepest inflation in 40 years.

The S&P 500 (.SPX) is down nearly 20% year-to-date with only a few trading days left in 2022, on pace for its biggest calendar-year drop since 2008. The carnage has been even more severe for the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC), which had tumbled by nearly 34% so far for the year.

High-profile casualties include the once-soaring shares of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), which have slumped around 50% this year, while those of Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) are down some 70% and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) shares have lost about 65%. Meanwhile, energy stocks (.SPNY) have bucked the trend by posting eye-popping gains.

S&P 500 timeline in 2022

Inflation, and the Fed's degree of aggressiveness in trying to contain it, will likely remain a critical factor driving equity performance as 2023 gets under way. But investors will also be watching for fallout from higher interest rates, including how tighter monetary policy ripples through the economy and whether it makes other assets more competitive with stocks.

Here is a look at some of the big themes for the U.S. stock market in 2023.

RECESSION OR SOFT LANDING?

Perhaps the biggest question that will sway stocks as the new year begins is whether the economy is headed for a recession, as many investors are expecting.

If a recession starts next year, stocks could be set for another slide: A bear market has never bottomed before the beginning of a recession, historic data showed.

Recessions tend to hit stocks hard, with the S&P 500 falling an average of 29% during recessions since World War Two, according to Truist Advisory Services. Those declines, however, have usually been followed by a strong rebound.

PROFITS AT RISK?

Investors are also concerned that corporate earnings estimates may not have fully factored in a potential slowdown, leaving more downside for stocks.

Consensus analyst estimates project S&P 500 earnings to rise 4.4% in 2023, according to Refinitiv IBES. Yet earnings fall by an average annual rate of 24% during recessions, according to Ned Davis Research.

GOODBYE, TINA?

The Fed’s rate hikes have pushed up bond yields and created competition for equities, flying in the face of the low-yield environment that predominated for more than a decade and gave rise to the acronym “TINA,” or “there is no alternative” to stocks.

Yields on the 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) - also known as real yields because they strip out projected inflation - recently stood at around 1.5%, after hitting their highest level in over a decade in October.

Still, some investors have noted that stocks fared well in past periods when yields were even higher.

CAN VALUE VAULT AHEAD?

In the past year, value stocks - commonly defined as those trading at a discount on metrics such as book value or price-to-earnings - held up better than tech and other growth shares, reversing trends that had been in place for much of the past decade.

With higher yields and doubts about profit growth standing to pressure tech and growth stocks, the question is whether value - which is more heavily represented by financial, energy and defensive groups - could be poised for another year of outperformance.

DOLLAR MAKING A DENT

The dollar’s surge against other currencies this year hurt the earnings of many U.S. companies, making it more expensive for multinationals to convert their earnings back into their home currency.

The greenback has pared some of those gains in recent weeks and a continued reversal would depend in part on investor perceptions of how hawkish the Fed will be relative to other global central banks.

NEW YORK, Dec 7 (Reuters) - (This Dec. 7 story has been corrected to replace ""more than 10%"" with ""in the red"" in paragraph 5.)

Investors who sell underperforming U.S. stocks to lock in tax benefits before year-end may be adding to recent pressure on equities while sowing the seeds of a January rebound in some corners of the market.

With the S&P 500 down about 16% year-to-date and many individual stocks nursing even sharper losses, tax-loss harvesting - or investors selling assets with a loss in order to cancel out the income taxes they owe on realized gains elsewhere in their portfolios - may be a stronger than usual headwind to markets this year.

Yet some investors are betting a number of those beaten-down stocks and possibly the broader market could snap back in January, once the selling period is over.

""This is the first time that investors are looking at double-digit declines in about 13 years, and we've never seen this level of tax-loss selling before,"" said Peter Essele, who oversees roughly $11 billion as in assets as head of portfolio management for Commonwealth Financial Network. ""That could result in a pretty strong first couple of months as people start reentering long-term assets.""

S&P 500 stocks that are down 10% or more for the year – making them likely targets for tax-loss selling – have historically outperformed the broader index by 8.2 percentage points between November and the end of January during years in which the index was in the red, analysts at BofA Global Research noted in a research report.

The firm identified 159 out of 338 stocks with a 10% or greater loss for the year in the S&P 500 that could bounce following tax selling, including Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Domino's Pizza Inc (DPZ.N), Home Depot Inc (HD.N), and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Shares of each company are down 1% or more for December, with Amazon leading the way with a roughly 8% decline.

DoubleLine founder Jeffrey Gundlach told CNBC on Wednesday that risk assets will likely rally in January once retail investors finish tax-loss selling. Strategists at Evercore wrote on Nov. 30 that they were ""buyers of stocks whose 2022 Tax Loss selling pressure will soon abate.""

Investors appear to have already started selling underperforming shares. Private clients at BofA, for instance, sold nearly $1.4 billion of stocks in likely tax-motivated selling in November, up from roughly $800 million last year, and appear poised to continue that outsized rate of selling this month, the firm said.

Vanda Research, which tracks the behavior of retail traders, wrote in a late-November research note that individual investors typically pull an average of approximately $1 billion on net from the shares of single U.S. stocks during the last weeks of December and put their funds into ETFs that give exposure to broader markets, helping fuel so-called ""Santa Claus rallies” at the end of the year.

Of course, macroeconomic concerns such as monetary policy and worries over a potential recession resulting from the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate hikes are likely to remain the main drivers of stock moves in 2023, potentially dwarfing the impact of seasonal flows, said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.

""We wouldn't want to overplay that trend as we move into more challenging waters next year,"" she said.

Feb 8 (Reuters) - Big Tech firms and Wall Street titans are leading a string of layoffs across corporate America as companies look to rein in costs to ride out a global economic downturn.

835,META,2022-12-19,Musk's poll results: Elon should step down as Twitter CEO,"













Dec 19 (Reuters) - Twitter users voted decisively in a poll for Elon Musk to step down as chief executive of the social media platform, a backlash against the billionaire less than two months after he took over in what has been a chaotic and controversial reign.

loading

Musk said on Sunday he would abide by the results of the poll, but did not give details on when he would step down if results said he should. He had said that there is no successor yet.

About 57.5% votes were for ""Yes"", while 42.5% were against the idea of Musk stepping down as the head of Twitter, according to the poll the billionaire launched on Sunday evening. Over 17.5 million people voted.

loading

""By Musk's - and some analysts' assertions – drastic measures are needed if Twitter's business model is to remain viable. There's an argument that without Musk at the helm, it's going to be difficult to find someone with enough gusto to change the course of Twitter's ship,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

The poll results capped a whirlwind week that included changes to Twitter's privacy policy and the suspension - and reinstatement - of journalists' accounts that drew condemnation from news organizations, advocacy groups and officials across Europe.

Then on Sunday, Twitter banned accounts that promoted rival social media platforms such as Facebook (META.O) in a now-deleted tweet, drawing questions even from long-time Musk supporters, including Twitter founder Jack Dorsey.

loading

Box CEO Aaron Levie called the policy ""just sad.""

loading

Since taking over in October, Musk swiftly fired top management and thousands of employees, seesawed on how much to charge for the social media firm's subscription service Twitter Blue, and reinstated accounts banned under the previous management, including that of former U.S. President Donald Trump.

On Sunday, Musk said he would put all Twitter policy changes to vote via public polls, provoking further questions on his management style and keen involvement in the social media firm, which has left some investors in Tesla (TSLA.O) anxious that he is distracted at a critical time for the electric automaker.

loading

Musk has been personally involved in working-level decisions from car styling to supply chain issues, and said last month he would reduce his time at Twitter, eventually finding a new leader to run it.

""Even Elon Musk's biggest detractors didn't imagine he would be making strategic decisions by his freshly-acquired social media platform in a Twitter poll but here we are,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.

""For someone who sets so much store by work ethic, Musk sure seems to spend a lot of time on social media. With Tesla shares having more than halved year-to-date, Musk needs to roll up his sleeves and get his main business back on the road.""

Tesla shares opened up about 2% on Monday, but later fell to fresh two-year low of $145.82. The stock has lost nearly 60% of its value this year.

'NO SUCCESSOR'

Replying to one Twitter user's comment on a possible change in CEO, Musk said on Sunday ""There is no successor.""

loading

""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.""

Musk, who was seen at the soccer World Cup final in Qatar on Sunday, has not yet responded to the results of Monday's poll. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Twitter is now running a poll on whether it should have a policy preventing accounts that advertise other social media platforms.

loading

The policy update would impact content from Meta Platforms' (META.O) Facebook and Instagram, along with Mastodon, Truth Social, Tribel, Nostr and Post. It would allow cross-content posting, Twitter support had said in the deleted tweet.

""This is the last straw. I give up. You can find a link to my new Mastodon profile on my site,"" said Musk ally and startup fund Y-Combinator founder Paul Graham. Mastodon is a social network that has been touted as a Twitter alternative.

loading

Twitter suspended Graham's account after his post, but later reinstated it.

April 27 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's criticism of Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) sparked a barrage of abusive tweets against the company's top lawyer on Wednesday, raising questions about his compliance with a non-disparagement agreement and the tone that the social media platform's incoming owner will set for its users.

Musk tweeted he disagreed with a decision Twitter made in 2020 to restrict the distribution of a New York Post article about U.S. President Joe Biden's son, Hunter. The billionaire, who has about 87 million Twitter followers, called the company's decision to lock the Post's account on the platform ""incredibly inappropriate.""

Musk, who on Monday reached a deal to acquire Twitter for $44 billion, was responding to a tweet by a podcast host Saagar Enjeti about Vijaya Gadde, the executive who oversees Twitter's policy and legal teams.

Enjeti described Gadde as ""the top censorship advocate at Twitter who famously gaslit the world on Joe Rogan's podcast and censored the Hunter Biden laptop story."" Gadde then became the subject of a wave of personal attacks by Twitter users on the platform.

Twitter's merger agreement with Musk stipulates that Musk can tweet about the deal while it is pending ""so long as such Tweets do not disparage the Company or any of its Representatives."" There was no indication that Twitter, which inked the deal with Musk after deciding his offer was attractive, would seek to cancel the sale because of his recent criticism.

Representatives for Musk and Twitter did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Gadde could not be reached for comment.

Dick Costolo, a former chief executive of Twitter, criticized Musk for the move. ""Bullying is not leadership.. What's going on? You're making an executive at the company you just bought the target of harassment and threats,"" Costolo tweeted.

Musk then tweeted back at Costolo: ""What are talking about? I'm just saying Twitter needs to be politically neutral.""

Musk also weighed in on a discussion about Twitter's deputy general counsel, Jim Baker. In response to critical comments made in a tweet by social media personality Mike Chernovich about Baker, Musk responded: ""Sounds pretty bad.""

Baker did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.

Katie Harbath, a former public policy director at Meta Platform Inc's Facebook (FB.O) who now leads consultancy Anchor Change, said Musk's criticism of Twitter's content moderation raises concerns that he could overrule recommendations from the team charged with setting policy and procedure.

A key question, Harbath said, is whether Musk is ""going to replace people inside of Twitter with people who go along with his viewpoints.""

Others worried that Twitter's efforts to deal with harassment, misogyny and misinformation might take a backward step under Musk.

""Musk's pursuit of his normal daily activities on Twitter exacerbate the worst aspects of the site and undercut the good work that folks at Twitter have been doing,"" said Adam Conner, vice president for technology policy at the Center for American Progress.

While Musk's activity on Twitter is attracting new scrutiny because of his deal on Monday to acquire the company, the world's richest person is no stranger to controversy and criticism on the platform.

Last October, Musk criticized Missy Cummings, a Duke University professor who was hired by the U.S. vehicle safety regulator as an advisor, in a tweet that was followed by personal attacks online on Cummings. A longtime critic of Tesla's driver assistant software, Cummings subsequently deleted her Twitter account.

In 2018, Musk called a British diver ""a pedo guy"" after he downplayed Musk's idea of using SpaceX's mini-submarine to rescue a boys' soccer team trapped in a cave in Thailand.

""If he proves incapable of tamping down the polarization, Twitter will slowly start to become less relevant because certain types of conversations will no longer be able to take place on it,"" said David A. Kirsch, an associate professor of management and entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland.

837,META,2022-12-18,Elon Musk launches poll asking if he should quit as Twitter CEO,"













Dec 19 (Reuters) - Twitter CEO Elon Musk launched a poll on the social media platform on Sunday asking users whether he should step down as head of the company, adding that he would abide by the poll results.

loading

As of 0952 GMT, more than 16 million users had participated in the poll, with 57.5% voting in favor of him stepping down one hour remaining before the poll closed on Monday.

The billionaire did not give details on when he would step down if the poll results said he should. Replying to one Twitter user's comment on a possible change in CEO, Musk said ""There is no successor"".

loading

Musk was in Qatar on Sunday to watch the World Cup final match between Argentina and France.

Musk had told a Delaware court last month that he would reduce his time at Twitter and eventually find a new leader to run the company.

""With the Twitter chaos front and center and resulting in a major headache and overhang for the Tesla story, we believe Musk needs to name a permanent CEO of Twitter (and not Musk himself) to end the pain,"" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.

The poll comes after Twitter's Sunday policy update, which prohibited accounts created solely for the purpose of promoting other social media firms and content that contains links or usernames for rival platforms.

Minutes before that poll, Musk apologised and tweeted ""Going forward, there will be a vote for major policy changes.""

loading

A few hours later, an official Twitter account started a separate poll asking users if the platform should have a policy preventing accounts that advertise other social media platforms on Twitter.

loading

The policy update would impact content from social media platforms like Meta Platforms' (META.O) Facebook and Instagram, along with Mastodon, Truth Social, Tribel, Nostr and Post while allowing cross-content posting, Twitter support said in a tweet.

Former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who recently invested in social media platform Nostr, replied to the Twitter support post with one word: ""Why?"". In a reply to another user posting about the Nostr promotion ban, Dorsey said, ""doesn’t make sense"".

loading

Short video-platform TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance Ltd, was not included in the list.

Last week, Twitter disbanded its Trust and Safety Council, a volunteer group formed in 2016 to advise the social media platform on site decisions.

CHOATIC ACTIONS

The policy change follows other chaotic actions at Twitter since Musk, who is also the CEO of Tesla (TSLA.O), bought the social network amid an exodus of advertisers. He fired top management and laid off about half of its workforce, while seesawing on how much to charge for subscription service Twitter Blue.

Shares in Tesla (TSLA.O) were up more than 4% in pre-market U.S. trade on Monday as investors closely watched the results of the poll.

The electric carmaker's shares have fallen almost 60% this year, with investors increasingly concerned about Musk being distracted and about the slowing global economy.

He has also cashed out nearly $40 billions of his Tesla shares over the past year, including big chunks of stock since buying Twitter in October.

""Given how much of a distraction Musk’s tenure at Twitter has become, shareholders in the electric vehicle manufacturer will be breathing a big sigh of relief if he steps back from Twitter and gets back to the day job at Tesla,"" said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.

Musk on Saturday reinstated the Twitter accounts of several journalists that were suspended for a day over a controversy on publishing public data about the billionaire' s plane.

His decision to lift that suspension followed the results of a Twitter poll he had issued, in which the majority of respondents voted for the journalists' accounts to be restored immediately.

The initial suspension of those accounts was heavily criticized by government officials, advocacy groups and several journalism organizations, with some saying Twitter was jeopardizing press freedom.

838,META,2022-06-06,Google ordered to pay Australian politician over defamatory YouTube videos,"













SYDNEY, June 6 (Reuters) - An Australian court on Monday ordered Google to pay a former lawmaker A$715,000 ($515,000), saying its refusal to remove a YouTuber's ""relentless, racist, vilificatory, abusive and defamatory"" videos drove him out of politics.

The Federal Court found the Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) company intentionally made money by hosting two videos on its YouTube website attacking the then-deputy premier of New South Wales, Australia's most populous state, that have been viewed nearly 800,000 times since being posted in 2020.

The ruling revives the question of how much culpability technology firms have for defamation conveyed by users on their websites in Australia, one of few Western nations where online platforms have the same legal responsibility as publishers.

Australia is reviewing what legal exposure platforms should have for defamatory posts. A landmark case in 2021, where a newspaper was found liable for defamatory reader comments below an article posted on Facebook, drove global firms to reduce their social media presence in the country. read more

The judgment showed Google had denied the videos carried defamatory imputations, and said the YouTuber had the right to an honestly held opinion and should be protected by the right to criticise a politician.

A Google spokesperson was not available for comment.

""They (Google) were advised that those defamatory videos were there, they looked into it, they decided for themselves that they weren't, and left them up,"" said Prof David Rolph, a specialist in media law at the University of Sydney Law School.

""That's an orthodox application of the basic principles of publication in defamation law (but) leaves the larger question about whether we need to reform the principles of publication.""

HATE SPEECH

The court heard that content creator Jordan Shanks uploaded videos in which he repeatedly brands lawmaker John Barilaro ""corrupt"" without citing credible evidence, and calls him names attacking his Italian heritage which the judge, Steve Rares, said amounted to ""nothing less than hate speech"".

[1/3] REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann 1 2 3

By continuing to publish the content, Rares said Google breached its own policies aimed at protecting public figures from being unfairly targeted, and ""drove Mr Barilaro prematurely from his chosen service in public life and traumatised him significantly.""

Barilaro quit politics a year after Shanks posted the videos, and ""Google cannot escape its liability for the substantial damage that Mr Shanks' campaign caused,"" Rares said.

Shanks, who has 625,000 YouTube subscribers and 346,000 followers on Meta Platforms Inc's (FB.O) Facebook, was a co-defendant until a settlement with Barilaro last year which involved the YouTuber editing the videos and paying the former politician A$100,000.

But Shanks ""needed YouTube to disseminate his poison (and) Google was willing to join Mr Shanks in doing so to earn revenue as part of its business model,"" the judge said.

Before the lawsuit was resolved, Shanks continued to make disparaging comments about Barilaro and his lawyers in YouTube videos, and the judge said he would refer him and Google to the authorities ""for what appear to be serious contempts of court by bringing improper pressure ... not to pursue this proceeding"".

In a Facebook post after the ruling, Shanks, who goes by the handle friendlyjordies, mocked Barilaro, saying ""you finally scored the coin from Google ... without ever having the truth tested in court"".

Shanks added, without evidence, that Barilaro ""withdrew (his) action against us so we wouldn't testify or present our evidence"" in support of the YouTuber's claims.

Barilaro told reporters outside the courthouse that he felt ""cleared and vindicated"".

""It was never about money,"" he said. ""It was about an apology, removal. Of course, now an apology is worthless after the campaign has continued. It's taken a court to force Google's hand.""

REUTERS/Stringer















NEW DELHI, June 17 (Reuters) - Authorities imposed restrictions on Friday on gatherings in a satellite city of India's capital that is home to offices of several multinational firms, and one person was killed as protests against a new military recruitment process spread.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government unveiled the new recruitment system this week, called Agnipath or ""path of fire"" in Hindi, triggering turmoil with police firing into the air to break up stone-throwing crowds and the torching of railway infrastructure.

The system aims to bring in more people to the military on short, four-year contracts to lower the average age of India's 1.38 million-strong armed forces and cut down on burgeoning pension costs. read more

But many potential recruits object, concerned about employment opportunities after serving their four-year terms and disappointed to miss out on a pension, and thousands of young men took to the streets on Friday, with protests turning violent in at least three states.

One protester was killed in a clash with police in the southern city of Secunderabad, a government official said.

The administration of Gurugram district, south of New Delhi, said no more than four people could gather at one place in an effort to forestall demonstrations.

""This order shall come into force with immediate effect,"" Gurugram's administration said in a notice, a copy of which was posted on social media by district's information department.

While there have been no reports of protests in Gurugram, some demonstrators were out in the neighbouring district of Palwal on Thursday.

Some of the world's major companies have offices in Gurugram including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Meta and Google Inc. (GOOGL.O). it is also home to manufacturing facilities of major Indian companies like Maruti Suzuki (MRTI.NS).

The new recruitment system has drawn criticism from opposition parties, and even from some members of Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, who say it will lead to more unemployment in a country grappling with joblessness. read more

The government has said the armed forces aim to recruit about 46,000 people under the new system this year, and will keep only 25% of them on at the end of their four-year terms.

'NO PENSION'

In the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, protests erupted in 14 districts, and police fired into the air to push back stone-throwing crowds, senior police official Prashant Kumar said.

""The police are trying to disperse protesters by holding talks with them,"" Kumar told Reuters.

Avnish Kumar, a 19-year-old from Uttar Pradesh's Ballia district who hoped to join the army, said he was disappointed with the new scheme.

""The tenure of the job is only four years and only 25% people will get job after that,"" he told Reuters by telephone. ""There is no pension.""

In neighbouring Bihar state, protesters torched train coaches in at least two stations and disrupted rail services, police said.

Hundreds of people gathered in Secunderabad in the south, clashing with police and setting fire to railway station property, police said.

The new process will bring in men and women between the ages of 17-and-a-half and 21 for a four-year tenure at non-officer ranks, with only a quarter retained for longer.

Soldiers have previously been recruited by the army, navy and air force separately, and typically serve for up to 17 years, for the lowest ranks.

The government on Friday also announced a one-time extension for the maximum entry age into the scheme to 23 since recruitment had been frozen for the past two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

840,META,2022-04-18,Breakingviews: Twitter’s habitat lacks natural predators,"













NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The best buyer for Twitter (TWTR.N) may be nobody. The social network on Friday enacted a “poison pill” read more , temporarily blocking Elon Musk’s $41 billion takeover bid, but putting it in play. As Twitter learned in 2016 when multiple suitors walked away, closing a deal can be harder.

Musk’s offer of $54.20 per share, which is non-binding and lacks financing, is easy for Twitter to dismiss. It also shows the steep financial hill buyers will have to climb. The Tesla (TSLA.O) boss would earn an unattractive return of about 1% on his investment by 2024, according to a Breakingviews analysis read more using estimates compiled by Refinitiv. Reducing the board’s salaries to zero, as Musk claimed in a tweet on Monday, barely changes that calculation. Besides, the board would probably demand a higher premium before recommending a deal.

Twitter’s meager cash flow makes it hard for financial buyers like Thoma Bravo to finance a takeover with lots of debt. Private equity investors could join forces with Musk, who owns more than 9% of the company. But that would mean playing junior partner to the entrepreneur, whose ideas for Twitter appear to include upending its advertising business.

Microsoft (MSFT.O), Meta Platforms (FB.O) or Alphabet (GOOGL.O) might see an opportunity to squeeze more advertising revenue out of Twitter’s community of devoted users. But regulators in America and Europe read more have made it clear they will oppose any deals that make technology giants even more powerful.

Salesforce.com (CRM.N) wanted to buy Twitter in 2016, when the social network was roughly half its current size, but abandoned the effort after its stock fell on the news. Shareholders in the $188 billion software group are unlikely to be more receptive now. Brand-conscious buyers, meanwhile, will be wary. Former Walt Disney (DIS.N) CEO Bob Iger said he walked away in 2016 because of the “nastiness” on Twitter’s platform. Attempts to reduce negativity and disinformation may please advertisers but put off users like Musk, who worry it restricts free speech.

Musk’s interest shows that a lack of obvious financial logic may not prevent a deal. A more likely outcome, however, might be a partial investment, perhaps by a private equity firm. Silver Lake in 2020 invested $1 billion in Twitter through a convertible note, helping to finance a share buyback to get activist Elliott Management onside. The company could use a similar deal to buy Musk out of his stake. It would be a reminder that Twitter’s habitat lacks natural predators.

Defense stocks gain as Russia-Ukraine turmoil continues

Indexes down: Dow 0.58%, S&P 0.04%, Nasdaq 0.40%















NEW YORK, March 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street closed lower on Monday, with stocks extending their slide after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hinted at a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy than previously anticipated, adding to uncertainties regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

While all three major U.S. stock indexes ended well off session lows, they snapped four-session winning streaks on the heels of their biggest weekly percentage gains since early November 2020.

The central bank must move ""expeditiously"" to combat inflation, Powell told the National Association for Business Economics conference, adding that bigger-than-usual interest rate hikes could be deployed if needed. read more

""Much of the news today was telegraphed last week in (Powell's) comments,"" said Matthew Keator, managing partner in the Keator Group, a wealth management firm in Lenox, Massachusetts. ""The difference is there was some question regarding whether a 50 basis-point rate hike might be a course of action sooner rather than later.""

Fed funds futures now imply a 60.7% chance of a 50 basis-point hike in key interest rates at the Fed's next meeting in May, up from 52% before the text of Powell's speech was released.

""Some Fed governors have been vocal about front-end loading some of those hikes, putting them on the books sooner rather than later,"" Keator added. ""But I don't think the markets should anticipate a series of 50 basis-point rate hikes between now and the end of the year.""

Fighting raged on in Ukraine as efforts to negotiate an end to the conflict appeared to be making little progress. read more

Crude prices continued to surge as the European Union weighed joining the United States in banning Russian oil , which raised supply concerns and helped put energy shares (.SPNY) out front.

842,META,2022-04-27,Mixed earnings from U.S. tech giants may do little to assuage worried investors,"













NEW YORK, April 27 (Reuters) - A mixed bag of earnings from some of Wall Street’s biggest companies may muddy the outlook for investors hoping to ""buy the dip"" amid a vicious stock market selloff.

With a massive week of corporate results under way, Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) reported first-quarter revenue below expectations on Tuesday, while software giant Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) forecast double-digit revenue growth for its next fiscal year. read more

Investors have focused on results from some of Wall Street’s biggest names this week, hoping they could provide a counterweight to the deluge of news that has battered stocks in recent days, highlighted by concerns over an increasingly hawkish Federal Reserve to worries over geopolitical turbulence stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. read more

Though most of the earnings season lies ahead, some investors worry that anything less than stellar results from corporate behemoths will do little to stem a slide in stocks that left the S&P 500 down 12.4% on the year after Tuesday’s 2.8% drop. The Nasdaq on Tuesday hit its lowest closing level since December 2020 as it lost nearly 4%, bringing it 22% below the all-time high it hit less than six months ago, on Nov. 19. read more

S&P 500 futures pared earlier gains on Wednesday morning and were recently up around 0.3%.

""There's a lot of anxiety ahead of the earnings ... because if they don't hold up, then there's nothing left to hold up the market,"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital in New York.

Despite the mixed results from big growth names, earnings in the broad S&P 500 have topped analyst expectations. Overall, about 81% of companies have exceeded earnings expectations, with first-quarter profits now expected to have climbed 8.2% from the year-ago period, up from an estimated 6.4% at the start of April, according to Refinitiv data as of Tuesday morning.

Yet there have been some high-profile disappointments, including growth-stock poster child Netflix (NFLX.O), whose shares were pummeled after its results.

“Expectations for growth (companies) are very, very high, and you don’t meet expectations and you are going to see the Netflix or the Google drops,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago. “It's not industry specific, it’s more company specific.”

Microsoft’s shares were up about 3.5% in pre-market trading on Wednesday, while Alphabet’s were off about 4.6%.

In another setback for growth stocks, Tesla (TSLA.O) shares tumbled 12% on Tuesday after the electric carmaker's CEO, Elon Musk, clinched his deal to buy Twitter (TWTR.N) for $44 billion.

But on the upbeat side, shares of Visa (V.N) rose in after-hours trade on Tuesday after the payments company said it expects revenue to accelerate past pre-pandemic levels. read more

Markets could get fresh jolts this week as other results flow in, including from Apple (AAPL.O)and Amazon.com (AMZN.O). Facebook owner Meta Platforms is scheduled to report after the close on Wednesday (FB.O).

With only a few days left in the month, the S&P 500 is down 7.8% for April so far, which would be its biggest monthly percentage drop since March 2020.

Even so, there may be some reason for optimism in April's final days. According to Bespoke Investment Group, in 39 prior months since 1980 where the S&P 500 was down at least 5% with three trading days left, the S&P averaged a gain of 1.51% in the final three trading days of these months.

""Usually, the final three trading days of these bad months offer up some relief for investors,"" Bespoke said in a note.

843,META,2022-11-16,"Amazon lays off some devices unit staff as it targets 10,000 cuts","













Nov 16 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) on Wednesday said it has laid off some employees in its devices group as a person familiar with the company said it still targeted around 10,000 job cuts, including in its retail division and human resources.

The announcement, Amazon's first since media outlets including Reuters reported its layoff plans on Monday, heralded a dramatic shift for a company known for its job creation and added shape to the latest dismissals befalling the technology sector.

Amazon executive Dave Limp in a blog post said the company had decided to consolidate teams in its devices unit, which popularized speakers that consumers command through speech. It notified the employees it cut on Tuesday.

""We continue to face an unusual and uncertain macroeconomic environment,"" he said. ""In light of this, we've been working over the last few months to further prioritize what matters most to our customers and the business.""

Plans, still in flux, to eliminate around 10,000 roles through reductions in more units would amount to about a 3% cut in Amazon's roughly 300,000-person corporate workforce. The company has offered voluntary buyouts to some human-resources staff, the source familiar with Amazon's job-cut plans said.

For years, the online retailer aimed to make Alexa, the voice assistant that powers gadgets it sells, ubiquitous and present to place any shopping order, even though it was unclear how widely users have embraced it for more complex tasks than checking the news or weather.

A project inspired by a talking computer in science fiction show Star Trek, Alexa had garnered headcount that grew to 10,000 people by 2019.

At the time, Amazon touted sales of more than 100 million Alexa devices, a figure it has not since refreshed publicly. Founder Jeff Bezos later said the company often sold Alexa devices at a discount and sometimes below cost.

While Amazon has toiled to encode intelligent answers to any question Alexa might expect from users, Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)-backed OpenAI have had breakthroughs in chatbots that could respond like a human without any hand holding.

Dozens of individuals posted on the professional networking site LinkedIn to say Amazon had laid them off, among them people who claimed to work on privacy for Alexa and software for the company's cloud gaming service Luna.

Following the layoff news, shares pared losses and closed down about 2%.

ABOUT-FACE

The news follows Facebook's parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) announcement last week to eliminate 11,000 jobs, on top of layoffs at Twitter Inc, Microsoft, Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and others.

For Amazon, the cuts sharply contrast with efforts months ago to double its base pay ceiling to compete more aggressively for talent.

In September last year it had marketed 55,000 corporate roles globally during a career fair, an increase dwarfed only by hiring in Amazon's fulfillment centers. In short order, the online bookseller that Bezos envisioned on a road trip not 30 years before had become America's second-largest private employer, with more than 1.5 million workers including warehouse staff.

The turn has been abrupt. The retailer is now responding to sales that could rise as little as 2% this holiday season, compared with a 38% increase two years ago. Amazon's chief financial officer told reporters last month that consumers had tighter budgets in the face of inflation and higher fuel costs.

Its cloud-computing division, a profit engine for the company, likewise has increased revenue more slowly quarter after quarter in the past year, when adjusted for foreign exchange.

Andy Jassy, who ascended to the role of CEO in 2021, has focused on cutting costs and stemming Amazon's 43% share-price drop this year to date.

Under his tenure Amazon announced the end of its virtual healthcare service for employers and pruning of its much-hyped autonomous sidewalk delivery program. It froze incremental corporate hiring as well.

REUTERS/Jim Bourg/File Photo















NEW YORK, June 27 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The demolition of the constitutionally protected right to an abortion in the United States is historic. But for companies doing business in America, the cost-benefit analysis it provokes will feel familiar. Corporate bosses will end up viewing America’s illiberal states the way they do any emerging market.

Each state will be left to decide how and whether to regulate abortion after the Supreme Court on Friday decided that protections of “life, liberty, or property” don’t include ending a pregnancy as a right. At least eight states had already banned the procedure by Monday, and around half of the 50 are primed to outlaw it under statutes already in place.

Removing access to abortion could increase maternal deaths by over one-fifth, according to Duke University, and Black maternal deaths by one-third. Recognizing the anxiety, companies have moved to reassure their staff: Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) are among those offering to fund travel costs for employees who need to go out of state for healthcare and reproductive services.

But if the majority of Americans who oppose the overturning of Roe vs. Wade hope their large, powerful employers will do more, they will be disappointed. Multinationals long ago made peace with setting up shop in locations where freedoms taken for granted in some countries are limited in the name of stability or ideology. Foreign direct investment into China surged by a third to $344 billion last year, according to Peterson Institute for International Economics. Net foreign investment in Saudi Arabia jumped more than threefold in 2021, according to state media.

China and states like Texas are in that way somewhat similar. The Lone Star state offers low taxes, good universities, rich natural resources, and scale. Accepting bans on abortion is simply the cost of doing business for companies like Goldman Sachs and Apple (AAPL.O). So is turning a blind eye to the governing Texas Republican Party’s recent declaration that “homosexuality” is “an abnormal lifestyle choice,” an awkward reality for companies that trumpet their commitment to diversity.

Emerging-market attitudes don’t always create economic success for nations – or states. Mississippi, for example, has no Fortune 500 companies headquartered within its borders. It’s also the state with the least well-functioning healthcare system in the country, according to the Commonwealth Fund. Even then, there’s a price at which growth looks attractive. JPMorgan (JPM.N) opened its first branch in the Magnolia State last year.

When asked how they feel about draconian governments in profitable places, company bosses often say that they follow the laws wherever they operate, and it’s not their job to challenge what those laws are. Investors mostly acquiesce. America is now another place for them to practice that line.

CONTEXT NEWS

Several U.S. states had moved to ban abortion within days of the Supreme Court overturning a landmark ruling that had affirmed abortion as a constitutionally protected right.

Thirteen of the 50 states already had so-called trigger laws designed to be enacted as soon as the Roe vs. Wade decision of 1973 had been struck down. Some ban abortions completely, while others outlaw them after a certain number of weeks.

Nine states, including Texas, Missouri, South Dakota and Oklahoma, were classed by the Guttmacher Institute as having “most restrictive” policies in effect as of June 27. Eleven, including New York, California, Oregon and Illinois, were labeled “protective” or “most protective.”

Sept 29 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply lower on Thursday on worries that the Federal Reserve's aggressive fight against inflation could hobble the U.S. economy, and as investors fretted about a rout in global currency and debt markets.

With tech heavyweights Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) slumping more than 4%, the Nasdaq sank to near its lowest level of 2022, set in mid-June.

The S&P 500 (.SPX) touched lows last seen in November 2020. Down more than 8% in September, the benchmark is on track for its worst September since 2008.

A sell-off in U.S. Treasuries resumed as Fed officials gave no indication the U.S. central bank would moderate or change its plans to aggressively raise interest rates to bring down high inflation.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said she does not see distress in U.S. financial markets that would alter the central bank's campaign to lower inflation through rate hikes that have taken the Fed funds rate to a range of 3.0% to 3.25%. read more

Data showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to a five-month low last week as the labor market remains resilient despite the Fed's aggressive interest rate hikes.

846,META,2022-06-15,Explainer: What is a bear market?,"













NEW YORK/OAKLAND, June 15 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 index, the most closely followed benchmark for U.S. equities on Wall Street, has slid this year as inflation jumped to its highest rate in 40-years.

On Monday, a steep selloff triggered by fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its meeting on Wednesday above prior expectations left the S&P 500 down more than 20% from its record high in January, confirming in the vernacular of many on Wall Street that it is in a bear market. read more

But what does that term mean?

WHAT IS A BULL AND A BEAR MARKET?

On Wall Street, the terms ""bull"" or ""bear"" markets are often used to characterize broad upward or downward trends in asset prices. But not all analysts define bull or bear markets the same way, and some investors use the terms loosely.

S&P Dow Jones Indices defines a bull market in the S&P 500 as a 20% rise from its previous low. It ends at the final peak before a subsequent decline of 20%.

It defines a bear market as a decline of at least 20% in the S&P 500 from its previous peak. It ends when the index reaches its low before then going on to set a new high. S&P uses closing prices for its calculations.

Bull markets in both stocks and bonds are far more common than bear markets. While the S&P 500 has notched 12 bear markets since 1948, some bull markets have lasted 10 years or longer. U.S. bonds, meanwhile, were in a 40-year long bull market that some analysts say has only recently ended.

HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SWITCH FROM ONE TO THE OTHER?

Bull markets in stocks typically coincide with an expanding economy or a rebound after a short-term slump.

Bear markets, meanwhile, often lead into a recession and last until investors think that the worst of the economic downturn is behind them. Nine of the 12 bear markets since 1948 have been accompanied by recessions, according to investment research firm CFRA. read more

HOW LONG DO BEAR MARKETS LAST?

According to CFRA, S&P 500 bear markets since 1946 have taken an average of 389 calendar days to bottom, and then another two years to return to their prior high.

But there is a broad range. The last bear market in early 2020 took only 33 days to bottom, while the dot-com bubble bear market 20 years ago required 929 days to bottom, according to CFRA.

WHAT ARE THE DEFINING FEATURES OF THIS ONE?

Previously highly valued growth stocks have been badly punished in recent months by investors worried that rising interest rates will force consumers to tighten their belts.

Within the S&P 500 technology sector index (.SPLRCT), 91% of stocks were currently down 20% or more from their highs as of Tuesday, including PayPal Holdings (PYPL.O), which has now tumbled 77% from its record high last July.

Among stocks in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary index , down 68% from its high.

Within the communication services sector index (.SPLRCL), Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (META.O) has slumped 57% from its 2021 high, and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) has fallen 50%.

The stock market's recent tumble has cooled valuations that in 2020 reached their highest level since the dot-com era. The S&P 500 is now priced at about 17 times expected earnings, which is in line with its average forward PE over the past 10 years, according to Refinitiv data.

Nov 28 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended sharply lower on Monday after protests in major Chinese cities against strict COVID-19 policies sparked concerns about economic growth, while Apple Inc (AAPL.O) slid on worries about a hit to iPhone production.

Shares of the Cupertino, California tech giant lost 2.6% and weighed heavily on the benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX) index as worker unrest at the world's biggest iPhone factory in China fanned fears of a deeper hit to the already constrained production of higher-end phones.

Rare protests in major Chinese cities over the weekend against the country's strict zero-COVID curbs are exacerbating worries about growth in the world's second-largest economy.

""These protests are just evidence that this is a kind of a moving target where, will China continue to try to really constrain COVID's spread?"" said Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.

""Or will they have more of a 'living with COVID' approach that we've seen in the United States and other countries?""

""We think COVID itself and China's policy is one of the key variables for 2023 that would influence stock prices and investors,"" Hainlin said.

S&P 500 stocks

All 11 S&P 500 sector indexes declined, led by real estate (.SPLRCR), down 2.81%, and a 2.74% loss in energy (.SPNY).

U.S. shares of Pinduoduo Inc (PDD.O) surged 12.6% after the Chinese e-commerce platform beat estimates for third-quarter revenue, helped by COVID-related lockdowns in the country that forced consumers to shop online. U.S. shares of other Chinese technology companies also rose, with Baidu (9888.HK) and Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) each gaining over 2%.

The S&P 500 declined 1.54% to end the session at 3,963.95 points.

With two trading days left in November, the S&P 500 is on track for a gain of 2.4% for the month.

Shares of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) rose 0.6% after an industry report estimated spending during Cyber Monday, the biggest U.S. online shopping day, would rise to as much as $11.6 billion.

Trading was mixed in other heavyweight growth stocks, including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O).

Biogen Inc (BIIB.O) fell following a report of death during a clinical study of its experimental Alzheimer's drug.

Shares of cryptocurrency and blockchain-related companies Coinbase Global Inc (COIN.O), Riot Blockchain Inc (RIOT.O) and Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (MARA.O) each fell about 4% following lender BlockFi's bankruptcy filing, the latest casualty since FTX's collapse earlier this month.

This week, investors will keep a close watch on November U.S. consumer confidence data, due on Tuesday; the government's second estimate for third-quarter gross domestic product, due on Wednesday; and November nonfarm payrolls due on Friday.

Declining stocks outnumbered rising ones within the S&P 500 (.AD.SPX) by a 12.2-to-one ratio.

The S&P 500 posted 12 new highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 93 new highs and 174 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was relatively light, with 9.3 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 11.3 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.

Summary Companies PCE: inflation cools along with consumer spending

American Express, Visa climb higher on solid demand

Chevron falls after missing profit estimates

Indexes up: Dow 0.08%, S&P 0.25%, Nasdaq 0.95%















NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Wall Street advanced on Friday, marking the end of an rocky week in which economic data and corporate earnings guidance hinted at softening demand but also economic resiliency ahead of next week's Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting.

All three major U.S. stock indexes ended the session green, with the Nasdaq, powered by megacap momentum stocks, enjoying the biggest gain.

From last Friday's close, the S&P and the Dow posted their third weekly gains in four, while the tech-laden Nasdaq notched its fourth straight weekly advance.

So far in the early weeks of 2023, the Nasdaq has jumped 11%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow have gained 6% and 2.5%, respectively.

""It's a nice end to another solid week of what's shaping up to be a historically strong month,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group in Omaha. ""It's a realization that inflation continues to come down quickly and that is alleviating a lot of worries regarding the economy.""

The Commerce Department's hotly anticipated personal consumption expenditures (PCE) report arrived largely in line with consensus, showing softening demand and cooling inflation - which is exactly what the Federal Reserve's restrictive interest rate hikes are intended to accomplish.

""(The PCE report) is another building block to the inflation data we’ve been seeing recently,"" Detrick added. ""Supply chains continue to open up and improve, opening the door for the Fed to end its aggressive rate hiking cycle.""

Fed Chair Jerome Powell has clearly stated that the central bank's battle against decades-high inflation is far from over, however. Financial markets still believe the central bank will hike the Fed funds target rate by another 25 basis points at the conclusion of next week's policy meeting.

Fourth-quarter earnings season is running on all cylinders, with 143 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 67.8% have beaten Street expectations, slightly better than the 66% long-term average, but well below the 76% beat rate over the past four quarters, according to Refinitiv.

Analysts now see aggregate S&P 500 earnings falling 2.9% year-on-year, compared with the milder 1.6% annual drop seen on Jan. 1, per Refinitiv.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 28.67 points, or 0.08%, to 33,978.08, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 10.13 points, or 0.25%, to 4,070.56 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 109.30 points, or 0.95%, to 11,621.71.

Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) led the percentage gainers, while energy (.SPNY) suffered the largest percentage loss, down 2%.

Shares of Intel Corp (INTC.O) plunged 6.4% after the chipmaker provided dismal earnings projections.

Chevron Corp (CVX.N) posted record 2022 profit, but its fourth quarter earnings fell short of expectations, dragging the stock down 4.4%.

Rival payment companies American Express Co (AXP.N) and Visa Inc (V.N) reported consensus-beating results, easing worries of waning consumer demand. There shares jumped 10.5% and 3.0%, respectively.

Next week, in addition to the Fed meeting and January employment data, a string of high profile earnings reports are on tap, notably from Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O), among others.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.34-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 94 new highs and 32 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.88 billion shares, compared with the 11.10 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

849,META,2023-01-24,Explainer: Wall Street's market glitches and the repercussions,"













NEW YORK, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) suffered a technical problem at the opening of trading on Tuesday that caused more than 80 stocks to be halted for several minutes, creating confusion among traders about which orders were filled and where stocks were trading, and harking back to the ""flash crash"" of 2010.

WHAT WAS THE ""FLASH CRASH"" OF 2010?

On May 6, 2010 when equities were recovering from the financial crisis and in the early stages of what would become a near-eleven year bull market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell almost 700 points in mere minutes, briefly erasing an estimated $1 trillion in market capitalization.

This led some market participants to voice complaints that increasingly automated trading posed a systemic risk. Others saw such a shocking market tumble as an outlier, and the cost of progress, that just needed additional guardrails in order to avoid a repeat. Nevertheless, it drew comparisons to the October 1987 Wall Street collapse.

WHAT WAS THE RESPONSE TO THE 1987 CRASH?

After the ""Black Monday"" crash in 1987, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mandated the creation of market-wide ""circuit breakers"" that required a temporary halt to trading for every 10% decline in the Dow, in what can be seen as a precursor to later rules. In 2012, the benchmark index for the circuit breakers changed to the S&P 500 (.SPX) and the percentage levels needed to trigger the trading halt were lowered.

Unlike the Black Monday crash, the 'flash crash', was largely seen as something that could have been prevented with more intervention and the SEC quickly responded with some small fixes, along with a promise to investigate concerns about the increasingly complicated and fragmented stock market. In addition, a special committee of experts made recommendations on how to prevent another crash.

One of the measures adopted in 2011 was for single-stock circuit breakers, a 5-minute trading halt in any stock or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that moved more than 10% in less than 5 minutes. That rule was replaced in 2012 by the ""Limit-Up Limit-Down"" regulation, which pauses trading in a stock if it trades outside of a specific range based on a rolling price.

Meanwhile in 2014, the SEC adopted a set of rules called regulation system compliance and integrity (Reg SCI) to hold exchanges accountable for such interruptions to trading.

The bands ""Limit Up Limit Down"" were adjusted after a trading session in August 2015 that saw more than 1,250 trading halts in 455 individual stocks and ETFs.

HAVE THERE BEEN OTHER GLITCHES SINCE 2010?

There have been instances, of varying severity, since the 2010 crash where trading was unable to take place. A memorable interruption was the delayed debut of Meta Platforms (META.O), what was then Facebook, in its initial public offering. Others included a three-hour trading halt on Aug. 22, 2013 and the Aug 2015 session that saw trading halted for nearly four hours. The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE.Z) saw two outages within a week in 2013. But until Tuesday's technical problem, major outages have been largely contained in recent years. Notable exceptions affected individual investors more than large institutions, such as the 2020 glitches that affected trading on retail brokerages Robinhood Markets (HOOD.O) and Interactive Brokers Group (IBKR.O).

WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

The NYSE said a ""system issue"" prevented Tuesday's opening auctions in a subset of 251 stocks, causing them to begin trading without an opening price, resulting in a host of trades the exchange later ""busted"", exchange terminology for nullified. Investors and traders that suffered losses can file a claim for reimbursement under the NYSE's ""Rule 18"" although it was unclear how any monetary settlement would be determined. In addition, the SEC staff was still reviewing activity related to the trade halts, according to an agency spokesperson.

850,META,2023-02-26,EU says not taking sides as Big Tech 'fair share' debate dominates mobile meet,"Summary

Summary Companies EU's Breton says not prioritising telecoms' interests

Dutch govt first to criticise plan to charge tech firms

Big Tech oppose the EU proposals

Event to showcase new product launches















BARCELONA, Feb 27 (Reuters) - EU industry chief Thierry Breton on Monday said he was not taking sides in a clash between Big Tech and European telecoms operators over who should fund the rollout of 5G and broadband as the world's largest telecoms conference opened in Barcelona.

Speaking at the Mobile World Congress (MWC), Breton defended a 12-week consultation launched last week which could require Big Tech to shoulder more of the costs.

""For me the real challenge is to make sure that by 2030 our fellow citizens and business on our streets across the EU – including here in Barcelona – have access to fast, reliable and data-intense Gigabit connectivity,"" he said.

Representatives from tech firms including Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Meta (META.O) and Netflix (NFLX.O) attending the MWC are expected to push back against the idea.

More than 80,000 people, including tech executives, innovators, and regulators, were expected to attend the event where new product launches will also take the spotlight.

Breton spoke at an opening event where Telefonica CEO Jose Maria Alvarez-Pallete and Orange CEO Christel Heydemann also participated.

Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), Orange (ORAN.PA), Telefonica (TEF.MC) and Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) have been actively lobbying for Big Tech to pay the fees.

""This is the time to collaborate between telcos and Big Tech,"" said Alvarez-Pallete. ""Collaborating means everybody contributing with a fair share of the effort"".

Orange's Heydemann deemed the EU consultation a ""first step"" to address what she called an ""unbalanced situation"", while stressing she was not calling to change Europe's net neutrality principle nor pushing for a new tax mechanism.

""We call for a new European framework which would bring a fair contribution of large online traffic generators to connectivity requirements,"" she said.

The Dutch government on Monday warned against imposing an internet toll on tech companies, becoming the first EU government to criticise Breton's consultation.

It said such a move may breach net neutrality rules and lead to price hikes for Europeans.

Content providers such as Netflix, which has arranged for its CEO Greg Peters to meet with Breton at the Barcelona conference, argue their firms already invest heavily in infrastructure.

They say that paying additional fees will detract from investment in products that benefit consumers.

GSMA, an association representing more than 750 mobile operators and the organising body behind MWC, has been at the forefront of the debate.

""We can really see that this is not (about) neutrality. We are not prioritising. We are not throttling,"" Mats Granryd, GSMA's director general told Reuters.

""So the arguments that normally is brought forward when it comes to net neutrality, we don't really see that but we will be more than happy to have that discussion.""

Critics of the fair share or ""SPNP"" (Sending Party Network Pays) model have warned the so-called ""traffic tax"" could lead content-driven platforms to route their services via ISPs (internet service providers) outside of the EU.

""These new regulations would violate net neutrality provisions and fragment the internet, hurting European consumers and economies,"", said David Frautschy, director at Internet Society, a U.S. nonprofit advocacy group.

""The stakes are too high to let telecom operators get their way.""

Regulations will be difficult to implement and enforce, said Shahid Ahmed, executive vice president at NTT and an adviser to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission.

The MWC will also see new product launches from companies including HMD Global, Honor, Huawei (HWT.UL), RealMe and Xiaomi (1810.HK).

Other hot topics include the 5G adoption rate, which has disappointed some executives, and the potential uses of generative AI systems such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.

851,META,2022-08-16,Cloud hangs over U.S. chipmakers on worries data center growth could slow,"[1/2] 3D-printed clouds and figurines are seen in front of the Microsoft Azure cloud service logo in this illustration taken February 8, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/















Aug 16 (Reuters) - Cloud and data centers, the chip industry's strongest sector, may be its next problem: Signs are showing growth could slow in what has been a pillar during the COVID era as consumers signed up for cloud-based entertainment and companies retooled their offices.

Analysts say the cloud market has rarely had to weather a prolonged economic downturn since it rose to prominence in the last decade as more businesses adopted the technology, making it harder to predict if it's recession proof or it will be hit in an economic downtown.

As 40-year-high inflation weighs on consumers and economists debate recession signals, advertisers have been tightening their purse strings, say Big Tech companies.

“Investors are worried it's the next shoe to drop,"" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, adding that an advertising drought hurting the likes of Facebook (META.O) and Snapchat (SNAP.N) could spur cutbacks in data center investments.

Big Tech has reported slower annual cloud revenue growth rates this earnings season - Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google Cloud dropped over 8 percentage points, Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Azure dropped 6 percentage points, and Amazon.com's (AMZN.O) AWS dropped over 3 percentage points compared with the previous quarter.

Nathaniel Harmon research director of YipitData said the revenue growth of the cloud market was still significant, although noted there were pockets of weakness in regions like Europe creeping in.

The three companies have also said during the pandemic they will keep data center equipment longer, in some cases up to six years, from three, to save money.

“If they're going to be cutting back their spending on data center capacity, well that's fewer chips from Intel or AMD,” said Glenn O'Donnell Research Director at Forrester Research.

That concern was heightened with Intel Corp's (INTC.O) data center and AI group business dropping 16% to $4.6 billion missing Wall Street estimates by nearly $2 billion in its latest quarterly earnings reported.

And last week Micron Technology Inc (MU.O) warned of an even worse than expected outlook, this time adding that there was trouble not just in PCs and smartphone, but also in the cloud.

But it's not as simple as slower growth of the cloud market that's causing trouble, Micron's chief business officer Sumit Sadana, told Reuters. Part of the problem was a shortage of some chips holding up servers from being built leading to a pile up of other chips - a situation similar to the auto chip shortage.

According to Richard Barnett, chief marketing officer at Supplyframe, inventories across the server supply chain are at record highs but key parts are missing. “Assume 500 components are needed for a server, and 10 or 20 unavailable parts are preventing its completion.”

Still Sadana warned that companies, worried about the economy, were also being more conservative about buying chips.

O'Donnell at Forrester said he's seeing this across the tech sector. “As we're talking with our clients about their spending plans, a lot of them are saying, well, you know, we're not going to turn off the faucet, but we're going to close it a bit,” he said. “You're going to see some of that reflected in earnings from companies like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise as well.”

While executives and analysts debate the impact of the slower growth in the cloud market, Super Micro Computer Inc .(SMCI.O), which specializes in customized servers for new technology, said developments such as self-driving cars and the meta-verse are still bringing new waves of demand.

""There's a lot of pent up growth as projects go from lab projects to deployment,"" Michael McNerney, Super Micro's vice president of marketing and network security, said.

852,META,2022-11-01,Cryptoverse: Bitcoin wants to break its bond with stocks,"













Nov 1 (Reuters) - After months of tears and tantrums, bitcoin wants to split up with stock markets.

The cryptocurrency, which has been closely correlated with tech stocks for much of its torrid 2022, is staging one of its strongest efforts yet to break away.

Its 30-day correlation with the Nasdaq (.IXIC) slid to 0.26 last week, its level lowest since early January, where a measure of 1 indicates the two assets are moving in lock step.

The correlation, which shows the degree to which the two move in sync with each other over a 30-day period, has hovered above 0.75 for much of the year and at times has approached perfect unison - at 0.96 and 0.93 in May and September.

For some crypto backers, any bitcoin break-up from Big Tech is a sign of strength.

""The latter's growth has been somewhat tapped out, and investors are looking for the next growth industry. Bitcoin and crypto is one of those 'next' growth industries,"" said Santiago Portela, CEO of FITCHIN, a Web3 gaming ecosystem.

The nascent uncoupling does indeed coincide with a period of comparative calm and consolidation for the teenage cryptocurrency a year after it began its epic nosedive from the heady heights of $69,000 hit in November last year.

Bitcoin is hovering near one-month highs around $20,500 and rose over 5% last week, outperforming the Nasdaq's 2% gain as dour quarterly results from Microsoft (MSFT.O), Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Meta (META.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) weighed.

HODLERS HOLDING OUT

The crypto winter has been cold and hard, though.

The total market cap for cryptocurrencies has shrunk by more than two-thirds to $984 billion from nearly $3 trillion in November 2021, according to CoinMarketCap.com.

A representation of bitcoin is seen in an illustration picture taken on June 23, 2017. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/Illustration/File Photo

Market participation has also dwindled, with the average daily trading volume of digital asset products falling to $61.3 million as of Oct. 25, far from the daily volumes of around $700 million seen last November, CryptoCompare data shows.

Nonetheless, months of persistent selling has failed to shake out the old hands, who are digging in despite a grim economic backdrop.

The dollar wealth held in bitcoins that haven't been traded for three months or more is at an all-time-high, indicating accumulation by long-term holders or ""HODLers"", according to blockchain data firm Glassnode. The name for that group of diehard crypto investors emerged years ago from a trader misspelling ""hold"" on an online forum.

Furthermore, a record 55,000 bitcoin were withdrawn from the largest exchange Binance on Oct. 26, according to analytics platform CryptoQuant showed, flows that typically signal coins are moving to wallets for longer-term storage.

""The holder base of BTC has changed drastically from being heavily weighted towards speculators, which largely came in in 2021, to the near cult-like 'HODLer' community which would not sell their BTC in almost any macro circumstance,"" said Stéphane Ouellette, CEO at crypto derivatives provider FRNT Financial.

""The market is now looking to the Fed meeting next week for further confirmation of the risk asset/BTC correlation breakdown.""

NEXT FOR FICKLE BITCOIN?

Samuel Reid, CEO of consulting firm Geometric Energy Corporation said heavy outflows from exchanges could potentially indicate some large buyers were ""sniffing out"" the end of the bear market.

Yet it's anyone's guess whether fickle bitcoin will begin to rally, or slide anew, or if it will swiftly rebound to the embrace of technology stocks.

For the foreseeable future, macroeconomics remain the driver of a market that remains highly speculative in nature.

""The more speculative crypto is, the more it is tied to macro,"" said Alex Miller, CEO of blockchain firm Hiro Systems.

""It comes back to, what are the use cases and what's the productive capability of the asset? The more it's being used for other things, the less it'll be tied to macro.""

(This story has been corrected to say cryptocurrency market value has shrunk by two-thirds, not a third in the past year, in paragraph 12)

853,META,2023-01-18,"Microsoft to shed 10,000 jobs, adding to glut of tech layoffs","













DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Wednesday said it would eliminate 10,000 jobs and take a $1.2 billion charge to earnings, as its cloud-computing customers reassess their spending and the company braces for potential recession.

The layoffs add to the tens of thousands announced in recent months across the technology sector, which has downshifted following a strong growth period during the pandemic.

The news comes even as the software maker is set to ramp up spending in generative artificial intelligence that the industry sees as the new bright spot.

In a note to employees, CEO Satya Nadella attempted to address the divergent outlook for different parts of the business.

Customers wanted to ""optimize their digital spend to do more with less"" and ""exercise caution as some parts of the world are in a recession and other parts are anticipating one,"" he said. ""At the same time, the next major wave of computing is being born with advances in AI.""

Nadella said the layoffs, affecting less than 5% of Microsoft's workforce, would conclude by the end of March, with notifications beginning Wednesday.

However, Microsoft would keep hiring in ""strategic areas,"" he said. AI is likely to be one of those areas. Nadella this week touted AI to world leaders gathered in Davos, Switzerland, claiming the technology would transform its products and touch people around the globe.

Microsoft has looked at adding to its $1-billion stake in OpenAI, the startup behind the Silicon Valley chatbot sensation known as ChatGPT, which Microsoft plans to soon market through its cloud service.

Shares of the Redmond, Washington-based company ended 2% lower on Wednesday.

The announcement corresponds with the start of layoffs at its retail and cloud-computing rival Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), which started notifying employees Wednesday of its own 18,000-person job cuts.

In an internal memo seen by Reuters, Amazon said that affected workers in the United States, Canada and Costa Rica would be informed by the end of the day. Employees in China will be notified after the Chinese New Year.

Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) has announced cuts of 11,000 jobs, while cloud-based software company Salesforce Inc (CRM.N) said it would cut 10% of its 80,000-member workforce.

Overall, in 2022, more than 97,000 job cuts in tech were announced, the highest for the sector since 2002, when 131,000 cuts were announced, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

""We haven't seen this activity since the dot-com bust,"" said Andrew Challenger, the company's senior vice president.

Microsoft is terminating 878 full-time workers at its Redmond headquarters, according to an update on Washington State's Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) page. Under U.S. law, most employers are required to report staff cuts affecting 50 or more workers at a single location.

CLOUD GROWTH DECLINING

Microsoft's billion-dollar charge will cut profit by 12 cents a share in the company's second fiscal quarter this year, and could resonate beyond the tech sector, some analysts said.

""Here's one of the marquee growth companies with a very distinct user base saying that perhaps economic conditions aren't nearly as good as we thought they were,"" said Brian Frank, a portfolio manager at Frank Funds who has owned Microsoft stock on and off over the last several years.

The charge is attributable to severance costs as well as adjustments to Microsoft's hardware lineup and lease consolidation to build higher-density workspaces, Nadella said.

Microsoft declined to detail the hardware changes or say if it would stop developing any product line.

Microsoft's cloud revenues soared in recent years from an explosion in corporate demand to host data online and handle computing in the so-called cloud. But growth slowed to 35% in the first fiscal quarter of 2023, and the company projects more cooling to come. In July last year, it said a small number of roles had been eliminated.

854,META,2023-01-25,Microsoft cloud outage hits users around the world,"Summary

Summary Companies Outage impacts Microsoft cloud platform Azure for hours

Multiple Microsoft services including Teams and Outlook hit

Microsoft says most customers now have service restored

Shares down 3.2%















Jan 25 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Wednesday it had recovered all of its cloud services after a networking outage took down its cloud platform Azure along with services such as Teams and Outlook used by millions around the globe.

Azure's status page showed services were impacted in Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa. Only services in China and its platform for governments were not hit.

By late morning Azure said most customers should have seen services resume after a full recovery of the Microsoft Wide Area Network (WAN).

An outage of Azure, which has 15 million corporate customers and over 500 million active users, according to Microsoft data, can impact multiple services and create a domino effect as almost all of the world's largest companies use the platform.

Businesses have become increasingly dependent on online platforms after the pandemic caused a shift to more employees working from home.

Earlier, Microsoft said it had determined a network connectivity issue was occurring with devices across the Microsoft WAN. This impacts connectivity between clients on the internet to Azure, as well as connectivity between services in data centres, it said.

Microsoft later tweeted that it had rolled back a network change that it believed was causing the issue and was using ""additional infrastructure to expedite the recovery process"".

Microsoft did not disclose the number of users affected by the disruption, but data from outage tracking website Downdetector showed thousands of incidents across continents.

The Downdetector site tracks outages by collating status reports from various sources including users.

Microsoft's cloud business had helped shore up its fiscal second-quarter earnings on Tuesday. It forecast third-quarter revenue in its so-called intelligent cloud business would be $21.7 billion to $22 billion despite worries that the lucrative cloud segment for big tech companies could be hit hard as customers look to cut spending.

Azure's share of the cloud computing market rose to 30% in 2022, trailing Amazon's AWS, according to estimates from BofA Global Research.

Microsoft joined other big tech companies in turning to layoffs to ride out the weaker economy, announcing last week it was cutting over 10,000 jobs.

Its shares were down 3.2% at $234.41.

Outages of Big Tech platforms are not uncommon as several companies ranging from Google (GOOGL.O) to Meta (META.O) have seen service disruptions. Azure, the second largest cloud services provider after Amazon (AMZN.O), faced outages last year.

During the outage, users faced problems in exchanging messages, joining calls or using any features of Teams application. Many users took to Twitter to share updates about the service disruption, with #MicrosoftTeams trending as a hashtag on the social media site.

Microsoft Teams, used by more than 280 million people globally, forms an integral part of daily operations for businesses and schools, which use the service to make calls, schedule meetings and organise their workflow.

There were few signs of significant disruption at major UK-based financial services firms, where multiple messaging applications offered by providers like Movius and Symphony are used alongside Microsoft Teams to connect bankers with clients, and office-based staff with colleagues working remotely.

Two London-based sources, working at two major global banks, said they hadn't even noticed a problem.

Deutsche Boerse Group, which operates the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, said there had been no impact on trading. Frankfurt-based Commerzbank AG (CBKG.DE) said in a statement that Microsoft was investigating several issues impacting the bank.

Among the other services affected were Microsoft Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, according to the company's status page.

""I think there is a very big debate to be had on resiliency in the comms and cloud space and the critical applications,"" Symphony Chief Executive Brad Levy said.

April 28 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) on Thursday reported revenue and ad sales that fell short of expectations and were depressed by the ongoing war in Ukraine, laying out the challenges billionaire Elon Musk will face if he takes over the social media company.

The company also reported 12 million new users in the quarter, its highest rise in users since the height of the pandemic, and the mixed news left the shares up 0.6% in late morning trade.

The report could be Twitter's last as a public company, although the stock price, which is at an 11% discount to Musk's offer price, indicates substantial doubts that Musk will go through with the deal. read more

""Elon Musk is buying Twitter at a time when the company is struggling to attract new users following the pandemic-driven surge,"" said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com.

To put Twitter's user growth in perspective, since the height of the pandemic, sequential quarterly increases have ranged between 1 million and 7 million, after growing by 20 million daily active users in the second quarter of 2020.

The company would need to add at least 12 million users every quarter until the end of next year to achieve the ambitious 2023 goals it set for itself, which Twitter has now disavowed because of the deal.

""We think macro issues will take (Twitter) further away from its previously-stated 2023 goals,"" said Angelo Zino, analyst at CFRA Research. ""We believe results along with ongoing ad related industry headwinds solidify the Board's decision to approve the Musk offer, as we see little reason to believe (Twitter) could extract greater shareholder value remaining public.""

Twitter has long faced criticism for its sluggish pace of product launches. Musk has tweeted suggestions ranging from releasing a widely-demanded edit button to making the Twitter algorithm open-source.

When Musk closes the deal, he will be overseeing a company that has had long-standing struggles with internal dysfunction, indecision and lack of accountability, Reuters previously reported according to eight current and former Twitter employees. read more

Daily active users on Twitter rose to 229 million in the first quarter ended March 31, from 199 million a year earlier. The average analyst expectation was 226.8 million.

Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (FB.O) also reported a return to user growth on Wednesday, which helped propel social media stocks higher.

Twitter said an internal error resulted in the company overstating quarterly user numbers by about 1.5 million between the fourth quarter of 2020 to the end of 2021. The company said it also overstated the figures in 2019, but was unable to provide data.

Given the pending acquisition, Twitter said it would not provide any forward looking guidance and was withdrawing all previous goals and outlook. The company last year announced it aimed to double annual revenue and grow to 315 million users by 2023, as former CEO Jack Dorsey aimed to signal a reset on years of product stagnation. read more

Total revenue in the first quarter was $1.2 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $1.23 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The war in Ukraine affected revenue growth, Twitter said in a press release.

The company earns the majority of its revenue from selling digital ads on the website and app. Twitter paused ads in Ukraine and Russia in February amid the ongoing invasion, which the Kremlin calls a ""special military operation.""

""The macro environment is becoming hostile with advertisers curbing their spending as they deal with inflation, which is running at a four-decade high,"" Anwar said.

Musk has said that Twitter should not serve advertising, which would allow the platform to have more control over its content policies. Advertisers generally prefer strong content moderation, to help prevent their brand from appearing next to unsuitable content.

Its net income rose to $513.3 million, or 61 cents per share, from $68 million, 8 cents per share, a year earlier.

856,META,2022-10-04,"Pakistan out of money for flood recovery, UN boosts aid request- minister","Summary Pakistan is out of money to help flood recovery

Millions of displaced families need immediate support

Pakistan in 'urgent need of medicine' as diseases spread

UN revises aid appeal up five-fold to $816 million















ISLAMABAD, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Pakistan is out of money to spend on recovery from devastating floods, its climate change minister said on Tuesday, urging prompt international help at the U.N. launch of an aid appeal as funds needed by the country were ramped up five-fold.

The United Nations revised up its humanitarian aid appeal for Pakistan five-fold to $816 million from $160 million, as a surge of water-borne diseases and fear of growing hunger pose new dangers after weeks of unprecedented flooding linked to climate warming.

The meeting was told that the U.N has received only $90 million so far out of the $160-million previous appeal for aid.

""We have no space to give our economy a stimulus package, which would create jobs, and provide people with the sustainable incomes they need,"" the climate change minister, Sherry Rehman, told the conference in Geneva aimed at seeking aid for Pakistan.

She urged the developed world to accelerate funding for the ongoing domestic climate-linked disaster, terming it ""the meta-climate event of a century.""

Pakistan has already dispersed cash handouts worth $264 million to 2.47 million people affected by the disaster, she added.

She said 7.9 million people have been displaced.

""We are gathered here to reboot your compassion simply because the numbers are too staggering to service for any one country alone,"" she said.

The European Union (EU) scaled up its flood assistance to 30 million euros (6.7 billion Pakistani rupees), according to a statement after the EU commissioner for crises management, Janez Lenarčič, met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Islamabad.

Pakistan's economic affairs minister Ayaz Sadiq told the gathering that it would take ""years and years"" for the country to rebuild and help rehabilitate millions of people whose homes were destroyed by the flooding.

The floods, caused by abnormal monsoon rains and glacial melt, have submerged huge swathes of the South Asian country and killed nearly 1,700 people, most of them women and children.

Hundreds of thousands of displaced people who are living in the open are being exposed to diseases like malaria, diarrhoea, dengue fever, severe skin and eyes infections, cholera, dog and snake bites, all of which are fast spreading amid stagnant floodwaters that officials say will take several months to recede.

The diseases have killed hundreds in addition to the 1,700 deaths from the flooding, and tens of thousands of them are treated daily at make-shift hospitals.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, told the meeting Pakistan needed an urgent and robust response, supported by sustainable funding, to control the spread of outbreaks.

""We are on the verge of a public health disaster,"" he said and added: ""The water has stopped rising, but the danger has not.""

He said the WHO needed $115 million to meet the health emergency.

Approximately 10% of Pakistan's health facilities have been damaged, leaving millions without access to health care, he said, adding that the stocks of essential medicines and medical supplies were limited or have been washed away.

URGENT NEED FOR MEDICINE

The deluge has impacted 33 million people out of a population of 220 million, and caused damage the government estimates at $30 billion as crops, roads, livestock, bridges, houses, schools, and medical facilities were washed away.

The government and the United Nations have blamed climate change for the disaster.

Julien Harneis, the U.N. resident coordinator and humanitarian coordinator in Pakistan said the $816 million target for the appeal was ""absolutely not enough"".

""We need all of these funds and we need it quickly,"" he said.

Rehman said 8.2 million people were in urgent need of medicine, including 4% of the disaster-affected population that was pregnant, and export crops were almost all wiped out, pushing the country to import food.

""These are real people on the ground, whose eyes are still vacant from shock, who have overnight been turned into poster-children of extreme vulnerability, with futures that are entirely precarious,"" she said.

""All we are saying is please don't leave us alone.""

857,META,2022-05-16,"Yellen reaches no breakthrough in Poland tax talks, says more work needed","













WARSAW, May 16 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said there was no breakthrough in talks on Monday to persuade Poland to implement a 15% global corporate minimum tax and more work was needed to address Warsaw’s concerns.

Poland is the lone holdout in the European Union's implementation plan for the minimum tax after it vetoed a compromise in April to launch the 137-country agreement reached last October aiming to end a competitive downward spiral in corporate tax rates. Poland's acceptance is essential for the deal to proceed. read more

""We strongly believe it's in the interest of Poland to be part of this so we've had very good, frank discussions,"" Yellen told reporters after meeting with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, Polish Finance Minister Magdalena Rzeczkowska and central bank governor Adam Glapinski in Warsaw.

Yellen said she hoped Poland would come on board with the EU plan ""in the not too distant future.""

But she added that she did not think it was practical ""to have any kind of strong link between"" the global minimum tax and the other pillar of global tax negotiations, a reallocation of some taxing rights for large, highly profitable multinationals to “market countries” where their services and products are sold.

Rzeczkowska has sought a ""legally binding"" link between the two, raising concerns that if the more complicated tax reallocation fails, the global minimum tax would burden international businesses in the country and may cut revenues.

For some countries participating in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's negotiations, the reallocation plan is more desired, allowing them to collect revenue from U.S. technology giants such as Google owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

But the reallocation pillar was not part of the October deal and its terms need further negotiations. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, current chair of EU finance ministers, has expressed scepticism over those arguments amid legal disputes between Poland and the EU.

REVENUES DISPUTED

The United States agrees with the EU Tax Observatory’s estimate that the minimum tax would bring Poland an extra 2 billion euros ($2.08 billion) in annual revenue – paid by big multinational companies, not Polish domestic firms - and argues this could help defray the high costs of hosting Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion.

Yellen said the Polish officials “have a more pessimistic view that we need to work through” on the revenue estimate and some views on ways to link reallocation of taxing rights to the minimum tax that the Treasury will study.

A statement from the Polish prime minister's office made no mention of the tax deal but focused on coordinating international efforts to put pressure on Russia to end its war in Ukraine and reducing dependence on Russian energy.

""Poland will continue to call for further tightening of EU sanctions, especially in the energy, finance, transport and services sectors,"" it said. ""We must reduce Russia's economic and military potential as soon as possible.""

After the talks in Warsaw, Yellen is due to meet EU officials in Brussels and a Group of Seven finance leaders in Germany on Thursday and Friday.

U.S. UNCERTAINTY

Yellen needed to reassure Polish officials about growing uncertainties over U.S. implementation of the global minimum tax, said Manal Corwin, head of KPMG's Washington national tax practice and a former U.S. Treasury official.

The U.S. Congress needs to approve changes to the current 10.5% U.S. global overseas minimum tax known as ""GILTI,"" raising the rate to 15% and converting it to a country-by-country system.

The changes were initially included in U.S. President Joe Biden's sweeping social and climate bill, which stalled last year after objections from centrist Senate Democrats.

But prospects for a slimmed-down spending package with the tax changes look increasingly difficult as midterm congressional elections approach and as lawmakers voice concerns about more spending amid high inflation.

Corwin said lack of U.S. implementation will likely not halt the other 136 countries from proceeding, especially if Poland can be brought on board with EU implementation. Pressure for U.S. implementation would ultimately build as the system would siphon some tax revenues to other countries, she said.

June 26 (Reuters) - The largest U.S. law firms did not take a public stance following the U.S. Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade on Friday, diverging from the approach of some major companies that have made statements on the closely watched abortion case.

The high court's 6-3 Dobbs decision upheld a Republican-backed Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Many states are expected to further restrict or ban abortions following the ruling.

Reuters on Friday asked more than 30 U.S. law firms, including the 20 largest by total number of lawyers, for comments on the Dobbs ruling and whether they would cover travel costs for employees seeking an abortion.

The vast majority did not respond by Saturday afternoon, and only two, Ropes & Gray and Morrison & Foerster, said they would implement such a travel policy.

Morrison & Foerster, with nearly 1,000 attorneys, was the only large firm to issue a public statement by Saturday afternoon.

The firm's chair, Larren Nashelsky, said Morrison & Foerster would ""redouble our efforts to protect abortion and other reproductive rights.""

The Dobbs decision has been expected since a draft opinion was leaked in May.

Several major U.S. corporations, including The Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Meta Platforms (META.O) said on Friday they will cover travel costs for employees seeking abortions. read more

Industry experts say law firms could speak out on Dobbs in the future if employees and clients push them to take a public stance. For now, firm leaders appear to be carefully weighing the advantages and disadvantages of commenting, including the possibility of alienating clients, experts said.

“This is a tightrope to walk for firms,” said Kent Zimmermann, a law firm consultant with the Zeughauser Group. “They have a diversity of views among their talent and clients.”

Some firms have issued internal communications to employees about the decision. Ropes & Gray Chair Julie Jones said in an internal memo viewed by Reuters that the firm will hold several community gatherings to discuss the ruling and offer ""comfort.""

“As a leader of Ropes & Gray, I am concerned about the effect of this decision on our community,” Jones wrote, while acknowledging that her memo may cause “offense to portions of our community.""

A Ropes & Gray spokesperson told Reuters Friday that employees enrolled in its medical plan are eligible for financial assistance to travel out of state for an abortion.

Another large U.S. law firm, Steptoe & Johnson, offered its U.S. workforce the day off on Friday, a spokesperson confirmed. The spokesperson did not immediately respond to further requests for comment.

Despite a dearth of public statements, a number of law firms publicly signaled ahead of the ruling that they planned to provide free legal support to women seeking abortions if Roe was overturned.

Both the New York Attorney General Leticia James and the San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu, with the Bar Association of San Francisco, have convened pro bono initiatives that rely on law firm volunteers. Paul Weiss, Gibson Dunn & Crutcher and O'Melveny & Myers are among the participants.

Paul Weiss Chair Brad Karp called the Dobbs decision a ""crushing loss"" in an internal message to the firm on Friday provided to Reuters. Paul Weiss and O'Melveny, which both represented Jackson Women's Health Organization, respondents in the Dobbs case, deferred comment on the ruling to their co-counsel, the Center for Reproductive Rights.

The center said in a statement that the court had ""hit a new low by taking away – for the first time ever – a constitutionally guaranteed personal liberty.""

Gibson Dunn did not respond to request for comment.

Robert Kamins, a consultant with Vertex Advisors who works with law firms, said firms will be ""very cautious"" about taking early positions on the ruling.

“They have to make sure that they are being thoughtful about it,"" he said. ""What is the business impact? What is the client impact? What is the recruiting impact? There are lots of things to think about.”

April 25 (Reuters) - Wall Street rose on Monday, with the Nasdaq ending sharply higher after Twitter agreed to be bought by billionaire Elon Musk, sparking a late day rally in growth stocks.

Twitter (TWTR.N) ended up 5.6% after announcing it would be bought by Musk in a deal that will shift control of the social media giant to the world's richest person. read more

The S&P 500 traded in negative territory for much of the session but extended gains after Twitter's announcement. The S&P 500 growth index (.IGX) ended up over 1%, also bouncing back from an earlier decline.

""You can tell growth wanted to rally all day but the market was holding it down. The Twitter news came and that was just a green light to start buying some of the growth names. They have been oversold for a while,"" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Bright Trading LLC.

Earlier, uncertainty reverberated across world markets, with Chinese shares marking their biggest slump since a pandemic-led selling in February 2020 and European stocks falling to their lowest in over a month on fears of strict restrictions in China.

The S&P energy index (.SPNY) dropped 3.3% as Brent crude prices dropped almost 5% toward $100 a barrel.

Oil majors Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and ExxonMobil (XOM.N) declined more than 2%, and oilfield services companies Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) and Halliburton Co (HAL.N) also fell more than 6%.

Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) rallied 2.9% ahead of its quarterly report after the bell on Tuesday. Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Facebook owner Meta Platforms (FB.O) also gained.

Nearly a third of S&P 500 index firms are due to report this week. Of the 102 companies in the S&P 500 that posted earnings so far, 77.5% reported above analysts' expectations, according to Refinitiv data.

""Earnings are going to be crucial to the mindset of the of the average investor. The playbook was buy Apple, buy Netflix, buy Google and throw away the key, but that playbook is no longer working,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer at Longbow Asset Management. ""What is the outlook for these companies going to be?""

Bleak results from pandemic darling Netflix (NFLX.O) along with surging bond yields pummeled high-growth stocks last week, bringing year-to-date losses in the tech-heavy Nasdaq (.IXIC) to about 18%.

Traders are pricing in big moves by the Fed this year to control inflation after a series of hawkish remarks from policymakers. Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week gave a ""go"" sign to a half-point rate hike in May and signaled he would be open to ""front-end loading"" the U.S. central bank's retreat from super-easy monetary policy. read more

Indexes fall: Dow 3.12%, S&P 3.56%, Nasdaq 4.99%















May 5 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended Thursday sharply lower amid a broad sell-off, as investor sentiment cratered in the face of concerns that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike the previous day would not be enough to tame surging inflation.

All three main Wall Street benchmarks erased gains made during a relief rally on Wednesday, with the Nasdaq posting its biggest one-day percentage decline since June 2020 and its lowest finish since November 2020.

The Dow's decline was its worst daily performance since October 2020.

Technology megacaps slumped. Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Meta Platforms (FB.O), Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) all fell between 4.3% and 8.3%.

However, it was not just high-growth stocks, which have struggled in 2022 as the prospect of rate rises had investors questioning their future earnings potential. The selloff hit all areas of the market, as traders headed for the exits.

""Investors aren't looking at fundamentals (such as earnings) right now, and this is more of a sentiment issue,"" said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors.

The U.S. central bank on Wednesday raised interest rates by half a percentage point as expected and Fed Chair Jerome Powell explicitly ruled out a hike of 75 basis points in a coming meeting.

Worries about Fed policy moves, mixed earnings from some big growth companies, the conflict in Ukraine and pandemic-related lockdowns in China have hammered Wall Street recently, overshadowing a better-than-expected quarterly reporting season.

Only 19 of the S&P 500's constituents closed in positive territory, one of which was Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), which ended 2.6% higher.

Elon Musk revealed on Thursday that Oracle's co-founder Larry Ellison and Sequoia Capital were among investors that would back his takeover of the social media giant with $7.14 billion of financing. read more

All of the 11 major S&P sectors declined, with consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) leading the way with a 5.8% drop. The index was dragged by Etsy Inc (ETSY.O) and eBay Inc (EBAY.O), down 16.8% and 11.7% respectively, after both forecast Q2 revenue would be below Wall Street's estimates.

The technology sector (.SPLRCT) was the next biggest loser, down 4.9%, with Intuit Inc (INTU.O) among those weighing the heaviest. It slipped 8.5%, to its lowest finish in a year, a day after agreeing to pay a $141 million settlement centered on deception claims around its TurboTax product. read more

""You're seeing those areas of the market which are purely discretionary, they are the ones getting hit today because everyone is anticipating that this is going to be a challenging period for consumers over the next several quarters,"" said Horneman of Verdence Capital Advisors.

The CBOE Volatility index (.VIX), also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, climbed to 31.20 points.

The focus now shifts to the U.S. Labor Department's closely watched monthly employment report on Friday for clues on labor market strength and its impact on monetary policy.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 13.45 billion shares, compared with the 12.01 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Gold dips, bitcoin advances















BOSTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Treasury yields marched higher on Tuesday, bringing U.S. stocks with them, as investors digested the increased likelihood of swift interest rate hikes following hawkish comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve.

The Nasdaq (.IXIC) led Wall Street's main indexes higher, rising nearly 2%, as investors bought the dip in technology stocks, including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O). read more

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 254.87 points, or 0.74%, to 34,807.86 and the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 50.63 points, or 1.13%, to 4,511.81.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Monday the central bank could move ""more aggressively"" to raise rates to fight inflation, possibly hiking by more than 25 basis points at one or more meetings this year. read more

The market is pricing in a 72.2% probability that the Fed will hike the fed fund rate 50 basis points when policymakers meet in May, up from a probability of just over 50% on Monday.

At around 2000 GMT, or 4:00 p.m. ET, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.38%, having hit its highest level since 2019 . The 2-year note also ticked up, to yield 2.16%, from 2.13%.

“The degree of difficulty for Jerome Powell’s Fed to stick a soft landing for the economy is about the same as Captain Sullenberger’s heroic emergency landing on the Hudson River,"" said Aaron Clark, a portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management in Boston, referring to the 2009 landing of a US Airways plane after its engines failed.

""The market remains in a tug of war between a policy error causing a recession and a resilient economy with a strong consumer and corporate sector,"" Clark wrote in an email.

Stocks also rose in Europe. The STOXX 600 (.STOXX) gained 0.85%, having climbed in recent sessions to reach a one-month high. London's FTSE 100 (.FTSE) gained nearly 0.5%. read more

The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, was up approximately 1.1% (.MIWD00000PUS).

Matthias Scheiber, global head of multiasset portfolio management at Allspring Global Investments in London, said the pickup in stocks could be a case of investors buying the dip, but that growth stocks would struggle if the U.S. 10-year yield moves closer to 2.5%.

""We saw the sharp rise in yields yesterday and we see that continuing today on the long end, so that’s likely to put pressure on equities. ... It will be hard for equities to have a positive performance.""

JPMorgan took a different view and said that 80% of its clients plan to increase equity exposure, which is a record high.

""With positioning light, sentiment weak and geopolitical risks likely to ease over time, we believe risks are skewed to the upside,"" JPMorgan strategists wrote in a note to clients.

""We believe investors should add risk in areas that overshot on the downside such as innovation, tech, biotech, EM/China, and small caps. These segments are pricing in a severe global recession, which will not materialize, in our view.""

The conflict in Ukraine continued to weigh on sentiment. Russia, the U.S. and Britain traded accusations at the United Nations on Tuesday over the possibility of a chemical weapons attack in Ukraine, but none produced any evidence to back their concerns. read more

Oil prices pulled back less than 1% on Tuesday as the dollar strengthened and it looked unlikely that the European Union would pursue an embargo on Russian oil, a day after prices jumped 7% and also rose earlier in the session. read more

The dollar edged lower on Tuesday as the boost from Powell's comments faded and a rise in equities markets help boost risk-on sentiment. read more

The false representations of the two journalists, Shanghai bureau chief Brenda Goh and Hong Kong-based correspondent Jessie Pang, starting in late November, appeared on platforms including Instagram and the Telegram message app.

The impersonator or impersonators were seeking information about a group linked to protests the same month against China's strict COVID-19 controls, according to screenshots and several accounts provided to Reuters.

An Australia-based Chinese activist and dissident artist known as Badiucao first disclosed the impersonations on Saturday on Twitter.

A fake account was set up on Instagram and one on Telegram purporting to be Pang, according to screengrabs from Badiucao seen by Reuters. Another activist told Reuters he had conversed with a fake persona of Goh via Telegram for three months.

Badiucao tweeted that he had been approached on Telegram by someone purporting to be Pang, asking for information on a Chinese-language online platform called Citizens Daily that carries protest art.

""Hello everyone,"" an imposter wrote in a Telegram chatroom, according to screenshots seen by Reuters that were provided by Badiucao. ""I am Jessie with Reuters."" The imposter then asked two members of the group: ""Do you two have any ties to Citizens Daily?""

The imposter sought to gain the group's trust by giving details of Pang's background and recent work, Badiucao said.

Badiucao said he became suspicious at the language and questions posed by the imposter, however, and asked to verify the person's identity through Pang's verified Twitter account.

The imposter said he or she had no control over the Twitter account, as it was ""run by a team at Reuters"", a screenshot of the conversation provided by Badiucao showed.

The person then sent Badiucao, a political cartoonist prominent among protesters, a photo of Pang's press ID, which had expired.

Reuters could not ascertain who was behind the fake journalist personas. After the fakes were exposed, all their known accounts and conversations were deleted. None of Goh's or Pang's official social media accounts appeared to have been hacked.

A Reuters spokesperson said: ""We are looking into the impersonation and theft of press credentials of Reuters journalists and will take appropriate action.""

A spokesperson for Instagram owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) said the platform had taken down the imposter’s account, declining to comment further. Telegram did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on the impersonations of the journalists' accounts on that platform.

A spokesman for Hong Kong's Security Bureau said: ""Members of the public are encouraged to report to the Police if there is any suspected crime. The Police will take appropriate actions on reports of crime accordingly.""

An administrator at Citizens Daily, responding to a request for comment, said the group suspected Chinese state involvement in the impersonations. The administrator declined to give their name, citing the risk of reprisals, and did not offer any evidence to support this assertion.

China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Cyberspace Administration of China and the Public Security Bureau did not respond to requests for comment on Citizens Daily's claim or on the impersonation of the journalists.

Citizens Daily had been a conduit for sharing information among protesters during the November demonstrations in multiple Chinese cities against Beijing's zero-COVID policy, with some calling for President Xi Jinping to step down and an end to Communist Party rule.

The civil disobedience was unprecedented in mainland China since Xi assumed power a decade ago, sparking a wave of arrests and a broad security clampdown.

An activist with the Twitter handle ""accelflopping"" told Reuters that an imposter purporting to be Goh contacted him via Telegram. To gain his trust, the person showed a picture of Goh's press card and provided other personal details, including Goh's nationality.

This activist, who is based overseas, said he only learned of the subterfuge from Badiucao on Saturday after having communicated with the ""fake Brenda"" since late November about his group's plans for future protests. They spoke via Telegram text message, apart from one short phone call, he said.

He declined to disclose his name, citing sensitivities.

A person with the Twitter handle ""775lighting"" tweeted about also having been approached several times since Feb. 4 by a ""fake Jessie"" Pang, who sought to ""steal sensitive details"" about their protest activities.

Reuters could not reach this person for comment.

863,META,2022-12-30,"Inflation, recession and earnings among factors to drive U.S. stocks in 2023","













NEW YORK, Dec 30 (Reuters) - U.S. stock investors could not be more eager to turn the page on 2022, a brutal year that lopped about $8 trillion in market capitalization from the S&P 500 as the Federal Reserve unleashed a barrage of rate hikes to fight the steepest inflation in 40 years.

The S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 19.4% for the year in its biggest annual percentage drop since 2008. The carnage was even more severe for the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC), which tumbled by 33.1%.

High-profile casualties include the once-soaring shares of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), which slumped nearly 50% this year, while those of Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) fell around 65% and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) lost about 64%. Meanwhile, energy stocks (.SPNY) have bucked the trend by posting eye-popping gains.

S&P 500 timeline in 2022

Inflation, and the Fed's degree of aggressiveness in trying to contain it, will likely remain a critical factor driving equity performance as 2023 gets under way. But investors will also be watching for fallout from higher interest rates, including how tighter monetary policy ripples through the economy and whether it makes other assets more competitive with stocks.

Here is a look at some of the big themes for the U.S. stock market in 2023.

RECESSION OR SOFT LANDING?

Perhaps the biggest question that will sway stocks as the new year begins is whether the economy is headed for a recession, as many investors are expecting.

If a recession starts next year, stocks could be set for another slide: A bear market has never bottomed before the beginning of a recession, historic data showed.

Recessions tend to hit stocks hard, with the S&P 500 falling an average of 29% during recessions since World War Two, according to Truist Advisory Services. Those declines, however, have usually been followed by a strong rebound.

PROFITS AT RISK?

Investors are also concerned that corporate earnings estimates may not have fully factored in a potential slowdown, leaving more downside for stocks.

Consensus analyst estimates as of last week projected S&P 500 earnings to rise 4.4% in 2023, according to Refinitiv IBES. Yet earnings fall by an average annual rate of 24% during recessions, according to Ned Davis Research.

GOODBYE, TINA?

The Fed’s rate hikes have pushed up bond yields and created competition for equities, flying in the face of the low-yield environment that predominated for more than a decade and gave rise to the acronym “TINA,” or “there is no alternative” to stocks.

Yields on the 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) - also known as real yields because they strip out projected inflation - recently stood at around 1.6%, after hitting their highest level in over a decade in October.

Still, some investors have noted that stocks fared well in past periods when yields were even higher.

CAN VALUE VAULT AHEAD?

In the past year, value stocks - commonly defined as those trading at a discount on metrics such as book value or price-to-earnings - held up better than tech and other growth shares, reversing trends that had been in place for much of the past decade.

With higher yields and doubts about profit growth standing to pressure tech and growth stocks, the question is whether value - which is more heavily represented by financial, energy and defensive groups - could be poised for another year of outperformance.

DOLLAR MAKING A DENT

The dollar’s surge against other currencies this year hurt the earnings of many U.S. companies, making it more expensive for multinationals to convert their earnings back into their home currency.

The greenback has pared some of those gains in recent weeks and a continued reversal would depend in part on investor perceptions of how hawkish the Fed will be relative to other global central banks.

864,META,2023-03-14,Are they for real? South Korean girl band offers glimpse into metaverse,"













SEOUL, March 14 (Reuters) - Less than two months ago, the first music video by South Korean girl quartet MAVE: went viral, racking up nearly 20 million views on YouTube and setting the stage for potential global success.

At first glance, MAVE: looks like any other idolised K-pop band - except it only exists virtually. Its four members - SIU, ZENA, TYRA and MARTY - live in the metaverse, their songs, dances, interviews and even their hairstyles created by web designers and artificial intelligence.

""When I first saw Mave, it was a little confusing to tell whether they were humans or virtual characters,"" said Han Su-min, a 19-year-old in Seoul. ""Because I use metaverse platforms with my friends often, I feel like I could become their fan.""

The group's almost human-like avatars provide an early glimpse of how the metaverse is likely to evolve as South Korea's entertainment and tech industries join hands in the fledgling technology.

It also represents a serious push by tech giant Kakao Corp (035720.KS) to become a dominant force in entertainment. Apart from backing MAVE:, Kakao launched a 1.25 trillion won ($960 million) tender offer last week to buy South Korean K-pop pioneer SM Entertainment (041510.KQ).

SM is home to popular K-pop groups such as Girls' Generation, H.O.T., EXO, Red Velvet, Super Junior, SHINee, NCT Dream and Aespa.

Kakao declined comment on how it would balance the demands of managing real and virtual bands.

The company's bet on the metaverse bucks a global trend. Big tech companies from Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc META.O to China's Tencent Holdings 0700.HK are now reining in their spending on virtual worlds to ride out the economic downturn.

Kakao has said earlier that it has invested 12 billion won in Metaverse Entertainment, a subsidiary it formed with gaming firm Netmarble Corp (251270.KS) to create MAVE:.

But the company declined to make any income forecasts from the venture.

MAVE: is an ""ongoing"" project to explore new business opportunities and find ways to work around technological challenges, said Chu Ji-yeon, who heads Metaverse Entertainment.

The concept is not new in South Korea. In 1998, virtual singer Adam was launched, and two decades later, K-pop girl group K/DA, inspired by characters from video game League of Legends, also made a debut. Neither took off.

But South Korean technology has made much progress since then in creating virtual characters. MAVE: is more natural-looking thanks to new tools and artificial intelligence that developers used to create facial expressions and small details like streaks in hair, viewers say.

With the aid of an AI voice generator, its members can speak four languages - Korean, English, French and Bahasa. But they can't speak in response to prompts and have to rely on scripts prepared by humans.

The group's voices heard in the debut single ""Pandora"" and the choreography in the music video were created by human performers and processed by motion capture and real-time 3D rendering technologies.

Experts say the COVID-19 pandemic aided the growth of such virtual characters, as many K-pop companies pivoted to online content to satiate home-bound fans.

""Fans became more used to consuming non-face-to-face content and communication with their idol groups for nearly three years,"" said Lee Jong-im, a pop culture critic who teaches at Seoul National University. ""It seems they have become more accepting of the concept that virtual and actual idol groups can integrate.""

While virtual groups like MAVE: are making headlines for their novelty, questions remain over whether they can match the interaction between conventional popular bands and their legions of fans.

""Virtual idols will move exactly as they are manufactured. And without any unpredictability, they will become something close to video technology, not K-pop,"" said Lee Gyu-tag, an associate professor of cultural studies at George Mason University Korea.

Yet, MAVE:'s creators and entertainment industry officials are upbeat about its potential.

""With so many comments received from all over the world, I've realized that viewers do want something new and that they are rather open-minded,"" said Roh Shi-yong, chief producer of a weekly music show on local TV station MBC that aired MAVE:'s performance twice.

""The metaverse era is coming.""

865,META,2023-02-06,Analysis: Dollar's gyrations raise hedging costs for U.S. companies,"













NEW YORK, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Wild swings in global currencies hammered corporate earnings in the past year, and while forex markets have gotten less choppy, some companies are seeking ways to guard profits and lower hedging costs.

Currency volatility drove the J.P. Morgan VXY G7 Index (.JPMVXYG7) in September to its highest in more than two years. Volatility is still elevated at 10.1, above a 10-year average of 8.34.

Currency gyrations hit corporate behemoths like IBM, which cited FX in reporting a $3.5 billion decrease in its 2022 revenue in fourth quarter earnings, while Facebook parent Meta Platforms said its $32.2 billion revenue last quarter would have been $2 billion higher if not for currency headwinds.

In the third quarter of 2022, North American and European companies reported $47.18 billion in negative currency impacts, 26% steeper than the loss in the previous quarter, according to Kyriba's Quarterly Currency Impact Report released on Tuesday.

""FX Volatility is a critical concern for corporate CEOs and their finance chiefs even as the (dollar) has weakened against... other currencies that US corporates are exposed to,"" Andy Gage, senior vice-president of FX solutions and advisory at Kyriba.

The dollar is down more than 7% against a basket of currencies over the last three months, after rising to a 20-year high in 2022. This may be welcome news for companies looking to regain some of last year's losses, but ""volatility remains especially concerning as organizations finalize year-end reporting and prepare guidance for 2023,"" Gage said.

A strong dollar means income earned overseas for U.S.-based companies is worth less when converted and makes U.S. goods less competitive abroad. Though the dollar has pared its rally, strategists expect more gyrations in currency markets this year, as central banks adjust monetary policies to fight inflation.

Volatility, which causes wider bid-ask spreads and makes hedging more expensive, is causing companies to reassess their hedging programs.

LOOKING FOR OPTIONS

Companies typically use FX forwards to lock in future exchange rates to minimize currency risks, allowing them to agree an exchange rate ahead of time.

As the Federal Reserve aggressively hiked U.S. rates, forward points have increased across many currency pairs containing USD, said Amol Dhargalkar, managing partner and chairman at Chatham Financial.

Refinitiv data shows that price on a three-month EURUSD forward rose to 65.52 in December from 20.61 in January 2022. For the British pound it was 23.77 from -5.70 for the same period.

""There's a psychology and a desire not to lock in lows or highs, depending on which direction you're going on the currency,"" said Dhargalkar.

Some companies are using options to protect against losses caused by exchange rates. This could mean they will benefit if currency fluctuations work in their favor.

Abhishek Sachdev, CEO at Vedanta Hedging in the UK, said 30% more of his mid-market clients are using options than a year ago.

Though most FX options trading happens bilaterally with banks, the volume of listed FX options at CME Group rose 16% year-on-year in 2022, representing an average of more than 42,000 contracts daily or the equivalent of $4.4 billion notional in trading.

Options have their own drawbacks, sources said. Volatility has increased the costs of using options to hedge, creating one hindrance to wider adoption, said Dhargalkar. For instance, implied volatility on a six-months at-the-money EUR/USD option in early December was around 9% versus 6% a year ago, according to Refinitiv data, meaning companies were paying more for the rights that options provide.

SPREADING BETS

Another way businesses are trying to minimize hedging costs is by spreading currency management around to more brokers outside of their main clearing banks, hedging advisors said.

While most currency trading still happens via major banks, third-party firms have grabbed market niches.

Revenue at Argentex Group, a riskless principal broker, has risen 63% from to 2021 as FX volatility elevated corporate hedging needs. MillTechFX, a division of independent currency specialist Millennium Global Group has been doubling its number of clients, pushing up its monthly revenues more than 130% since August.

While currency gyrations have ebbed and hedging costs have declined, “volatility and inflation remain a concern for many companies,” Kyriba’s Gage said.

866,META,2022-06-22,Friday's Russell rebalance may stoke more volatility in nervous stock market,"













NEW YORK, June 22 (Reuters) - Investors in the volatile U.S. stock market are preparing for what may be one of the heaviest trading days of the year on Friday, as FTSE Russell completes the rebalancing of indexes that are tracked by trillions of dollars in investor funds.

FTSE Russell refreshesthe components of its indexes once a year in late June to better reflect broader markets. This spurs fund managers who have benchmarked their performance to the indexes to bring their own portfolios in line with the changes. Some $12 trillion is benchmarked to Russell’s U.S. indexes.

The resulting buying and selling tends to peak at the close of the trading session before the reconstitution is final, and some investors seek to trade on any price dislocations that may result. Total trading volume on the day of the 2021 reconstitution topped 16 billion shares, putting it among last year's busiest sessions.

While past rebalancings have usually gone off without a hitch, some investors said the event is more likely to exacerbate volatility this year, after worries over a more hawkish Federal Reserve have slammed stocks and bonds and ramped up market gyrations in recent weeks. read more

The benchmark S&P 500 has fallen more than 21% year-to-date, as the Fed tightens monetary policy to tame soaring inflation.

“The Federal Reserve is hiking interest rates, we are seeing liquidity dry up and while there is ample cash in the equity market, certainly with negative sentiment it is going to be a tougher story to get that rebalancing done,"" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle.

One of this year’s biggest changes will see Meta Platforms’ (META.O), formerly Facebook, move to the Russell 1000 value index (.RLV), normally the domain of companies perceived to be trading at a discount to their fundamentals. At the same time, energy stocks will receive a greater weighting in the Russell 1000 growth index (.RLG), after a blistering rally over the last year.

Meta's move to the Russell 1000 value index follows a more than 50% tumble in the social media giant's shares this year on company warnings of faltering revenues after a decade of furious growth. read more

The change will cause the weighting of the communication services sector in the Russell 1000 growth index to drop to 8% from 9.9%, while bolstering the sector’s weight in the Russell 1000 value index to 8.7% from 6.9%, according to Jefferies.

Meanwhile, the stellar performance of the energy sector will lead to a heavier weighting of energy shares in the Russell growth indexes (.RLG)(.RUO), Jefferies said.

The energy sector, which has climbed nearly 40% since the last year's reconstitution thanks to a sharp rise in crude prices, will see its weighting increase to 1.7% in the Russell 1000 growth index, from 0.6%.

The move is even more pronounced in the Russell MidCap Growth index (.RMCCG) with energy taking a 5.1% weighting, up from 3.3%.

""Growth managers that have not had to pay attention to energy for several years, now have to pay attention to the sector,"" said Steve DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies in New York.

Given the volume of the trading and number of stocks involved, FTSE Russell takes steps to be transparent regarding the rules for inclusion. This starts in May on its ""rank day,"" which determines the market capitalization bands a stock must be within for inclusion. Subsequent steps include preliminary lists of the additions and deletions from the indexes.

""We don’t want to make unnecessary changes, any methodology changes are thoughtful,” said Catherine Yoshimoto, Director of Product Management for the Russell US Indexes at FTSE Russell. “We are looking at where there may be future improvements but the goal is definitely to keep it stable

Core PCE increases 0.1% in July vs. 0.6% rise in June

Dell, Affirm tumble on weaker forecasts

Indexes down: Dow 3.03%, S&P 3.37%, Nasdaq 3.94%

Lower for the week: Dow 4.2%, S&P 4%, Nasdaq 4.4%















Aug 26 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended Friday with all three benchmarks more than 3% lower, as Federal Reserve Chief Jerome Powell's signal that the central bank would keep hiking rates to tame inflation nixed nascent hopes for a more modest path among some investors.

The Nasdaq led declines among the three U.S. benchmarks, registering its worst daily performance since June 16, weighed by high-growth technology stocks which tumbled after rallying the previous day in anticipation of Powell's scheduled speech to the Jackson Hole central banking conference in Wyoming.

The U.S. economy will need tight monetary policy ""for some time"" before inflation is under control, Powell said at the event. That means slower growth, a weaker job market and ""some pain"" for households and businesses, he added. read more

Investors knew further rate rises were coming, and they have been divided between whether a 75-basis-point and a 50-basis-point hike by the Fed was coming next month.

However, recent data highlighting continued strength in the labor market, to offset two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth, had led to some speculating a more tempered pace of hikes could be forthcoming.

""The pushback is coming from the idea that it's not about the pace of hikes going forward and how they tighten financial conditions, it's about the duration of remaining at that restrictive policy stance,"" said Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers.

""That's the nuance they are trying to push forward and Powell was, maybe, a bit more explicit in that today. But if you've listened to other Fed speakers in the last couple of weeks, it's the same message.""

With investors repositioning after absorbing the speech, the Cboe Volatility Index (.VIX) jumped 3.78 points to 25.56, its highest close in six weeks.

All the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower, led by declines of between 3.9% and 4.3% in the information technology (.SPLRCT), communication services (.SPLRCL) and consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) indexes.

The S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 141.46 points, or 3.37%, to end at 4,057.66 points, while the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) lost 497.56 points, or 3.94%, to 12,141.71. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 1,008.38 points, or 3.03%, to 32,283.40.

High-growth and technology stocks dropped. Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and Amazon.com Inc fell 9.2% and 4.8%, respectively, having led gainers in the previous session. Meanwhile, Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Meta Platforms Inc , and Block Inc (SQ.N) also dipped between 4.1% and 7.7%.

U.S. stock indexes have retreated since the turn of the year as investors priced in the expectation of aggressive interest rate hikes and a slowing economy.

But they have recovered strongly since June, with the S&P 500 recouping nearly half its losses for the year on stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings and hopes decades-high inflation has peaked.

However, Friday's falls wiped out the modest August gains which all three benchmarks had previously carved out, and sent the trio to their second straight week of declines.

For the week, the Nasdaq slid 4.4%, the Dow lost 4.2%, and the S&P 500 fell 4%.

Data earlier showed consumer spending barely rose in July, but inflation eased considerably, which could give the Fed room to trim its aggressive interest rate increases. read more

Affirm Holdings Inc (AFRM.O) tumbled 21.3% after the buy-now-pay-later lender forecast full-year revenue below Wall Street estimates, underscoring the broader downturn in the fortunes of the once high-flying fintech sector.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.37 billion shares, compared with the 10.64 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

NEW YORK, July 28 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks on Thursday rallied for a second day, with all three major indexes ending up more than 1% as data showing a second consecutive quarterly contraction in the economy fueled investor speculation the Federal Reserve may not need to be as aggressive with interest rate hikes as some had feared.

The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes retreated following the data, while utilities (.SPLRCU) and real estate (.SPLRCR) - both of which tend to rise when yields fall - were the day's best-performing S&P 500 sectors.

The decline in yields may suggest ""that markets think the Fed will have to pivot and move rates lower at some point, maybe in the next 12-month period,"" said Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones.

""It does imply the pace of tightening will become more gradual going forward.""

In addition, the growth forecast for second-quarter earnings has risen this week as more S&P 500 companies reported results and beat analyst expectations. Among them, Ford Motor Co (F.N) shares jumped 6.1% after it reported a better-than-expected quarterly net income. read more

The Fed on Wednesday raised the benchmark overnight rate by three-quarters of a percentage point. The move followed a 75 basis points hike last month and smaller moves in May and March, in an effort by the U.S. central bank to tamp down soaring inflation.

NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - A gauge of global stocks fell on Friday to end the trading week on a down note after five straight sessions of gains, while the dollar dipped against a basket of major currencies after soft data on U.S. business activity.

Wall Street posted modest losses in early trading but declines on the S&P 500 accelerated as Big Tech names such as Meta (META.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) lost ground in the wake of earnings from Snap Inc , which plunged 39.08%. Defensive sectors such as utilities (.SPLRCU) and consumer staples (.SPLRCS) were among the few advancers. read more

""Every rally we have had during this bear market, there have been a number of sharp rallies and then they fade and we set new lows and that has been a pretty consistent pattern here,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York.

""Everybody is looking for the turn, everybody is trying to guess at when we get a sustained rally, and everybody is hoping for one, but to me there is still a lot of unknown ahead of us.""

With 106 of the S&P 500 companies having reported earnings through Friday morning, 75.5% have topped analyst expectations, below the 81% beat rate over the past four quarters, according to Refinitiv data.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 137.61 points, or 0.43%, to 31,899.29, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 37.32 points, or 0.93%, to 3,961.63 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 225.50 points, or 1.87%, to 11,834.11.

For the week, the Dow advanced 1.96%, the S&P 500 gained 2.56% and the Nasdaq rose 3.33%. The gains for the Dow and S&P marked their biggest weekly percentage gains in four.

S&P Global on Friday said its preliminary U.S. Composite PMI Output Index had tumbled far more than expected to 47.5 this month from a final reading of 52.3 in June, the first contraction in almost two years. read more

Recent data has showed signs of a slowing economy, but the Federal Reserve is still widely expected to raise U.S. interest rates by 75 basis points at its policy meeting to combat inflation. On Thursday, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised rates by 50 basis points after weeks of indicating a 25 basis point hike was in the offing. read more

The pan-European STOXX 600 index (.STOXX) closed up 0.31% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (.MIWD00000PUS) shed 0.44% after climbing to 623.79, its highest level since June 10.

The MSCI index climbed 3.1% for the week. The STOXX 600 notched in biggest weekly percentage gain in two months, in part due to easing concerns over a potential energy crisis. read more

The dollar lost ground on the heels of the business activity data, as investors weighed slowing economic activity against easing inflation.

The dollar index fell 0.047%, with the euro down 0.18% to $1.021.

The euro slipped in choppy trading after data showed euro zone business activity also unexpectedly contracted this month, with companies continuing to report rising costs as inflation bites, hitting consumer demand and weighing on the outlook, a survey showed. read more

After touching a 20-year high last week, the dollar was on track for its biggest weekly percentage decline in nearly two months.

The Japanese yen strengthened 0.98% versus the greenback at 136.05 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.2002, up 0.08% on the day.

Benchmark 10-year notes last 15.6 basis points to yield 2.7522%, after earlier hitting a two-month low of 2.732%.

""The market is quickly pricing out the possibility of the Fed being able to raise rates aggressively for the remainder of the year,"" said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale in New York.

ECB President Christine Lagarde said in an interview with Germany's Funke Mediengruppe published on Friday that the central bank will raise its interest rates until inflation falls back to its 2% target, her strongest comments to date about combating inflation. read more

U.S. crude settled down 1.71% at $$94.70 per barrel and Brent settled at $103.20, down 0.64% on the day.

Summary Companies Bank of America, BNY benefit from rising interest rates

Growth stocks jump as Treasury yields fall

Goldman Sachs up on report of major business overhaul

Dow up 1.86%, S&P 500 up 2.65%, Nasdaq up 3.43%















NEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks kicked off the trading week on Monday with a rally after Britain reversed course on an economic plan, while Bank of America was the latest financial company to post solid quarterly results, which lifted optimism about the corporate earnings season.

Britain named Jeremy Hunt finance minister, and he immediately dispelled many of Prime Minister Liz Truss' fiscal measures, which had unnerved markets in recent weeks.

Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) shares surged 6.06% as the lender's net interest income was buoyed by rising interest rates in the quarter, even though it added $378 million to its loan-loss reserves to buttress against a softening economy.

Fellow financial Bank of NY Mellon Corp (BK.N) also benefited from higher interest rates, and its shares climbed 5.08%.

Overall, higher rates boosted interest incomes for lenders in the third quarter, giving investors hope the current earnings season will be able to hurdle a lowered bar of expectations. The earnings growth estimate for the quarter is 3%, according to Refinitiv data, down from 4.5% at the start of the month and 11.1% on July 1.

""In a fragile market like this, any type of good news in the margin can go a long way,"" said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management in Boston.

""There is better sentiment around what is happening in the UK, financials earnings are being supported by a number of factors, better net interest margins are one key element, higher rates are going to be good for the banks so Q3 earnings maybe are looking a little less bad than feared, I would put it, maybe not necessarily better than feared.""

The S&P 500 banks index (.SPXBK) was up 3.48%, while each of the 11 major S&P 500 sector were higher.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 550.99 points, or 1.86%, to 30,185.82, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 94.88 points, or 2.65%, to 3,677.95 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 354.41 points, or 3.43%, to 10,675.80.

U.S. equities remain mired in a bear market, after struggling through September, historically a tough month. Analysts said to better stock valuations entering what is traditionally a stronger period for stocks were also supporting Monday's rally. Aggressive Federal Reserve interest rate hikes could be a stumbling block though.

Valuations have come down sharply but still above the 20-year average

""Right now the Fed owns the market, Fed policy is the key driver, they are implementing the most aggressive tightening in the shortest amount of time that we have seen in our generation and it is important to remember that Fed policy, it works with a lag,"" said Roland.

Data on manufacturing in the New York region was weaker than expected, adding fuel to expectations a pivot by the Fed may be on the horizon.

Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS.N), which will post results on Tuesday, advanced 2.24% following reports of a plan to combine its investment banking and trading businesses.

Major megacap growth stocks like Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) all rallied, helping to lift the S&P 500 growth index (.IGX) by 3.42%, its biggest daily percentage jump since July 27.

Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), Netflix (NFLX.O) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) are among companies expected to report results later in the week.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.65 billion shares, compared with the 11.52 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.79-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.98-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 83 new highs and 146 new lows.

871,META,2022-12-06,Morning Bid: Five Alive,"













A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.

With a bit of a lag perhaps after Friday's strong jobs report, markets are realising the U.S. economy is not yet slowing as fast as they had assumed or the Federal Reserve may have wanted.

While dodging recession in 2023 should ostensibly be a good thing for most people, it raises uncomfortable inflation scenarios that question just how high Fed interest rates need to go and how long they stay there. And given that investors are overwhelmingly positioning for peak rates by mid year and Fed rate cuts after that, the 'good news is bad news' reactions re-emerged on Monday.

The latest trigger was surveys showing the U.S. service sector had regained steam in November, with employment there rebounding - much like the robust November payrolls report had indicated on Friday.

With next week's Fed meeting in view, the readout saw the S&P500 (.SPX) record its worst day in almost a month and the (.VIX) 'fear index' of Wall St volatility jumped back from 8-month lows. Futures markets pushed their implied Fed 'terminal rate' next May back above 5% - from as low as 4.85% shortly after Fed Chair Jerome's peculiarly dovish speech last week.

U.S. stock futures and equities in Europe and Asia were flat first thing on Tuesday. The dollar firmed up.

The nightmare scenario for some investors is that the Fed does indeed pause its rate rise campaign next Spring and the economy picks up pace - but inflation fails to return close to target and the central bank is forced to resume tightening later in the year, pushing recession onto 2024's radar too.

With Fed officials in their pre-meeting blackout period, each data point will now be very market sensitive. Tuesday's international trade soundings for October will be scanned for early indications of fourth-quarter GDP.

Even though some assume Europe is already in recession, the incoming German industrial numbers are showing it may be more shallow than many first feared - with its own implications for inflation and interest rates there.

European Central Bank 'doves' struck a more mixed tone this week - with ECB chief economist Philip Lane saying inflation is close to a peak even if more rate rises are needed. Ireland's central bank chief Gabriel Makhlouf reinforced market pricing for downshift in ECB rate rises to a 50 basis point hike next week, but also said rates may need to exceed current terminal rate assumptions of 3%.

Australia's central bank was similarly unaccommodating on Tuesday as it raised interest rates to a 10-year high of 3.1% and stuck with its projection that more hikes are needed to cool inflation - to some surprise in markets.

There was much better news from crude oil markets, where Brent skidded further to below $82.50 as the Russian oil price cap and sanctions came into effect - with the fall from Monday's peak close to 7%. The year-on-year oil price gain, which was almost 100% in April, has retreated back toward 10%.

There were further signs that China's COVID restrictions are being lifted gradually - though that's ambiguous for global inflation outlooks more generally.

There will also be attention later on the U.S. Senate runoff in Georgia - although Democrats have control of the Senate regardless.

In technology, Facebook parent Meta Platforms on Monday threatened to remove news from its platform if the U.S. Congress passes a proposal aimed at making it easier for news organizations to negotiate collectively with companies like Alphabet, Google and Facebook.

Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday:

* US Oct international trade balance, Canada Oct trade balance

* U.S. corporate earnings: Autozone, Toll Brothers, MongoDB

* ECOFIN of EU finance ministers meet in Brussels

* Results from U.S. Senate runoff in Georgia

Surprises still positive

U.S. Fed has missed the mark on inflation

872,META,2022-07-27,Analysis: Investors gauge U.S. stocks rebound: 'suckers' rally' or market bottom?,"













NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - As investors await another jumbo-sized rate increase from the Federal Reserve, they are taking the temperature of a weeks-long U.S. stock market rally that followed a vicious first-half selloff.

Even after Tuesday's sharp fall, the S&P 500 remained up 7% from its June 16 low, buoyed in part by expectations that the Fed will pause its aggressive rate hikes early next year and a recent decline in commodity prices that investors hope will help ease inflation.

So far, the bounce has its share of doubters. Three rallies of comparable magnitude have already wilted this year, with stocks sliding to new lows each time. Blackrock, the world’s largest asset manager, on Monday warned investors that more volatility lay ahead and said it was underweight developed market equities on expectations that inflation will stay tenacious.

""We think this is a bear market suckers' rally,"" said Steve Chiavarone, senior portfolio manager at Federated Hermes, who believes the Fed will remain hawkish longer than expected and has reduced his equity exposure as the S&P pushed higher over the last few weeks.

Expectations that the Fed will end its market-bruising rate hikes sooner than forecast have helped power stocks higher. Nearly two-thirds of investors now believe the Fed funds rate will stand at 3.5% or lower by March 2023, up from just a third a month ago with that view, according to CME. read more

Investors expect the Fed to deliver another 75 basis points of tightening Wednesday, after already raising rates by 150 basis points so far this year. FEDWATCH Hopes for moderation after that could be dashed if consumer prices remain stubbornly high in coming weeks - repeating a scenario that dragged stocks lower this year, Blackrock’s strategists wrote.

""Inflation data could surprise to the upside – and cause markets to rapidly price a higher rate path once again. Result: another equities sell-off,"" BlackRock strategists wrote.

Data from the Wells Fargo Investment Institute showed the severity of the current bear market - which saw the S&P 500 fall as much as 23.6% below its January high - may depend on whether the economy is in a recession. read more

Bear markets accompanied by a recession have lasted an average of 18 months, during which stocks fell an average of 35.8%. Without a recession, bear markets lasted an average of 5.9 months with an average decline of 27.9%, the bank’s data showed.

On Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen acknowledged the risk of a recession but said it was not inevitable. read more Still, parts of the market have continued to reflect investor unease, even as broader averages have bounced.

More stocks have posted new lows than new highs on the Nasdaq Composite Index for 76 straight days, the longest such stretch in 20 years, said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at All Star Charts. The index is up nearly 9% from its June low.

""Until that relationship changes, it's premature to say that a bottom is in place,"" Delwiche said.

More optimistic investors point to an array of signals indicating bearish sentiment may have reached a crescendo in recent weeks, potentially exhausting sellers and making it easier for stocks to rebound.

A fund manager survey from BoFA Global Research last week showed expectations for global growth and profits at all-time lows and cash levels at their highest in two decades, two contrarian indicators the banks' strategists said could indicate greater stock gains ahead.

Short interest in the S&P 500, meanwhile, recently stood at its highest level since the depths of the coronavirus selloff in 2020, a signal that has occurred during past market bottoms, the bank's strategists wrote.

""We think it’s possible that the S&P 500 has already bottomed, and if it hasn’t, will find a bottom during the third quarter,” said Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, in a note to investors.

Calvasina recently added stock exposure, betting that a possible recession has already been baked into prices. read more

Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group, believes this week’s earnings reports - which include results from heavyweights such as Apple Inc and Meta Platforms– could play a key part in determining whether stocks can continue rallying. read more

For the time being, ""the risks to the market are very well known right now"" and already reflected in prices, he said.

Summary Companies Tesla shares plunge on Q4 deliveries miss

Apple marks lowest closing level since June 2021

Indexes down: Dow 0.03%, S&P 0.40%, Nasdaq 0.76%















Jan 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes closed lower on the first trading day of 2023 with the biggest drags from Tesla and Apple, while investors worried about the Federal Reserve's interest-rate hiking path as they awaited minutes from its December meeting.

Shares in electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) closed down 12% after hitting their lowest level since August 2020 and put pressure on the consumer discretionary sector (.SPLRCD) following a miss on Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter deliveries.

Apple Inc (AAPL.O) shares sank 3.7%, with the iPhone maker hitting its lowest level since June 2021, after a report from Nikkei Asia pointed to weaker demand. In addition, an analyst downgraded their rating of the stock due to production cuts in COVID-19-hit China.

The energy sector (.SPNY), which logged stellar gains in 2022, closed down 3.6% in the year's first trading day as oil prices fell on bleak business activity data from China and concerns about the global economic outlook. .

The main U.S. stock indexes in 2022 showed their steepest annual losses since 2008 following the Fed's fastest pace of rate hikes since the 1980s to stamp out decades-high inflation.

""2022 was a terrible year for equity markets. Some of the reasons for that haven't dissipated because we turned the calendar,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. ""There's still elevated anxiety, uncertainty about the Fed and inflation. Until there's clarity on that, it's going to be tough to make any upside headway in equity markets.""

Given Apple and Tesla's clout in the market, James also cited specific concerns about them for broader S&P weakness Tuesday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 10.88 points, or 0.03%, to 33,136.37; the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 15.36 points, or 0.40%, to 3,824.14; and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 79.50 points, or 0.76%, to 10,386.99.

The S&P 500 had shed 19.4% in 2022, marking a roughly $8 trillion decline in market capitalization, while the Nasdaq fell 33.1%, dragged down by growth stocks.

Among the S&P 500's 11 major sectors, behind energy, technology was the second biggest decliner, losing 1%, with Apple hastening the decline as it ended the day with a market valuation below $2 trillion for the first time since March 2021.

Tesla's biggest daily percentage drop since September 2020 helped make the consumer discretionary index (.SPLRCD) the S&P's third weakest sector on the day with a 0.6% drop.

The benchmark's biggest gainer on the day was communications services (.SPLRCL), with Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) leading the advancers there with a gain of 3.7%.

Investors on Wednesday will closely monitor the minutes of the Fed's December policy meeting, when the central bank raised interest rates by 50 basis points after four straight 75 basis points hikes and signaled rates could stay higher for longer.

Other economic data due this week includes the ISM manufacturing report, also on Wednesday, and December's jobs report on Friday.

Weakness in the labor market could give the Fed a reason to ease its monetary policy tightening, but the data so far has shown that market remains tight despite rate hikes.

Money market participants see a 68% chance the Fed will raise the benchmark rate by 25 basis points to 4.50% to 4.75% in February, with the rates peaking at 4.98% by June. .

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.42-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.20-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and five new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 92 new highs and 58 new lows.

On U.S. exchanges 10.618 billion shares changed hands, marking an uptick from the previous week's lower volume due to the holiday season. It compared with the 10.799 billion-share average for the last 20 trading days.

Traders expect 50 bps rate hike in Dec

EV maker Rivian gains on strong demand, outlook

Indexes end: S&P 500 +5.54%, Nasdaq +7.35%, Dow +3.70%















Nov 10 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 (.SPX) and Nasdaq (.IXIC) jumped on Thursday, racking up their biggest daily percentage gains in over 2-1/2 years as a sign of slowing inflation in October sparked speculation the Federal Reserve might become less aggressive with interest rate hikes.

Stocks in sectors across the board surged as the latest consumer price data cheered investors worried that ongoing interest rate hikes could hobble the U.S. economy.

One-time Wall Street darlings tarnished in 2022's bear market were among Thursday's strongest performers, with Nvidia (NVDA.O) jumping about 14%, Meta Platforms (META.O) climbing 10% and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) rising 7.6%.

The Labor Department's data showed the annual CPI number below 8% for the first time in eight months.

""This is a big deal,"" said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco. ""We have been calling the peak of inflation for the last couple of months and just have been incredibly frustrated that it hasn’t shown up in the data. For the first time, it has actually shown up in the data.""

Growing recession worries have hammered Wall Street this year. The S&P 500 (.SPX) remains down about 17% year to date, and it is on course for its biggest annual decline since 2008.

The inflation data prompted traders to adjust rate hike bets, with odds of a 50-basis point rate hike in December, rather than a 75-basis point hike, jumping to about 85% from 52% before the data was released, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan welcomed the most recent inflation data, but warned that the fight with rising prices was far from over.

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) surged more than 12% after the Wall Street Journal reported that the e-commerce heavyweight was reviewing unprofitable business units to cut costs.

S&P 500's busiest trades

The S&P 500 climbed 5.54% to end the session at 3,956.31 points.

The Nasdaq gained 7.35% to 11,114.15 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3.70% to 33,715.37 points.

All 11 S&P 500 sector indexes rallied, led by information technology (.SPLRCT), up 8.33%, followed by a 7.74% gain in real estate (.SPLRCR).

The Philadelphia semiconductor index (.SOX) surged 10.2%, cutting its loss in 2022 to about 32%.

The CBOE volatility index (.VIX), also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, fell to a near two-month low of about 23 points.

Some investors urged caution that Thursday's rally may be overdone.

""The market is - as it has been a few times this year - very eager to trade a 'Fed pivot' ... but we think the market is getting a little ahead of itself based on one print,"" said Zach Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments in Charlotte.

The PHLX Housing index (.HGX) jumped 10.3% to its highest since August after tumbling this year over concerns about higher mortgage rates denting affordability.

Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN.O) surged 17.4% after the electric-vehicle maker reported a smaller-than-expected loss, higher number of pre-orders and reaffirmed its full-year production outlook.

The Dow has now recovered about 17% from its closing low on Sept. 30, and it remains down about 9% from its record high close in early January.

Advancing issues outnumbered falling ones within the S&P 500 (.AD.SPX) by a 26.9-to-one ratio.

The S&P 500 posted 19 new highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 120 new highs and 166 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was heavy, with 14.9 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 11.9 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.

875,META,2022-11-18,Google sets rules for HQ guest speakers after row over Indian historian -emails,"













OAKLAND, Calif., Nov 18 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google this week introduced rules for inviting guest speakers to its offices, days after it canceled a talk by an Indian historian who has disparaged marginalized groups and their concerns, according to company emails seen by Reuters.

The policy released Thursday is Google's latest effort to preserve an open culture while addressing divisions that have emerged as its workforce has grown.

Workers at Google and other big tech companies in recent years have clashed and protested over politics and racial and gender equity. Also, Alphabet, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) all face union organizing drives whose demands include that the companies adopt progressive policies.

The Google speaker rules, seen by Reuters, cite risk to the brand from certain talks and asks workers to ""consider whether there's a business reason for hosting the speaker and if the event directly supports our company goals.""

It calls for avoiding topics that could be ""disruptive or undermine Google's culture of belonging"" and reiterates that speakers are barred from advocacy of political candidates and ballot measures.

""We've always been proud to host external speakers at Google, as they provide great opportunities for learning and connection for our employees,"" Google spokesman Ryan Lamont told Reuters. The updated process will ""ensure these events are useful and contribute to a productive work environment.""

An email introducing the policy to managers said it unifies and clarifies a patchwork of guidelines.

Greater scrutiny threatens the free-flowing, university-like culture Google has prized since its inception. But a workplace viewed as more inviting could attract a more diverse workforce that might help Google develop products with broader appeal.

In recent years, internal disputes spilling into public view led Google to increase content moderation on workplace message boards and cut the frequency of company-wide meetings.

Rivals such as Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) also have policies for inviting speakers.

At Google, speakers have included then-U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama, celebrity chef Ayesha Curry and former basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

RILED UP

Disputes over speakers have roiled Google since at least April, when it said internal rancor prompted it to cancel a talk on India's socioreligious caste system by author Thenmozhi Soundararajan, who advocates for people disadvantaged by caste prejudice.

Members of an internal Hindu group had complained about Soundararajan, describing her rhetoric as inflammatory, a charge she calls bigoted.

At least one of the critics suggested inviting for balance Rajiv Malhotra, according to an internal message. Malhotra, a tech entrepreneur turned self-described contrarian author, has labeled activists such as Soundararajan as ""snakes"" and criticized affirmative action policies that promote lower caste groups.

The Hindu group at Google eventually scheduled Malhotra to speak about India's positive global influence, according to an invitation. But organizers canceled Nov. 10, the day before the planned talk at Google offices in Silicon Valley, according to a follow-up announcement.

Some workers complained to senior management about Malhotra, according to a message soliciting complaints. A linked document organized by Alphabet Workers Union, a labor organization that has been petitioning Google to name caste in its non-discrimination policies, noted Malhotra had described homosexuality as a medical condition and Islam as a destructive force.

Malhotra told Reuters he supports marginalized communities but opposes ""politicizing of bias in ways that divide societies and make them vulnerable to foreign colonization.""

Allowing his speech after canceling Soundararajan's would have amounted to a contradictory standard, according to messages between employees.

The new speaker policy states that workers ""must submit a proposal and have it approved"" by a ""cross-functional"" review team. Requests are due at least 12 weeks before an event.

""Await a response before making contact with the speaker and/or their representative,"" it says. ""Failure to follow this process is a violation of Google policies.""

Jan 5 (Reuters) - Silvergate Capital Corp (SI.N) reported a sharp drop in fourth-quarter crypto-related deposits on Thursday as investors spooked by the collapse of FTX pulled out more than $8 billion in deposits, sending shares down more than 42%.

The crypto-focused bank also said it would cut its workforce by 40%, or about 200 employees, as it tries to rein in costs amid a deepening industry downturn. Its stock was last trading at $12.55.

The dire preliminary earnings report shows the extent of the impact on the digital asset industry from the downfall of crypto exchange FTX, which filed for bankruptcy in November after failing to cover customer withdrawals, marking a stunning reversal of fortunes for what was one of the world's biggest crypto exchanges.

Total deposits from digital asset customers at Silvergate declined to $3.8 billion at the end of December, compared to $11.9 billion at the end of September. The company sold $5.2 billion of debt securities at a loss of $718 million in the fourth quarter to maintain liquidity.

Silvergate had said earlier it had no outstanding loans or investments in FTX, but its shares have shed 69% of their value since the exchange's meltdown, which sparked a wild crypto sell-off.

A U.S. attorney told a bankruptcy court on Wednesday that prosecutors had seized U.S. bank accounts at Silvergate and Farmington State Bank affiliated with FTX's Bahamas-based business, known as FTX Digital Markets.

Court records show the accounts at Silvergate Bank and Farmington State Bank, which does business as Moonstone Bank, held about $143 million.

On Tuesday, FTX founder and former chief executive officer Sam Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to eight criminal counts including wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy. The 30-year-old is accused of looting FTX customers' deposits to support his Alameda Research hedge fund, buy real estate and donate millions of dollars to political causes.

""We are in a period of 'shoot first, ask questions later' for any bad news related to crypto and crypto-related businesses,"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at investment firm Great Hill Capital.

""We expect this carnage to continue for some time as there is no way to value the underlying asset.""

Slowing the expansion of its business, La Jolla, California-based Silvergate is also delaying the launch of a blockchain-based payment solution it had purchased from Meta Platforms Inc-backed Diem Group last year.

The bank said it would take an impairment charge of $196 million in the fourth quarter on assets purchased for the payment solution venture.

Total deposits from digital asset customers at Silvergate declined to $3.8 billion at the end of December, compared to $11.9 billion at the end of September. The company sold $5.2 billion of debt securities at a loss of $718 million in the fourth quarter to maintain liquidity.

Several U.S. lawmakers have questioned the relationship between Silvergate and Bankman-Fried's crypto firms.

In a December letter to Silvergate CEO Alan Lane, Senators Elizabeth Warren, John Kennedy and Roger Marshall expressed concern that Silvergate may have facilitated the transfer of FTX customer funds to Alameda, and requested information on the bank's anti-money laundering compliance program.

In a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, Lane said Silvergate ""absolutely"" follows all know-your-customer and Bank Secrecy Act requirements, which instruct banks to report suspicious activity.

""The misinformation out there is candidly very frustrating,"" Lane said. ""We follow the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act for every account that we open, and we conduct ongoing monitoring.""

Given the reduction in headcount, the impairment charge and ""future potential for regulatory actions as it relates to FTX/Alameda wires, I would imagine Silvergate is definitely exploring strategic options at this point, including a potential merger/sale,"" said Ben McMillan, chief investment officer at IDX Digital Assets.

Silvergate declined to comment on whether it would pursue any strategic options.

On Tuesday, U.S. bank regulators issued a joint statement warning banks of risks associated with cryptocurrency, adding that they had concerns with the safety and soundness of bank business models that are highly concentrated in crypto.

Founded in 1988, Silvergate ventured into crypto in 2013. The bank counts major exchanges like Coinbase Global Inc (COIN.O) and Kraken among its customers.

The bank had also operated a mortgage warehouse business, but announced in December that it would be winding down that division, citing the rising interest rate environment and reduction in mortgage volumes.

877,META,2022-09-23,Global climate change protests demand compensation ahead of COP27,"













BRUSSELS, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Young activists rallied for climate action on Friday, staging protests from New Zealand and Japan to Germany and the Democratic Republic of Congo to demand that rich countries pay for the damage global warming is inflicting upon the poor.

The protests take place six weeks before this year's U.N. climate summit, known as COP27, where vulnerable countries will push for compensation for climate-related destruction to homes, infrastructure and livelihoods.

Demonstrations were planned in around 450 locations worldwide by youth movement Fridays for Future. They are timed to coincide with global leaders meeting in New York City at the U.N. General Assembly this week.

""One day, it could be my house that gets flooded,"" said 15-year-old Park Chae-yun, one of around 200 people protesting in Seoul, South Korea. ""I'm living with a sense of crisis, so I think it is more important to deliver my concerns to the government to take preventive measures rather than going to school.""

A protester who gave their name as Meta had the same worry in Indonesia: ""If Jakarta is flooded, everyone who has money can leave. Where do I go? I will drown here in Jakarta.""

Around 400 young activists gathered in the Democratic Republic of Congo's capital Kinshasa, chanting slogans such as ""Act for Africa, protect our planet"" and carrying cardboard signs reading ""Climate Justice"" and ""Climate SOS"" while walking on the shoulder of a busy thoroughfare.

In New York, at least 2,000 people gathered Friday afternoon for the march, chanting slogans such as, ""the people united, shall never be defeated,"" as they went from Foley Square to lower Manhattan.

Shortly before 3 p.m. (1800 GMT), the crowd started gathering in Wall Streets' financial district in front of the famous bull statue, which has come to symbolize the stock market and big business.

Citing the catastrophic flooding in Pakistan that displaced millions of people this year, one speaker told the crowd, ""The rains came from the sky but the floods came from the greed in America and your leaders addiction to oil.""

Nemonte Nenquimo, an indigenous leader from the Pastaza region in Ecuador's Amazon, spoke to the crowd, ""I am here to make visible our battle throughout the Amazon ... We (have given) our lives to protect the planet.""

'DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES'

Irreparable damage caused by climate change has heightened developing countries' demands for ""Loss & Damage"" compensation at COP27 in Egypt in November.

Leaders from these countries note the world is already facing climate-fuelled disasters, including deadly floods engulfing large parts of Pakistan, wildfires ravaging Morocco and Canada and record-breaking heatwaves in Britain and India.

""The Least Developed Countries are bearing the brunt of the devastating consequences of climate change,"" Senegal's environment minister Abdou Karim Sall told a meeting in Dakar last week.

""The fundamental priority is to ensure new and additional funding to deal with it,"" he said.

The United States and 27-country European Union have historically resisted steps that could require rich nations to pay compensation for causing climate change.

But pressure is mounting on global institutions to stop funding fossil fuel industries.

A top climate adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday said the head of the World Bank should ""not mince words"" on the scientific consensus on climate change after its president, David Malpass, this week tried to dodge a question about whether fossil fuels were dangerously warming the planet.

Malpass later clarified he was not a climate change denier, after facing a flurry of calls to resign.

The COP27 meeting in Sharm El Sheikh is not expected to yield a landmark deal like the one struck at the COP26 summit last November in Glasgow, which asked countries to do much more to curb planet-warming carbon emissions.

But it will be a litmus test for countries' willingness to cooperate on climate action, despite the fractious geopolitical backdrop, as many governments scramble to tame soaring inflation and grapple with the upheaval in energy markets caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

878,META,2022-08-11,Google opposes Facebook-backed proposal for self-regulatory body in India -sources,"Summary

Summary Companies India wants a panel to review complaints about content decisions

New Delhi is open to tech firms forming their own review system

Google says self-regulatory system sets bad precedent -sources















NEW DELHI, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Google has grave reservations about developing a self-regulatory body for the social media sector in India to hear user complaints, though the proposal has support from Facebook and Twitter (TWTR.N), sources with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters.

India in June proposed appointing a government panel to hear complaints from users about content moderation decisions, but has also said it is open to the idea of a self-regulatory body if the industry is willing.

The lack of consensus among the tech giants, however, increases the likelihood of a government panel being formed - a prospect that Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) Facebook and Twitter are keen to avoid as they fear government and regulatory overreach in India, the sources said.

At a closed-door meeting this week, an executive from Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google told other attendees the company was unconvinced about the merits of a self-regulatory body. The body would mean external reviews of decisions that could force Google to reinstate content, even if it violated Google's internal policies, the executive was quoted as saying.

Such directives from a self-regulatory body could set a dangerous precedent, the sources also quoted the Google executive as saying.

The sources declined to be identified as the discussions were private.

In addition to Facebook, Twitter and Google, representatives from Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and popular Indian social media platform ShareChat also attended the meeting. Together, the companies have hundreds of millions of users in India.

Snap and ShareChat also voiced concern about a self-regulatory system, saying the matter requires much more consultation including with civil society, the sources said.

Google said in a statement it had attended a preliminary meeting and is engaging with the industry and the government, adding that it was ""exploring all options"" for a ""best possible solution.""

ShareChat and Facebook declined to comment. The other companies did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.

THORNY ISSUE

Self-regulatory bodies to police content in the social media sector are rare, though there have been instances of cooperation. In New Zealand, big tech companies have signed a code of practice aimed at reducing harmful content online. read more

Tension over social media content decisions has been a particularly thorny issue in India. Social media companies often receive takedown requests from the government or remove content proactively. Google's YouTube, for example, removed 1.2 million videos in the first quarter of this year that were in violation of its guidelines, the highest in any country in the world.

India's government is concerned that users upset with decisions to have their content taken down do not have a proper system to appeal those decisions and that their only legal recourse is to go to court.

Twitter has faced backlash after it blocked accounts of influential Indians, including politicians, citing violation of its policies. Twitter also locked horns with the Indian government last year when it declined to comply fully with orders to take down accounts the government said spread misinformation. read more

An initial draft of the proposal for the self-regulatory body said the panel would have a retired judge or an experienced person from the field of technology as chairperson, as well as six other individuals, including some senior executives at social media companies.

The panel's decisions would be ""binding in nature"", stated the draft, which was seen by Reuters.

Western tech giants have for years been at odds with the Indian government, arguing that strict regulations are hurting their business and investment plans. The disagreements have also strained trade ties between New Delhi and Washington.

U.S. industry lobby groups representing the tech giants believe a government-appointed review panel raises concern about how it could act independently if New Delhi controls who sits on it. read more

The proposal for a government panel was open to public consultation until early July. No fixed date for implementation has been set.

Summary Companies Fed's Powell says 50 bps rate hike 'on the table'

United Airlines, American Airlines jump on earnings outlook

Tesla rises after first-quarter results top estimates

Markets give up early-day gains to end lower

Indexes down: Dow 1.05%, S&P 1.48%, Nasdaq 2.07%















April 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street's ended lower on Thursday, with the Nasdaq dropping more than 2%, as investors reacted to Federal Reserve officials including Chair Jerome Powell offering further signposting of aggressive interest rate hikes this year.

A half-point interest rate increase will be ""on the table"" when the U.S. central bank meets on May 3-4 to approve the next in what is expected to be a series of rate increases this year, Powell said.

With inflation running roughly three times the Fed's 2% target, ""it is appropriate to be moving a little more quickly,"" Powell added in a discussion of the global economy at the meetings of the International Monetary Fund. read more

""The market is pricing in, at least, 50 basis points in May and June,"" said George Catrambone, head of trading at DWS Group.

""Powell, and many other Fed speakers, have been saying they want to get to control as quickly as possible, and that is saying to the market that they are going to go aggressively.""

Earlier on Thursday, San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly said she supports raising the U.S. central bank's target for overnight borrowing costs to 2.5% by the end of this year, but whether or how much further it will need to rise will depend on what happens with inflation and labor markets. read more

The remarks by Fed officials hijacked initial momentum which the markets received from positive earnings. All three major indexes opened higher, boosted by strong results from heavyweight Tesla (TSLA.O) and airline operators.

However, gains were eroded through the morning session and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq had already reversed course by the time Powell spoke.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 368.03 points, or 1.05%, to 34,792.76, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 65.79 points, or 1.48%, to 4,393.66 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 278.41 points, or 2.07%, to 13,174.65.

Bond yields also breached fresh multi-year peaks. Yields on the two-year U.S. Treasury, the most sensitive to interest changes, hit their highest in three years before coming off slightly.

High-growth stocks, including those of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), fell as investors fretted about how the higher rate environment would impact their future growth potential. Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) declined 6.2%, taking its losses in the last two days to 13.5%.

Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) slumped 3.5%, taking its market capitalization below the $100 billion mark for the first time since January 2018. It was the second day of declines for the streaming giant after its quarterly earnings revealed a first drop in subscriber numbers in a decade, with further falls likely. read more

The forecast prompted William Ackman to liquidate a $1.1 billion bet on Netflix, with the billionaire investor writing the firm's future was too uncertain to hold onto his position. read more

The 1.7% fall in the broader technology index (.SPLRCT) was one of the worst among the sectors, with all 11 major industries ending lower. Energy (.SPNY) was hit the hardest, despite crude prices gaining.

Alcoa Corp (AA.N) was another to slide after posting results. The aluminum producer tumbled 16.9%, its biggest fall since March 2020, as the Russia-Ukraine conflict impacted its business.

There were some bright spots though. Tesla, the world's most valuable automaker, rose 3.2% after its results beat Wall Street expectations as higher prices helped it overcome supply-chain chaos and rising costs. read more

Airline stocks also maintained their recent momentum. United Airlines Holdings Inc (UAL.O) and American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O)climbed 9.3% and 3.8%, respectively, after they predicted a return to profit in the current quarter due to booming travel demand. read more

The volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.27 billion shares, compared with the 11.65 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

The S&P 500 posted 78 new 52-week highs and 16 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 73 new highs and 367 new lows.

NEW YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - As U.S. companies open their books on the second quarter in the coming weeks, investors increasingly worried about a recession will be anxious to hear what executives say about how demand is holding up in the face of higher costs.

Concerns over a possible recession have already driven a sharp selloff in stocks that resulted in the S&P 500's (.SPX) steepest percentage drop in the first-half of a year since 1970.

But earnings forecasts for the year have largely held up. That has raised questions among some investors about whether current earnings projections reflect those concerns and can remain strong enough to support the market.

Investors have been trying to to figure out whether an aggressive interest rate hike cycle by the U.S. Federal Reserve to tame inflation could tip the economy into recession.

With recession talk having increased in the market, upcoming corporate results and outlooks ""are going to be the key catalyst going forward,"" said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates in Toledo, Ohio.

Earnings from some of Wall Street's biggest banks will unofficially start off the earnings period when they report next week, with results from JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) due Thursday.

For the second quarter, analysts expect overall S&P 500 earnings to have increased 5.7% over the year-ago period, compared to growth of 6.8% expected at the start of April, while they see earnings for all of 2022 growing by 9.4% versus 8.8% expected on April 1, according to IBES data from Refinitiv as of Friday.

Those forecasts, however, are somewhat distorted by the energy sector, whose earnings are forecast to have jumped by more than 230% in the second quarter following a rally in oil prices. Without energy companies, second-quarter profits are expected to have declined 3% from a year ago, based on Refinitiv data.

""While companies may be able to deliver a decent second quarter, the outlooks are likely to be overall very conservative,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York.

Last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told a European Central Bank conference that ""there is a risk"" the U.S. central bank could slow the economy more than needed to control inflation.

Commodity and other costs have been rising, and companies have been grappling with how much of those price increases can be passed on to consumers or absorbed.

Among companies that have already reported, Micron Technology Inc (MU.O) recently projected a fall in current-quarter revenue, sparking concerns about demand in the chip industry. read more

Nike Inc (NKE.N) forecast quarterly revenue below estimates as it expects to discount more. read more

Technology and growth stocks, whose valuations rely more heavily on future cash flows, have been among the hardest hit by concerns over rising rates.

Meta Platforms (META.O) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg recently told employees to brace for a deep economic downturn. read more Its shares fell 27% in the second quarter.

Apple (AAPL.O), whose shares slid about 22% in the second quarter, is due to report results July 28, while results for Alphabet (GOOGL.O), whose shares also dropped 22% last quarter, are expected July 26.

While higher energy prices are expected to be a drag on airlines and other transportation companies as well as some industrial firms, they are a positive for energy names. Chevron (CVX.N) is due to report on July 29.

Goldman Sachs' brokerage recently trimmed its estimates for someconsumer-exposed companies including Apple, citing demand concerns.

Valuations have fallen with the market's selloff. The S&P 500's forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio was at 16.2 as of Friday versus 22.1 at the end of December and was in line with its long-term average of about 16, Refinitiv data showed.

While the drop has made valuations seem more attractive to some investors, others worry about what's in store for earnings forecasts.

Market sentiment already has become more bearish and multiples have come down, said Matt Stucky, senior portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company. ""The next shoe to drop typically is a revision lower in terms of earnings estimates by the sell side.""

881,META,2022-11-21,Disney brings back Bob Iger as CEO in surprise move to boost growth,"Summary

Summary Companies Iger comes out of retirement to serve as CEO for two years

Outgoing CEO Chapek's tenure hit by pandemic

Disney+ streaming business struggling

Disney under pressure from activist investors















LOS ANGELES, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Bob Iger is returning to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) as chief executive less than a year after he retired, a surprise comeback that coincides with the entertainment company's attempt to boost investor confidence and profits at its streaming media unit.

Iger, 71, who was chief executive for 15 years and retired as chairman last year, has agreed to serve as CEO for two more years effective immediately, Disney said in a statement late on Sunday. He will replace Bob Chapek, who took over as Disney CEO in February 2020 just as the COVID-19 pandemic led to park closures and visitor restrictions.

Shares rose Monday to close at $97.58, up 6.3%.

""Maybe the old hand on the tiller is what's required,"" said Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson. Disney has been spending billions of dollars to compete with rival Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and is seeking to revive its share price.

The stock had sunk more than 40% so far this year, lagging the nearly 7% year-to-date drop in the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI). It lost almost a third of its value while Chapek was at the helm.

""The Board has concluded that as Disney embarks on an increasingly complex period of industry transformation, Bob Iger is uniquely situated to lead the Company through this pivotal period,"" Chairwoman Susan Arnold said in the statement.

Disney disappointed investors this month with an earnings report that showed mounting losses at its streaming media unit that includes Disney+. Shares hit a 20-year low the day after the fourth-quarter earnings. read more

The streaming business lost nearly $1.5 billion in the quarter, more than twice the previous year's loss, overshadowing subscriber gains. The unit has yet to turn a profit since its 2019 launch, and Disney has said it expects Disney+ to become profitable in fiscal 2024.

""I am an optimist, and if I learned one thing from my years at Disney, it is that even in the face of uncertainty - perhaps especially in the face of uncertainty - our employees and Cast Members achieve the impossible,"" Iger said in a memo to employees seen by Reuters.

SHAREHOLDER PRESSURE

Some activist investors have mounted pressure on Disney this year, including Third Point, led by billionaire Daniel Loeb.

[1/2] Executive Chairman of the Walt Disney Company, Bob Iger arrives at the world premiere for the film 'The King's Man' at Leicester Square in London, Britain December 6, 2021. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo 1 2

In August, Loeb began pushing for changes, including spinning off the ESPN sports television network and accelerating the planned takeover of Hulu from minority-owner Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O). The investor later tweeted that he better understood ESPN's value to Disney. Third Point also pushed Disney to refresh its board and reached a settlement with the company in September that handed a seat to former Meta executive Carolyn Everson.

In the days following its lackluster earnings report, Trian Fund Management LP, co-founded by Nelson Peltz, bought more than $800 million worth of Disney stock, according to a source familiar with the matter. The WSJ first reported Trian's stake.

Trian's view is that Iger should not be back in control of the company, the source said, adding that Trian has signaled interest in a board seat as it pushes the entertainment giant to make operational improvements and cut costs.

The stake, which is under the 5% disclosure threshold, is not as large as Trian would like it to be and will likely grow subject to market conditions, the WSJ reported.

Disney did not respond to a request for comment on Trian and Trian did not respond to a request for comment.

IGER'S RETURNS

Iger exited Disney on a high note as the company led the battle against Netflix in the streaming wars. During his tenure, Disney made several key acquisitions, including Pixar Animation Studios, Marvel Entertainment and 21st Century Fox, and boosted its market capitalization five-fold.

During his first tenure, Disney's annualized shareholder returns were more than 14%, well above its rival Comcast and the broader stock market.

During this second tour, Iger has been charged with ""setting Disney on a path to renewed growth"" and working with the board to identify a successor, the company said.

The leadership change caught employees by surprise, two company sources said.

Shortly after Iger's return was announced, Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings tweeted: ""Ugh. I had been hoping Iger would run for President. He is amazing.""

882,META,2022-12-08,U.S. dollar likely to remain strong in 2023 amid recession fears,"













NEW YORK, Dec 8 (Reuters) - A breathtaking surge in the U.S. dollar trampled foreign currencies, gouged corporate profits and gave investors one of the year’s few winning trades. Though the greenback has stumbled in recent weeks, recession worries may keep it elevated in 2023.

At its September peak, the dollar stood at its highest level in nearly two decades after rising some 20% against a basket of currencies. Those year-to-date gains have been roughly cut in half as investors bet the Federal Reserve is closer to slowing the pace of the rate increases that helped fuel the dollar's gains.

Reuters Graphics

While rising U.S. yields were a key catalyst for the dollar’s rally, other factors played an important part in boosting the buck. Investors flocked to the dollar — a popular destination during uncertain times — to shelter from market volatility spurred by surging global inflation, spiking energy prices and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Also heightening the dollar’s allure was the comparative strength of the U.S. economy during a time when fears of an energy crisis hammered European assets while stringent COVID-19 controls hurt China's growth.

Even after paring some of its gains, the dollar is still on track for its best year since 2014. Fund managers surveyed by BoFA Global Research named it the market's most crowded trade for the fifth straight month in November and a record number of survey participants said the currency was overvalued.

Still, a Reuters poll of 66 foreign exchange strategists suggested the dollar will trade at its current level around a year from now, with many expecting global central bank policy tightening to hurt growth and boost the greenback’s safe-haven appeal once again.

WHY IT MATTERS

Getting the dollar right is key for investors, as its trajectory sways everything from corporate earnings to the prices of raw materials such as oil and gold.

A stronger dollar makes U.S. exporters' products less competitive abroad while hurting U.S. multinationals that need to exchange their earnings into dollars. The S&P 500's foreign exposure stands at around 30%, according to Bank of America, with the technology and materials sectors most vulnerable.

Nike (NKE.N), IBM (IBM.N) and Meta Platforms (META.O) were among the broad range of companies that warned of a hit from a stronger dollar this year. The dollar's rally shaved about 8% from S&P earnings in 2022, according to Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors.

For the rest of the world, a stronger U.S. currency pressures the price of oil and other dollar-denominated commodities by making them more expensive to foreign buyers, while also making it more expensive for foreign companies and governments that have borrowed in dollars to service their debt.

And while a strong greenback can tamp down U.S. consumer prices, it also pushes down the currencies of other countries, helping exacerbate inflation around the globe. On average, the estimated pass-through of a 10% dollar appreciation into inflation is 1%, the International Monetary Fund estimated in October.

WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR 2023?

There are signs that Wall Street’s sentiment on the dollar may be shifting. Data showing that consumer prices fell less than expected in October helped fuel a 5% fall in the dollar against a basket of currencies last month, its biggest monthly decline since 2010.

In futures markets, speculative traders swung to a net short position on the U.S. dollar for the first time in 16 months in November, calculations by Reuters based on U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed.

Whether the dollar's decline continues may depend on the Fed's ability to contain inflation enough to eventually ease monetary policy. Another benign inflation reading in U.S. data due next week could bolster the case for further dollar declines.

Investors are also awaiting the Dec. 14 conclusion of the Fed's monetary policy meeting, at which the central bank is broadly expected to slow the pace of rate hikes by delivering a 50 basis point increase.

Longer term, economic worries may take over as a driver of dollar moves. Nearly 80% of strategists polled by Reuters said there was little scope for dollar upside based on monetary policy.

All three major U.S. stock indexes gained momentum throughout the first session of a week jam-packed with high profile corporate earnings and crucial economic data.

A report from S&P Global showed a contraction in business activity this month, offering a hint that the Federal Reserve's barrage of steep interest rate hikes are having their desired effect, raising hopes that the central bank could begin slowing the pace of increases to the Fed funds target rate.

""It’s a sign the economy is slowing down and what the Fed is doing is working,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""They may be achieving their goal and we might be approaching the fourth quarter of rate hikes, to use an football analogy.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 417.06 points, or 1.34%, to 31,499.62, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 44.59 points, or 1.19%, to 3,797.34 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 92.90 points, or 0.86%, to 10,952.61.

Among the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, nine closed green, with healthcare (.SPXHC) enjoying the largest percentage gain. Materials (.SPLRCM) and real estate (.SPLRCR) ended the session in negative territory.

Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) shares slid 1.5% after the electric automaker cut prices for its Model 3 and Model Y cars by as much as 9% in China, signaling softening demand in the world's largest auto market.

U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies such as Pinduoduo (PDD.O), JD.com and Baidu Inc plunged between 12% and 25% as President Xi Jinping introduced the new Politburo Standing Committee stacked with loyalists.

""The news coming out of China makes you think there’s going to be a firmer if not antagonistic China in our future,"" Tuz added. ""But it’s too early to see how it’s going to play out as far as where you invest in the future.""

Third quarter earnings season shifts into overdrive this week. So far, nearly one-fifth of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported. Of those, 74.7% have delivered consensus-beating results, according to Refinitiv data.

Analysts expect S&P 500 earnings growth of 3.0%, on aggregate, down from 4.5% at the beginning of the month, per Refinitiv.

Results from a slew of heavy-hitting tech and tech-adjacent companies are likely to dominate the earnings chatter this week.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) following on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) step up to the plate, with Amazon.com (AMZN.O) wrapping up the FAANGs on Thursday.

High-rolling industrials are also expected to post earnings this week, including United Parcel Service (UPS.N), Boeing Co (BA.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N), 3M Co (MMM.N), General Motors Co (GM.N), Chevron (CVX.N) and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N).

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.36-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 21 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 73 new highs and 331 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.80 billion shares, compared with the 11.56 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.

A massive week for top technology firms worldwide pits U.S. mega cap earnings against the withering slide in China tech shares amid domestic political and economic fears.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) report earnings after the bell on Tuesday, with Apple, Meta and Amazon completing updates later in the week from the group of five huge tech companies that collectively make up a fifth of the market cap of the S&P500.

Microsoft is set to post its slowest quarterly revenue growth in over five years, with some doubts about its outlook in the face of PC market slowdowns and a strong dollar. read more

But the decimation of Chinese tech stocks (.HSTECH) this week was more worrying. There was no bounce in Hong Kong stocks on Tuesday after they plunged more than 6% in the previous session as President Xi Jinping introduced the new Politburo Standing Committee stacked with loyalists.

China's yuan also extended its decline to a near 15-year low as Chinese assets continued to slide amid investor concerns about Beijing's policy direction, forcing the country's foreign exchange regulator to survey banks about their positioning in the currency market. read more

U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies such as Pinduoduo (PDD.O), JD.com and Baidu Inc plunged between 12% and 25% in New York on Monday. And JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon said on Tuesday that fractious geopolitics right now were even more concerning than a possibility of a U.S. recession. read more

Gloomy soundings about China's economy also weighed, with high-frequency readouts on travel, shipping, consumption and commerce in the world's second-largest economy showing an early speed bump in the fourth quarter as COVID curbs bite. read more

HSBC's shares fell almost 7% in London, meantime, as investors digested a sudden management change and rising bad loan charges. read more HSBC (HSBA.L) named Georges Elhedery as its new chief financial officer on Tuesday in a surprise shift that puts the former head of its investment bank in pole position to eventually succeed Noel Quinn as chief executive.

The change came as HSBC reported a 42% slide in third quarter profit, hit by loan losses and charges from the sale of its French business as it seeks to placate investors including its largest, China's Ping An Insurance Group .

The move contrasted with the 5% surge in UBS shares (UBSG.S) after the Swiss bank logged a smaller-than-expected 24% slide in quarterly net profit amid robust client inflows, lower costs and financial trading that helped offset a hit to investment banking from this year's market volatility. read more

Some calm returns to British markets more generally as former finance minister Rishi Sunak becomes British prime minister on Tuesday and sets about tackling a mounting economic problems with a new cabinet and a fresh budget plan on Oct 31. read more

Long-dated UK government bond yields at the center of the firestorm caused by last month's botched mini-budget have almost returned to where they were before the release of the fiscal plan on Sept. 23. , The expected peak Bank of England interest rate next year slipped back below 5%.

As investors awaited the European Central Bank's latest interest rate rise on Thursday, German business readings were above forecast for October. But Germany's Ifo research institute said it saw a 'winter recession' coming and the ECB's latest survey showed euro zone banks expect to tighten access to credit further in the fourth quarter. read more

Summary

Summary Companies Russian tech giants Yandex, VK agree to swap some assets

Yandex sells news feed, homepage to state-controlled VK

Yandex gets food delivery service Delivery Club in return

This content was produced in Russia where the law restricts coverage of Russian military operations in Ukraine















MOSCOW, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The Russian government tightened its grip on the internet on Tuesday, as a state-controlled company with close links to President Vladimir Putin agreed to buy the news feed and homepage of the country's most popular website.

Yandex (YNDX.O), often referred to as Russia's Google, said it was selling its news aggregator, content platform Zen and yandex.ru homepage to VK to focus on other business areas, such as food delivery and ride-hailing.

In exchange, Yandex will acquire food delivery company Delivery Club from VK. Values for the assets were not disclosed.

VK runs Russia's largest social network, VKontakte, and an overhaul last year saw state-controlled gas exporter Gazprom and banker Yuri Kovalchuk, whom Putin has publicly called a personal friend, assume greater control over the company.

Vladimir Kiriyenko, the son of Putin's first deputy chief of staff Sergei Kiriyenko, is its CEO.

Russia's years-long suppression of independent media intensified after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24. It passed a law banning what it calls ""false information"" about the armed forces and quashing many organisations' ability to broadcast freely.

It has blocked access to some foreign platforms, including Meta Platforms' (META.O) Facebook and Instagram.

""The board and management of Yandex have concluded that the interests of the company's stakeholders ... are best served by pursuing the strategic exit from its media businesses and shifting to a focus on other technologies and services,"" Yandex said in a statement.

Yandex has, like many Russian companies, had a turbulent few months. It plunged to a first-quarter loss and its shares tumbled to six-year lows before trading was suspended in late February. Revenues and profits recovered in the second quarter, and while its Nasdaq-listed shares remain suspended, trading in its Moscow shares resumed after about a month. read more

'BUYING OUR FREEDOM'

Yandex has in recent years complied with Moscow's demands, under threat of fines, over which publications' stories can feature on its news aggregator, drawing criticism from free-speech advocates.

Moscow has not blocked access to most foreign-language media, which remain freely available in Russia and on Yandex, but search results do restrict access to any sites that communications regulator Roskomnadzor has banned, many of which are Russian-language independent media.

In February, Yandex started warning Russian users seeking information about events in Ukraine of unreliable information online. read more

A former head of Yandex News, Lev Gershenzon, on March 1 described Yandex as a key element in hiding information about the conflict in Ukraine. Yandex has denied being complicit in censorship.

""We are buying our freedom,"" a source close to Yandex said. ""This business had been such a weight on our feet.

""This will enable us to do our business significantly depoliticised, practically completely depoliticised.""

ONLINE SEARCH

Yandex dominates Russia's online search market with a share of around 62%, according to its analytics tool Yandex Radar. Google accounts for about 36%, with VK's mail.ru at less than 1%.

That stronghold over the online search market will likely continue.

Yandex.ru displays a bundle of news stories below its search bar, followed by a rolling stream of content. The company's entry point for search will now become ya.ru, a site that resembles Google's homepage and is already popular with those who prefer uncluttered searches.

Yandex.ru, its News feed and Zen, will be renamed dzen.ru, Yandex said, with VK to take over development and control over ""content, look and feel"". read more

The asset swaps require anti-monopoly approval and are expected to close in the coming months, Yandex said.

E-COMMERCE SHAKE-UP

Search, advertising and ride-hailing are among Yandex's strongest revenue-generating businesses, but it has several other units, such as cloud services and self-driving cars. It is expanding services in Africa and Latin America, but pulling back from e-grocery in Europe. read more

The terms of the deal look broadly neutral, said BCS Express in a note. The profitable Zen and News divisions are positive for VK, while Yandex strengthens its position in foodtech with the likely loss-making Delivery Club, analysts said.

Yandex's Moscow-listed shares rose 2.7%, while VK's depositary receipts were up 2.9%, both outperforming the wider market.

Dmitry Masyuk, head of Yandex's foodtech division, said Delivery Club would improve speed and choice on its food delivery offering. Yandex estimated the size of the market at 650 billion roubles ($11 billion) in 2021 and sees annual growth of 20%, he said.

($1 = 59.7500 roubles)

886,META,2023-02-10,"Recession alarm bells are ringing, but (much) less loudly than before","













Feb 10 (Reuters) - The rapid reopening of China's economy, plunging European gas prices and cooling U.S. inflation suggest a global recession may not be as deep and protracted as feared just weeks ago.

Yes, warning signals are still flashing as last year's surge in inflation and interest rates bites, but a strong rally in world markets suggest optimism is returning.

The International Monetary Fund raised its 2023 global growth outlook and a painful euro area recession that was once seen as all-but-certain is less of a concern. Citi sees a 30% chance of a global recession this year, down from 50% in the second half of last year.

""The earlier worries of a recession being baked into the cake have been dialled back and that is positive for risky assets,"" said Rabobank's head of rates strategy Richard McGuire.

Here's what some closely-watched market indicators say about recession risks.

1/ GOLDILOCKS

MSCI's World Stock Index is up 8% so far this year (.MIWD00000PUS) and the risk premium on junk bonds, or sub-investment grade debt, is at its lowest since the second quarter of 2022.

That's propelled by the so-called Goldilocks view that the global economy will cool just enough to quell inflation, but not so much that earnings will collapse.

Corporate earnings are expected to improve from last year's low base as inflation recedes.

Excluding volatile energy companies, MSCI world-listed companies' earnings per share growth is expected to rise to 4.2% this year, from 1.8% expected for 2022, according to Barclays, then to 9.3% in 2024.

But rallying stocks do not mean the world will escape a recession, rather that China's post-COVID economic reopening should limit the downturn. MSCI's index is still down 14% from its January 2022 peak.

Reuters Graphics

2/ LAYOFFS

Some of the world's largest companies including Meta, IBM and Amazon are cutting thousands of jobs.

But many of the layoffs are from beaten down tech firms that hired aggressively during the pandemic, Goldman Sachs economist Ronnie Walker notes.

""These characteristics suggest that the companies conducting layoffs are not representative of the broader economy,"" Walker said.

Indeed, U.S. jobs growth accelerated sharply in January while the unemployment rate hit its lowest in more than 53 years. Job creation in 2022 was also much stronger than previously estimated, prompting hawkish comments from Fed chair Jerome Powell.

Yoruk Bahceli

3/ DR. COPPER

Dubbed ""Dr Copper"" for its track record as a boom-bust indicator, the metal is up around 8% this year to around $9,005 a tonne as China's economy re-opens .

Copper has also seen its price ratio to gold rise sharply from January's three-month lows. If investors buy copper and dump gold, they are not too alarmed about the outlook.

But copper prices have pulled back recently, reflecting some caution as investors reassess expectations for the speed and scale of China's rebound.

Dr. Copper

4/ HARD DATA, SOFT DATA

Euro zone business activity made a surprise return to growth in January and Chinese growth has slowed less than expected.

Global data is delivering positive surprises at the highest rate since May, Citi's index shows (.CESIGL)

Most economists still expect a U.S. recession, but businesses and some banks have cut the probability of one.

Others note that future growth indicators such as manufacturing activity, housing market data and consumer confidence remain bleak.

""A lot of leading indicators and surveys look quite abysmal at face value, although many of them are stabilizing or even bouncing back,"" said Patrick Saner, head of macro strategy at Swiss Re. ""In the context of inflation, though, core services is what matters and that is underpinned by a still very strong labor market that isn't showing many signs of slowing.""

Reuters Graphics

5/ OUTLIER

Not everyone shares the rosy view, with bond markets still braced for recession.

U.S., German and other government bond yield curves are deeply inverted, meaning short-dated borrowing costs are much higher than long-dated ones.

Historically, that's been a reliable sign that recession is coming. Both the two-year/10-year and the three-month/10-year yield curves are at their most inverted since the early 1980s.

Traders, meanwhile, bet the Fed will hike rates to 5%-5.25% then deliver at least one rate cut by year-end.

And economists polled by Reuters forecast global growth would barely clear 2% this year, a level associated with significant downturns historically, and flagged the risk that it could be even slower.

A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan

Hyperventilating world markets have finally caught their breath as the U.S. bank shock of the past week appeared to calm somewhat and gyrating interest rates found a level.

But volatility is likely to persist (.VIX), <>MOVE> - not least in pre-meeting blackout periods for major central banks - as easing financial system tensions merely re-introduce rate hike risks that sticky US inflation readings seem to warrant.

And with longer-running global banking sagas exposed by the events of the past week, nerves were jangled again on Wednesday as Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) shares dropped by as much as 10.5% to a new record low, as its largest investor said it couldn't give the Swiss bank more financial assistance.

After bank stocks rebounded somewhat on Tuesday, despite Moody's downgrading the credit outlook for the entire U.S. banking system, attention turned to tighter regulation and workouts for the worst affected firms.

The Federal Reserve is considering tougher rules and oversight for midsize banks similar in size to Silicon Valley Bank, which collapsed suddenly last week. Strengthened rules on banks in the $100 billion to $250 billion range could ape those for larger more systemic banks and involve stringent capital and liquidity requirements or beefed up annual ""stress tests"".

Even though reports abounded of depositor flight from the smaller weaker banks to the larger financial firms, stock prices in the sector at large caught a breath.

That continued in Asia on Wednesday, although Europe's bank stocks and wider bourses stayed in the red and U.S. futures were a touch lower. The VIX equity volatility gauge (.VIX) hugged Tuesday's close at 23.

Apart from fresh Credit Suisse angst, another reason for the persistent trepidation in Europe was signals from central bank sources that the European Central Bank would push ahead with a hefty half-point interest rate rise at its policymaking meeting on Thursday.

If the ECB stays the course and the Fed follows suit next week, anxiety about further banking ructions may return - or at least see further wild volatility in rates markets that could end up having similar effects.

U.S. Treasury market volatility is already at its highest since the aftermath of the last big banking crash in 2009, with the biggest drop since 1987 in 2-year Treasury yields on Monday followed by the biggest one-day jump in 14 years on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, 2-year yields settled about 4.3% - still 80 basis points lower than they were a week ago, but up half a point from Tuesday's trough. Futures markets now see an 80% chance of a quarter-point Fed hike next week to a 4.75-5.0% range, with a 'terminal rate' at 5% in May.

The dollar was slightly higher as rates recalibrated.

Chinese industrial and retail updates for February showed the post-COVID lockdown recovery underway but at an underwhelming pace.

Sterling was steady at investors awaited the Spring UK budget, with bumper tax receipts allowing finance minister Jeremy Hunt to offer some relief to pensions and childcare while extending critical energy price supports.

With widespread trepidation about the impact of the SVB collapse on the U.S. tech sector at large, Facebook-parent Meta (META.O) said on Tuesday it would cut 10,000 jobs this year, making it the first Big Tech company to announce a second round of mass layoffs as the industry braces for a deep economic downturn.

Apple supplier Foxconn (2317.TW) said on Wednesday it expected smart consumer electronics demand would decline slightly this year, as it reported a 10% fall in fourth-quarter net profit from a year earlier.

In more upbeat tech news, startup OpenAI said it is beginning to release a powerful artificial intelligence model known as GPT-4, with image as well as text prompts in searches.

Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday:

* US Feb retail sales and producer prices, US March NAHB housing market index, Empire State manufacturing survey, Jan business inventories.

* UK government's Spring budget

* US corp earnings: Adobe

Summary

Summary Companies Market focus turns to key U.S. inflation data on Thursday

U.S. Democrats make better-than-expected showing in midterms

Bitcoin tumbles as Binance walks away from FTX deal















NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell sharply and the dollar rose on Wednesday as investors awaited both the results of the U.S. midterm elections and key data on consumer prices that could impact the Federal Reserve's policy on interest rates.

A deal for major cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapsed late in the session as bigger rival Binance said it was pulling out, news that heightened concerns about the sector's stability.

Stocks in Europe and on Wall Street fell as the outcome of the midterm elections remained unclear as a better-than-expected showing by Democrats muddied the outlook for fiscal spending and regulation.

""After a few days of positive market performance, the fact that there's some uncertainty about the midterm election outcome is resulting in declines today,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston.

""Markets crave certainty, they don't have it yet.""

Stock markets have tended to perform better under a split government.

Average annual S&P 500 returns have been 14% in a split Congress and 13% in a Republican-controlled Congress under a Democratic president, according to data since 1932 analyzed by RBC Capital Markets. That compares with 10% when Democrats controlled both the presidency and Congress.

""The market is going to get what it wants: it's going to get divided government. It means gridlock is the agenda item for the next two years,"" said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan.

""It's not going to seriously alter spending, but it's also going to block any material increases in spending,"" he said.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 1.95%, the S&P 500 (.SPX) slid 2.08% and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 2.48%.

MSCI's all-country world index (.MIWD00000PUS) shed 1.64% and the pan-European STOXX 600 index (.STOXX) fell 0.30%. Overnight in Asia (.MIAPJ0000PUS) shares had edged up as the election results first rolled in.

Reuters Graphics

Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) tumbled 13.16%, its biggest one-day decline in 21 years, after the entertainment heavyweight reported more losses from its push into streaming video, while Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) gained 5.18% after the Facebook parent said it would cut 13% of its workforce.

Investors cheered Meta's decision to reduce spending, but a weak advertising market for the company points to a difficult economic outlook as the Fed hikes rates to tame high inflation.

Reuters Graphics

Data on the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) is due on Thursday, with economists polled by Reuters forecasting a decline in both the monthly and yearly core numbers for October to 0.5% and 6.5%, respectively.

Many in the market believe the U.S. central bank can reduce its target lending rate if data shows inflation ebbing, but others see it moving ""higher for longer"" as Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated last week.

""Clearly investors are hoping that the rate of inflation begins to roll over, and if that does not happen, I do think that causes some additional volatility in markets,"" Arone said.

Federal fund futures show the Fed's target rate will peak at 5.096% next June, indicating policymakers must hike rates by more than 125 basis points from their current 3.75%-4.0% range.

Bitcoin , the biggest cryptocurrency by market value, fell 13.42% to $16,061.00, lows last seen in November 2020.

Reuters Graphics

The euro was lower, down 0.59% to $1.0013, just off the $1.0096 hit overnight, its highest level since Sept. 13.

The yen weakened 0.45% versus the dollar at 146.36, after weakening overnight to 145.17, its lowest level against the Japanese currency this month.

The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was down 3.1 basis points to 4.097%.

Oil prices sank after industry data showed U.S. crude stockpiles rose more than expected and on concerns a rebound in COVID-19 cases in top importer China would hurt fuel demand.

U.S. crude futures fell $3.08 to settle at $85.83 a barrel and Brent futures settled down $2.71 at $92.65.

Gold dipped as an uptick in the dollar nudged bullion prices off a more than one-month high.

U.S. gold futures settled 0.1% lower at $1,713.70.

Summary Companies U.S. business activity slumps in December

Meta jumps on J.P. Morgan rating upgrade

Adobe climbs on upbeat profit forecast

Dow down 0.85%, S&P 500 down 1.11%, Nasdaq down 0.97%















NEW YORK, Dec 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dropped for a third straight session and suffered a second straight week of losses on Friday as fears continued to mount that the Federal Reserve's campaign to arrest inflation would tilt the economy into a recession.

Equities have been staggered since the U.S. central bank's decision to raise interest rates by 50 basis points (bps), as expected. But comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled more policy tightening, and the central bank projected that interest rates would top the 5% mark in 2023, a level not seen since 2007.

Further comments from other Fed officials fueled the concern. New York Fed President John Williams said on Friday it remains possible the U.S. central bank will raise rates more than it expects next year. The policymaker added that he does not anticipate a recession due to the Fed's aggressive tightening.

In addition, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly said it is ""reasonable"" to believe that once the Fed's policy rates reached their peak, they could stay there into 2024.

""It feels as if finally the market is starting to understand that bad news is bad news, and that is what is starting to occur. Since the October bottoms, the market has continued to price in what I would consider a substantial amount of optimism at the fact the Fed could navigate and pilot a successful soft landing,"" said Dave Wagner, equity analyst and portfolio manager for Aptus Capital Advisors in Cincinnati.

""Finally, the market is taking into consideration that bad news should mean bad things for the market.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 281.76 points, or 0.85%, to 32,920.46; the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 43.39 points, or 1.11%, to 3,852.36; and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 105.11 points, or 0.97%, to 10,705.41.

For the week, the Dow lost 1.66%, the S&P fell 2.09% and the Nasdaq declined 2.72%.

Money market bets show at least two 25 bps rate hikes next year and a terminal rate of about 4.8% by midyear, before falling to around 4.4% by the end of 2023.

On the economic front, a report showed U.S. business activity contracted further in December as new orders slumped to their lowest level in just over 2-1/2 years, although easing demand helped cool inflation.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq on Thursday closed below its 50-day moving average, a key technical level seen as sign of momentum. On Friday, the S&P also closed below its 50-day moving average.

The prospects of a ""Santa Claus rally"", or year-end uptick, in markets this year have dimmed, as the majority of global central banks have adopted tightening policies. The Bank of England and the European Central Bank were the most recent to indicate an extended rate-hike cycle on Thursday.

Markets pared losses in the last hour of trading, however, possibly due in part to the simultaneous expiration of stock options, stock index futures and index options contracts, known as triple witching, which can exacerbate market volatility.

Each of the 11 major S&P 500 sector indexes were in the red, led lower by a drop of more than 2.96% in real estate stocks (.SPLRCR).

Summary Companies Fed hikes, recession fears in focus

L3Harris slides after $4.7 bln Aerojet buyout Indexes down: Dow 0.49%, S&P 0.90%, Nasdaq 1.49%















Dec 19 (Reuters) - Wall Street closed lower on Monday for a fourth straight session with Nasdaq leading declines as investors shied away from riskier bets, worried the Federal Reserve's tightening campaign could push the U.S. economy into a recession.

The three major U.S. stock indexes have been under pressure since Wednesday, when Fed Chair Jerome Powell took a hawkish tone while the central bank raised interest rates. Powell promised further rate increases even as data showed signs of a weakening economy.

The S&P 500 (.SPX), the Dow Jones industrials (.DJI) and the Nasdaq have sold off sharply for December and are on track for their biggest annual declines since the 2008 financial crisis.

While U.S. Treasury yields gained, investors ran from stocks, eyeing prospects of safer bets as they worried about the likelihood of a recession in 2023 according to Brian Overby, senior markets strategist at Ally.

""Investors are asking why do I want to take those risks going into 2023 with the Fed's stance still aggressive when I can get such a good yield on the fixed income market place,"" he said.

The lack of big earnings reports or economic data on Monday likely sharpened investors' focus on economic fears and interest rates, according to Melissa Brown, Global Head of Applied Research at Qontigo in New York.

""It's a knife edge between whether we're going to teeter into a recession or have a soft landing. Is the Fed acting appropriately?"" said Brown who also noted that moves may be exaggerated as many investors take vacation around the end-of-year holidays.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 162.92 points, or 0.49%, to 32,757.54, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 34.7 points, or 0.90%, to 3,817.66 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 159.38 points, or 1.49%, to 10,546.03.

The biggest decliners among S&P industry sectors were communications services (.SPLRCL), which fell 2.2%, consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD), down 1.7% and technology (.SPLRCT), which lost 1.4%. Energy (.SPNY) outperformed, closing up 0.13% as the sole industry out of 11 to manage a gain.

Market heavyweights such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) created some of the biggest drags on the market.

Trading in Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) was volatile with the electric carmaker closing down 0.24% after falling as much as 2.8% during the session. This was after a Twitter poll that showed a majority of respondents want Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk to step down as CEO of the social media platform.

Meta Platforms (META.O) shares finished down 4.1% after the European Commission said it could impose a fine of up to 10% of the tech conglomerate's annual global turnover if evidence showed an infringement of the EU's antitrust laws.

L3Harris Technologies Inc (LHX.N) lost 3.6% after the U.S. defense contractor said it would buy hypersonic engine manufacturer Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc (AJRD.N) for $4.7 billion. Aerojet added 1.3%.

Shares of casino operators Melco Resorts & Entertainment tumbled just under 8% and Wynn Resorts (WYNN.O) lost 5.2% while Las Vegas Sands Corp (LVS.N) fell 2.3% after Macau said on Friday that six casino firms will invest around $15 billion as part of new 10-year contracts they signed to operate in the world's biggest gambling hub.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.80-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.63-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 5 new 52-week highs and 20 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 66 new highs and 456 new lows.

On U.S. exchanges 11.07 billion shares changed hands, compared with the 11.59 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

Goldman mulls 'strategic alternatives' for consumer business

Dow down 0.71%, S&P 500 down 0.30%, Nasdaq down 0.10%















NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed out February in subdued fashion and each of the three major indexes ended with monthly declines, as investors continue to assess whether interest rates will remain high for an extended period of time.

After a strong performance in January, stocks retreated in February as economic data and comments from U.S. Federal Reserve officials prompted market participants to reconsider the odds the central bank would hike rates to a higher level than market forecasts and keep them elevated for longer than was initially expected.

""The market in many ways expected things to go south more quickly, forcing the Fed to pivot, or pause, or cut rates sooner than the Fed was saying,"" said Johan Grahn, head ETF market strategist at Allianz Investment Management in Minneapolis.

""The staying power of the Fed is much more determined and steadfast than the staying power of investors so it’s back to the old mantra of do you really want to fight the Fed on this and in this case it is still a mistake to try and do that.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 232.39 points, or 0.71%, to 32,656.7, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 12.09 points, or 0.30%, to 3,970.15 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 11.44 points, or 0.1%, to 11,455.54.

For the month, the S&P 500 fell 2.61%, the Dow slid 4.19% and the Nasdaq shed 1.11%

Traders have started to price in the chances of a bigger 50 basis-point rate hike in March, although the odds remain low at about 23%, according to Fed fund futures, which suggest rates peaking at 5.4% by September, up from 4.57% now.

BofA Global Research cautioned the Fed could even hike interest rates to nearly 6%.

Economic data on Tuesday, however showed a reading of consumer confidence unexpectedly fell in February, while a gauge of home prices slowed further in December.

The blue-chip Dow (.DJI) dipped, weighed down by a 3.80% drop in Goldman Sachs (GS.N) after Chief Executive David Solomon said the bank is considering ""strategic alternatives"" for its consumer business.

The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was up 2.3 basis points at 4.816%. A pullback in yields following the economic data helped boost the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, but the two indexes faded late in the session to close lower.

Volatility has been common since the Fed began its rate hiking cycle last year. The S&P 500 has seen 18 sessions with gains or losses of at least 1% this year, equal to the first two months of 2022, which eventually saw 122 such trading days on the year.

Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said the Fed must supplement traditional government data and readings from financial markets with real-time, on-the-ground observations of economic conditions if it is to make good policy, and not rely on market reactions.

Meta Platforms (META.O) rose 3.19% after the Facebook parent said it was creating a new top-level product group focused on generative artificial intelligence.

Target Corp (TGT.N) gained 1.01% after the big-box retailer reported a surprise rise in holiday-quarter sales but cautioned on 2023 earnings due to an uncertain U.S. economy.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NCLH.N) plunged 10.18% after the cruise operator's full-year profit forecast fell short of estimates. It attributes the squeeze to soaring fuel and labor costs.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.63 billion shares, compared with the 11.46 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.13-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 9 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 85 new highs and 91 new lows.

Energy stocks drop as crude trades at lowest level since Jan

Indexes down: Dow 1.03%, S&P 1.44%, Nasdaq 2%















Dec 6 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 extending its losing streak to four sessions, as skittish investors fretted over Federal Reserve rate hikes and further talk of a looming recession.

Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) dragged down markets, with its shares sliding 6.8% following reports that European Union regulators have ruled the company should not require users to agree to personalized ads based on their digital activity.

However, technology names generally suffered as investors applied caution toward high-growth companies whose performance would be sluggish in a challenging economy. Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) fell between 2.5% and 3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was pulled lower for a third straight session.

Most of the 11 major S&P sectors declined, with energy and communications services (.SPLRCL) joining technology (.SPLRCT) as leading laggards. Utilities (.SPLRCU), a defensive sector often preferred during times of economic uncertainty, was the only exception, gaining 0.7%.

Future economic growth prospects were in focus on Tuesday following comments from financial titans pointing toward uncertain times ahead.

Bank of America Corp's (BAC.N) chief executive predicted three quarters of mild negative growth next year, while JPMorgan Chase and Co's (JPM.N) CEO Jamie Dimon said inflation will erode consumer spending power and that a mild to more pronounced recession was likely ahead.

Their comments came on the heels of recent views from BlackRock and others that believe the U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary tightening to combat stubbornly high price rises could induce an economic downturn in 2023.

""The market is very reactive right now,"" said David Sadkin, president at Bel Air Investment Advisors.

He noted that, while markets traditionally reflect the future, right now they are moving up and down based on the latest headlines.

Fears about economic growth come amid a re-evaluation by traders of what path future interest rate hikes will take, following strong data on jobs and the services sector in recent days.

Money market bets are pointing to a 91% chance that the U.S. central bank might raise rates by 50 basis points at its Dec. 13-14 policy meeting, with rates expected to peak at 4.98% in May 2023, up from 4.92% estimated on Monday before service-sector data was released.

The S&P 500 rallied 13.8% in October and November on hopes of smaller rate hikes and better-than-expected earnings, although such Fed expectations could be undermined by further data releases, including producer prices due out on Friday.

""The market got ahead of itself at the end of November, but then we got some good economic data, so people are re-evaluating what the Fed is going to do next week,"" said Bel Air's Sadkin.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 350.76 points, or 1.03%, to close at 33,596.34, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 57.58 points, or 1.44%, to finish at 3,941.26 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 225.05 points, or 2%, to end on 11,014.89.

Jitters on the direction of global growth have also weighed on oil prices, with U.S. crude slipping to levels last seen in January, before Russia's invasion of Ukraine disrupted supply markets. The energy sector (.SPNY) fell 2.7% on Tuesday.

Banks are among the most sensitive stocks to an economic downturn, as they potentially face negative effects from bad loans or slowing loan growth. The S&P banks index (.SPXBK) slipped 1.4% to its lowest close since Oct. 21.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.01 billion shares, in line with the average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

The S&P 500 posted three new 52-week highs and nine new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 52 new highs and 262 new lows.

893,META,2022-12-15,Holiday bookings are back at upscale restaurants - at higher prices,"













NEW YORK, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Holiday parties are back at posh eateries - even with soaring menu prices.

At the Michelin-starred restaurant Boka in Chicago, bookings are back to pre-pandemic levels. But the whole-roasted, dry-aged duck for two runs $110 – 22% more than it was two years ago.

Instead of big parties for 75 to 150 people, guests are planning more moderate gatherings for 20 to 30 people, said Boka Restaurant Group co-founder Kevin Boehm.

Private event bookings at Charlie Palmer Steak NYC are also increasing, but more new clients are reserving rooms that can accommodate 30 to 75 people instead of 200, said the chain's sales director, Thomas Young.

After government COVID-19 curbs shuttered dining rooms in 2020 and the Omicron variant of the coronavirus stymied gatherings in 2021, ritzy restaurants are finally hosting holiday parties again this year despite higher menu prices and a looming economic recession.

""This year there's been a really exciting buildup of people getting back together again, which coincided with people going back to the office,"" Boehm said.

Robust restaurant events indicate optimism about spending and the economy - a positive sign even as Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), DoorDash Inc (DASH.N), banks including Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and other employers have announced major layoffs in the last few weeks.

In the UK, labor strikes by railway workers and snowy weather have started to cause restaurant cancellations, said Martin Williams, CEO of owner Rare Restaurants, which runs Argentine steakhouse brand Gaucho and grill-centric M Restaurants.

Even so, sales at Gaucho and M Restaurants have grown about 50% in the first two weeks of December versus 2019. December was the first month during the pandemic in which bookings increased for group events, he said, citing pent-up demand to celebrate the holidays.

In Manchester, England, dining at high-priced restaurants rose 18% from Dec. 1-12 versus the same period last year, even as overall dining in Manchester fell 13%, according to online booking site OpenTable.

BEEF PRICES BE DAMNED

At steakhouse chain Smith & Wollensky's Boston location, a 10-ounce coffee and cocoa rubbed filet mignon now costs $65, or 18% more than in 2020, due to higher beef costs. The chain did not reply to requests for comment.

In November, comparative sales for high-end U.S. steakhouses were 17.4% higher than in 2019 on both higher menu prices and increased foot traffic, according to Knapp Track data.

This quarter, Ruth's Chris Steak House owner Ruth's Hospitality Group Inc (RUTH.O) is on track to post comparable sales growth of 5.4%, Refinitiv data shows.

Diners are still eating out in part because the cost of groceries has risen even more than a restaurant meal. The cost of groceries eaten at home is expected to rise 11%-12% in 2022, versus predictions for increases of 7-8% in restaurant food prices, according to November forecasts from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Many independent restaurants also still have not raised menu prices enough to offset the higher cost of goods, for fear of scaring off diners.

""We can't keep up with it,"" said Ann Hsing, chief operating officer of the French bistro Pasjoli in Santa Monica, California, referring to inflation.

The cost of turkey, butter, truffles and canola have all risen threefold or more, prompting Pasjoli to hike the price of its Thanksgiving to-go boxes by about 40% to $140 this year from last year. Pasjoli's email inbox has been flooded with requests for information about private events, she said.

Overall, Thanksgiving reservations in the United States – usually a signal for the rest of the holiday season – were up 6% over last year and about flat compared with pre-pandemic levels, according to data from OpenTable.

""Short of some other external pandemic-esque-type event, we're quite bullish on what's going to happen this holiday season,"" OpenTable CEO Debby Soo said.

New York's iconic Tavern on the Green in Central Park was closed for much of 2020, and last year many people cancelled their holiday parties there due to Omicron.

Now, tourists and guests are making up for years of lost experiences, undeterred by the fact that the Chocolate Peanut Butter Lava cake costs $16, which is 14% more than it did in January 2020, owner Jim Caiola said. Booking levels are higher than in 2019.

""It feels amazing,"" Caiola said. ""I'm very full of hope.""

894,META,2022-12-02,U.S. job growth likely slowed again in November; labor market still tight,"Summary

Summary Companies Nonfarm payrolls forecast increasing 200,000 in November

Unemployment rate seen unchanged at 3.7%

Average hourly earnings forecast gaining 0.3%; up 4.6% y/y















WASHINGTON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - U.S. job growth was likely the smallest in nearly two years in November as mounting worries of a recession cooled demand for labor, which could give the Federal Reserve confidence to start slowing the pace of its interest rate hikes this month.

The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday, which is also expected to show a continued moderation in wage gains last month, would follow on the heels of news on Thursday of a slowdown in inflation in October.

But the labor market remains tight, with 1.7 job openings for every unemployed person in October, keeping the Fed on its monetary tightening path at least through the first half of 2023. Labor market strength is also one of the reasons economists believe an anticipated recession next year would be short and shallow.

""It's kind of like it's good news but not great news. The labor market is still very strong and still very tight,"" said Agron Nicaj, U.S. economist at MUFG in New York. ""The Fed might slow down the pace of rate hikes, but they are not at a point where they are going to completely stop.""

The survey of business establishments is likely to show that nonfarm payrolls increased by 200,000 jobs last month, according to a Reuters poll of economists, the smallest number since December 2020, after rising by 261,000 in October. Estimates ranged from 133,000 to 270,000.

The Reuters poll was, however, conducted before an Institute for Supply Management report on Thursday, which showed manufacturing contracting in November for the first time in 2-1/2 years, with a measure of factory employment falling sharply. That prompted some economists to lower their November payrolls forecasts.

October payrolls could be revised lower after the household survey, from which the unemployment rate is derived, showed a loss of 328,000 jobs that month, which economists said could have an impact on the employment count for November.

Employment growth averaged 407,000 jobs per month this year compared with 562,000 in 2021. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday the U.S. central bank could scale back the pace of its rate increases ""as soon as December.""

Fed officials meet on Dec. 13 and 14. The Fed has raised its policy rate by 375 basis points this year from near zero to a 3.75%-4.00% range in the fastest rate-hiking cycle since the 1980s as it battles high inflation.

COMPANIES RIGHT-SIZING

Economists said most of the slowdown in hiring was by big companies. Technology companies, including Twitter, Amazon (AMZN.O) and Meta (META.O), the parent of Facebook, have announced thousands of jobs cuts.

Economists said these companies were right-sizing after over-hiring during the COVID-19 pandemic. They noted that small firms remained desperate for workers.

There were 10.3 million job openings at the end of October, many of them in the leisure and hospitality as well as healthcare and social assistance industries.

""The S&P 500 companies are not going to be driving job growth, its mainly going to be the small business sector,"" said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Boston College.

The unemployment rate is seen unchanged at 3.7%, consistent with a still-tight labor market. Average hourly earnings are forecast to have increased 0.3% after advancing 0.4% in October. That would lower the annual increase in wages to a still-high 4.6% from 4.7% in October. Wages growth peaked at 5.6% in March.

""This is a pace that is uncomfortably high for the Fed and not consistent with the 2% inflation target, though officials may take some comfort from the downward trajectory in the annual pace over the past eight months,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Data on Thursday showed the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, climbed 5.0% on a year-on-year basis in October after increasing 5.2% in September.

The wage gains are helping consumers to weather the inflation storm, keeping the economy on a steady growth path and raising cautious optimism that the nation could avoid a recession altogether.

""I still believe the economy tips into a short and shallow recession mid-2023, based on eroding labor market growth, but the probability of no recession is now higher,"" said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard in New York.

895,META,2022-09-14,"Google loses challenge against EU antitrust decision, other probes loom","













LUXEMBOURG, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Google suffered one of its biggest setbacks on Wednesday when a top European court upheld a ruling that it broke competition rules and fined it a record 4.1 billion euros, in a move that may encourage other regulators to ratchet up pressure on the U.S. giant.

The unit of U.S. tech giant Alphabet (GOOGL.O) had challenged an EU antitrust ruling, but the decision was broadly upheld by Europe's General Court, with the fine trimmed modestly to 4.125 billion euros ($4.13 billion) from 4.34 billion euros.

Even with the reduction, it was still a record fine for an antitrust violation. The EU antitrust enforcer has fined the world's most popular internet search engine a total of 8.25 billion euros in three investigations stretching back more than a decade.

The judgment is set to boost landmark rules aimed at curbing the power of U.S. tech giants that will go into effect next year. read more

""The judgment strengthens the hand of the Commission. It confirms the Commission can use antitrust proceedings as a backstop threat to enforce rapid compliance with digital regulation also known as the DMA,"" said Nicolas Petit, professor at European University Institute.

EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager did not mince her words.

""This, of course, is really good. Now, we have the second Google judgment and for us, it is really important as it backs our enforcement efforts,"" she said.

This is the second court defeat for Google which lost its challenge to a 2.42 billion euro ($2.42 billion) fine last year, the first of a trio of cases.

""The General Court largely confirms the Commission's decision that Google imposed unlawful restrictions on manufacturers of Android mobile devices and mobile network operators in order to consolidate the dominant position of its search engine,"" the court said.

""In order better to reflect the gravity and duration of the infringement, the General Court considers it appropriate however to impose a fine of 4.125 billion euros on Google, its reasoning differing in certain respects from that of the Commission,"" judges said.

Google, which can appeal on matters of law to the EU Court of Justice, Europe's highest, voiced its disappointment.

""We are disappointed that the Court did not annul the decision in full. Android has created more choice for everyone, not less, and supports thousands of successful businesses in Europe and around the world,"" a spokesperson said.

ANTITRUST BOOST

The ruling is a boost for Vestager after the General Court overturned her decisions against Intel (INTC.O) and Qualcomm (QCOM.O) earlier this year.

Vestager has made her crackdown against Big Tech a hallmark of her job, a move which has encouraged regulators in the United States and elsewhere to follow suit.

She is currently investigating Google's digital advertising business, its Jedi Blue ad deal with Meta (META.O), Apple's (AAPL.O) App Store rules, Meta's marketplace and data use and Amazon's (AMZN.O) online selling and market practices.

The Court agreed with the Commission's assessment that iPhone maker Apple (AAPL.O) was not in the same market and therefore could not be a competitive constraint against Android.

The court backing could reinforce the EU antitrust watchdog in its investigations into Apple's business practices in the music streaming market, which the regulator says Apple dominates.

FairSearch, whose 2013 complaint triggered the EU case, said the judgment may lead to more competition in the smartphone market.

""This shows the European Commission got it right. Google can no longer impose its will on phone makers. Now they may open their devices to competition in search and other services, allowing consumers to benefit from increased choice,"" its lawyer Thomas Vinje said.

The Commission in its 2018 decision said Google used Android to cement its dominance in general internet search via payments to large manufacturers and mobile network operators and restrictions.

Google said it acted like countless other businesses and that such payments and agreements help keep Android a free operating system, criticising the EU decision as out of step with the economic reality of mobile software platforms.

The case is T-604/18 Google vs European Commission.

April 26 (Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) on Tuesday reported its first quarterly revenue miss of the pandemic after the war in Ukraine hurt YouTube ad sales, leaving investors rattled as the global economy sputters.

The world's largest provider of search and video made a fortune over the last two years as the pandemic forced more shops and people online. But outdoing those sales is proving difficult so far this year with the war, rising inflation and product shortages causing advertisers to dump marketing campaigns, according to analysts.

Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said it was too early to predict when sales slowed by the war may pick up and warned that the strengthening U.S. dollar would hurt sales even more in the current quarter.

Alphabet shares, which were up nearly 90% over the past two years, fell about 2.5% after the results late on Tuesday. They had dropped 3.6% during the regular session.

David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, voiced growing concerns about the macro environment. ""Alphabet has been seen as one of the most insulated companies in the advertising space relative to peers, but sometimes you can still own the best house in the worst neighborhood,"" he said.

Alphabet said first-quarter sales rose to $68.01 billion, up 23% from last year but below the average estimate of $68.1 billion among financial analysts tracked by Refinitiv, its first miss since the fourth quarter of 2019.

Notably, YouTube advertising sales of $6.9 billion missed analysts' target of $7.5 billion, according to FactSet.

Porat said the war in Ukraine that began during the quarter had an ""outsized impact"" on YouTube revenue because the company stopped ad sales in Russia and brand advertisers, particularly in Europe, pulled back on spending after fighting broke out. read more

Google overall derived 1% of its sales in 2021 from Russia, Porat said.

She also reported moderating growth in sales to direct-response advertisers on YouTube, and added that cuts to app store fees to address antitrust concerns had wiped out gains in subscription revenue.

Google's ""other"" revenue, which includes app, hardware and subscription sales, were $6.8 billion, below estimates of $7.3 billion.

Quarterly profit was $16.44 billion, or $24.62 per share, missing expectations of $25.76 per share.

Alphabet also said its board had authorized an additional $70 billion in stock repurchases. It has bought back over $81 billion in shares over the last two years.

AD SLOWDOWN

Google is expected to grab 29%, or the leading share, of the $602 billion global online ad market in 2022, at least the 12th straight year it has been on top, according to Insider Intelligence.

Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a note that the macro environment could bring some ups and downs for Alphabet, although the company remained indispensable to consumers and advertisers.

Last week, Snap Inc (SNAP.N) warned that inflation, labor shortages and other economic challenges could pressure ad revenue. read more

Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O), the second-biggest online advertising platform with an expected 21.4% share of the global market in 2022, reports earnings on Wednesday. Its shares fell 2.5% on Tuesday after Alphabet's results.

Increasing competition from companies such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and ByteDance's TikTok are chipping away at Google ad sales, too. Still, retailers continue to pour money into ads and travel and entertainment advertisers are ramping up again. In addition, Google is better positioned than rivals to withstand economic shocks because its advertising tools tend to be among the last abandoned by advertisers as they are well known, easy to use and reach more users than alternatives.

High on the list of risks faced by the company are numerous lawsuits and investigations into whether Google has engaged in anticompetitive conduct through its advertising and other businesses.

The latest scrutiny has been on its pending $5.4 billion acquisition of cybersecurity services provider Mandiant, which the U.S. Department of Justice is reviewing closely. Google has said it still expects to close the deal this year. read more

Google Cloud, the unit that would contain Mandiant, increased revenue in the first quarter by 44% compared with a year ago to $5.82 billion.

897,META,2023-02-24,Exclusive: Netflix making preparations to open Vietnam office,"













SINGAPORE, Feb 24 (Reuters) - U.S streaming giant Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) is making preparations to open an office in Vietnam after years of negotiations with authorities and completing a risk assessment, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.

A local office would make Netflix the first major U.S tech firm with a direct presence in the fast-growing Southeast Asian country of 100 million, increasingly seen as too lucrative to ignore despite wariness over its stringent internet rules.

Netflix declined to comment in response to Reuters questions about its plans and its current operations in Vietnam.

The company is in the early stage of planning for a local entity in Vietnam after completing an assessment in late 2022 that evaluated security and political risks of operating an office in Vietnam and the handling of user data and sensitive content, the sources said.

The people declined to be identified because the preparations are confidential.

The office could open as early as late 2023 but will require a lengthy regulatory process that could take longer, according to one of the sources.

Authorities announced a new decree, effective from January, requiring video-on-demand service providers to seek licences from the Vietnamese government to operate, which would in turn require establishing a local office, although details of implementation remain unclear.

Vietnam has proven complex for tech firms to navigate, due in part to a lack of clarity on specific requirements and enforcement mechanisms for its often strict regulations, foreign executives familiar with operations in the country have said.

Although Vietnam's cybersecurity law of 2018 requires all foreign businesses earning income from online activities in Vietnam to open a local office, only TikTok owner ByteDance has so far complied, even though several other social media providers count Vietnam as one of their top-10 global markets.

As Vietnamese officials grow more confident in the country's rising consumer power, however, they have begun ramping up pressure on tech firms to abide by the rules.

They threatened to shut down Facebook in 2020 over political content on the platform, and in 2022 introduced new regulations requiring that tech firms store user data locally and that social media firms remove within 24 hours what the authorities deem to be false content.

NETFLIX MEETING

Netflix told senior Vietnamese government officials it was studying the possibility of opening a local representative office during a December 2022 meeting with the firm's Asia business strategy vice president, according to a statement posted on the Ministry of Planning and Investment's website.

Nguyen Van Doan, a senior official at the ministry, ""expressed his wish that Netflix soon establish a legal entity in Vietnam and contribute to the development of the Vietnamese economy,"" the statement said.

Vietnam's information ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

With the fastest growing middle class in Southeast Asia, Vietnam has become a key market for tech giants.

Its digital economy including fintech, e-commerce and online entertainment is on track to grow to nearly $50 billion in total transactions per year by 2025, more than double last year's figure, according to a report by Google, Temasek Holdings and Bain & Company.

Vietnam's ruling Communist Party maintains tight media censorship and tolerates little dissent, with strict rules over online content, while the government is keeping increasingly close tabs on foreign players in the sector.

The authorities announced last month that they had collected 1.8 trillion dong ($78 million) in taxes from Google, Meta, Netflix and TikTok in 2022.

The Vietnamese government had for years been demanding tax payments by tech giants, including Netflix, that were operating without local offices, according to sources familiar with the matter.

Companies had said they lacked a proper mechanism to pay tax in Vietnam, although this was addressed last year with the creation of an online portal for that purpose.

Social media companies have faced particular pressure over content, including pending rules over the posting of news-related content on social media accounts, although Netflix has also on occasion been the target of public orders by the government to block domestic access to content judged ""offensive to the Vietnamese people"".

This included in 2022 the Hollywood film ""Uncharted"", which referenced Chinese claims in the South China Sea, and the South Korean drama ""Little Women"", which contained scenes of the Vietnam War.

898,META,2022-03-23,EXCLUSIVE Indonesia preparing tough new curbs for online platforms -sources,"













SINGAPORE/JAKARTA, March 23 (Reuters) - Indonesia is readying tough new rules that will allow it to fine and criminally charge internet and social media platforms, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said, potentially slowing online firms' rapid growth in a $70 billion market.

The rules, which authorities believe are needed to make platforms remove ""unlawful"" content quickly, are among the most stringent globally on social media and follow intensifying crackdowns on online content that have alarmed activists in countries like India.

Indonesia is a top-10 market globally by number of users for social media companies, including Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Youtube, TikTok, Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Meta's (FB.O) Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp.

Some executives of online companies briefed on the plans warned the measures will be hard to comply with, raise their operating costs, and could undermine freedom of expression in the world's fourth most populous country, the sources said.

The new rules, which build upon internet regulations from 2019, mean companies will be required to take down content deemed unlawful within four hours if a request is designated as ""urgent"", the sources said. Other requests, which can come from any government agency, will be have to be met within 24 hours.

The measures, which are being drafted by Indonesia's finance and communications ministries, are due to be finalised soon and brought in from June, the sources told Reuters.

The six sources from companies and government declined to be named as the discussions were confidential.

Officials told internet companies that ""urgent"" government requests would include content perceived as sensitive in areas such as ""security, terrorism and public order, child protection, and pornography"", two of the sources said.

After receiving an official complaint, companies will be fined per item of content, with fines rising the longer content stays on platforms, according to three sources and a government document reviewed by Reuters.

Fines will be determined by the size of a company in terms of local users and the ""content severity"", according to the document. The quantum of fines is still to be finalised but could amount to millions of rupiah (1 million rupiah = $69.71)per item.

And platforms failing to comply with government requests on too many occasions could be blocked in Indonesia and their staff might face criminal sanctions, two of the sources said.

The regulations will apply to all internet and digital platforms determined to be ""internet system operators"", ranging from social media giants to e-commerce and fintech companies as well as telecommunication firms.

Indonesia's finance and communications ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

RISK OF CRIMINAL SANCTIONS

Compared to Indonesia's proposed measures, social media companies in Vietnam are required to remove offending content from their platforms within one day of receiving a request from the authorities. India gives companies 36 hours windows to remove, with possible criminal sanctions if they don't comply.

The ""trigger"" for Indonesia's tougher measures was a flood of unlawful online content ranging from fraud to political and coronavirus hoaxes or disinformation, said one government official familiar with the matter.

""We need firm actions now because the government has been criticised and deemed incapable of carrying out its obligations,"" said the official.

Five company sources involved in the talks said both local and international firms did not have enough staff to comply with government requests on time and the appeals process on cases remains unclear. Two warned it could prompt ""over-censorship"" by platforms.

The regulations will have the biggest impact on social media companies, which count Indonesia's youthful population of 270 million as a huge opportunity for growth.

Meta's Facebook reached as many as 150 million users in Indonesia in 2021, according to company data. Indonesia's booming digital economy reached $70 billion according to a report by Bain, Google, and Temasek.

Meta, Alphabet, Twitter, and Tiktok did not answer requests for comment.

Three sources at three social media firms said they were concerned about possible government overreach on online content.

""There's a lack of (clear) definitions on what's covered, as under 'terrorism', we could be asked to take down criticism of the government on topics like West Papua,"" one source told Reuters, referring to Indonesia's easternmost area that has suffered a simmering decades-long separatist conflict and where the government has labelled separatists ""terrorists"".

""Many issues on freedom of expression are going to appear.""
