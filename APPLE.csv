March 14 (Reuters) - The share price of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) reached $500,000 for the first time on Monday, reflecting the company's status as a defensive stock in a market unsettled by events in Ukraine and rising inflation.

Berkshire's Class A shares have risen 10% in 2022, outpacing the Standard & Poor's 500 index (.SPX), which has fallen 12%.

The Omaha, Nebraska-based company's market value is approximately $731 billion, ranking sixth in the United States, and Buffett's 16.2% stake makes him the world's fifth-richest person at $119.2 billion, according to Forbes magazine.

Berkshire generated a record $27.46 billion of operating profit last year, including gains at Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy.

It also owns dozens of other businesses, including the fast-growing Clayton Homes mobile home unit and the largest U.S. residential real estate brokerage.

Berkshire specializes in ""on the ground, Main Street-esque business activity,"" said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management Inc in Phoenix, which invests about $4.3 billion and owns Berkshire stock.

""They're big and they're not a tech stock, and investors get comfort from that.""

Berkshire shares also slightly outperformed the S&P 500 in 2021, after lagging in 2019 and 2020. They closed up 0.8% on Monday at $493,785.

Most Berkshire operating units focus on the United States, and about 77% of its approximately 372,000 employees work there.

Among those expanding elsewhere is Dairy Queen, which plans by 2030 to add 600 stores in China, already its largest market outside the United States.

Berkshire traded below $20 when Buffett took over the then-struggling textile company in 1965. Its Class B shares are worth about 1/1500th of Class A shares.

U.S. companies with larger market capitalizations include Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Amazon.com Inc and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O). Apple is also Berkshire's largest common stock holding.

Berkshire ended 2021 with $146.7 billion in cash, though it has since invested well over $5 billion in Occidental Petroleum Corp as oil prices soared.

1,287,APPLE,2022-03-14,Apple supplier Foxconn in talks to build factory in Saudi Arabia - WSJ,"













March 14 (Reuters) - Foxconn Technology Group (2317.TW) is in talks with Saudi Arabia about jointly building a $9 billion facility that could make microchips, electric-vehicle components and other electronics, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.

Saudi Arabia is reviewing Foxconn's offer to build a dual-line semiconductor contract manufacturing facility known as a ""foundry"" in Neom, a tech-focused city-state it is developing in the desert, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

The company and Saudi Arabia authorities did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and a major Apple (AAPL.O) supplier, has expanded into areas including electric vehicles (EVs) and semiconductors in recent years.

The company and other Taiwanese firms like TSMC , are looking to diversify their production amid U.S.-China trade tensions, which have impacted the semiconductor industry.

Besides Saudi Arabia, Foxconn is also talking with the United Arab Emirates about potentially situating the project there, the report said.

Riyadh wants the company to guarantee that it would direct at least two-thirds of the foundry's production into Foxconn's existing supply chain, according to the report.

Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, has been signing large investment deals, including plans in Taiwan and India. Last year, however, it drastically scaled back a planned $10 billion factory in Wisconsin that former U.S. President Donald Trump once called ""the eighth wonder of the world"".

TAIPEI/BEIJING, March 14 (Reuters) - China's efforts to curb its largest COVID-19 outbreak in two years has forced companies from Apple (AAPL.O) supplier Foxconn to automakers Toyota (7203.T) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) to suspend some operations, raising concerns over supply chain disruptions.

Multiple Chinese provinces and cities have tightened restrictions in line with Beijing's zero-tolerance goal of suppressing contagion as quickly as possible, among them the southern Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen. read more

Shenzhen, China's Silicon Valley, is carrying out mass testing after dozens of new local cases were recorded. Officials have suspended public transport and urged people to work at home this week as much as possible. read more

White House press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Monday that the Biden Administration was monitoring the lockdown of the tech hub ""incredibly closely.""

""What we're looking at is of course ... the impact on some of these ports around the impacted areas of China,"" she said in a Monday afternoon briefing.

China has reported more local symptomatic COVID-19 cases so far this year than it recorded in all of 2021. read more

Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said its Shenzhen operations would be suspended until further notice, adding it would deploy backup plants to reduce disruption.

Two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Foxconn and its subsidiaries' operations in Shenzhen would be suspended for the first half of the week.

One of the people said the government was allowing companies to operate if they could create a ""closed management"" system where employees would live and work in a bubble. Such a system was in place during the Beijing Winter Olympics.

Other Taiwan companies which said they had suspended Shenzhen operations included chip substrate and printed circuit board maker Unimicron Technology Corp (3037.TW), which also supplies Apple and Intel , and flexible printed circuit board maker Sunflex Technology Co Ltd .

Sunflex said its plant would be closed until Sunday.

Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Intel declined to comment.

Paul Weedman, who runs manufacturing consultancy Victure Industrial Co., Ltd in Shenzhen, warned that the restrictions were having a ripple effect beyond Shenzhen to the wider Guangdong province. Production for some of his customers' orders have been suspended, and many factory visits cancelled, he said.

""Imagine you have a factory of 100 people and all of a sudden you can’t do anything - you can’t fulfil your existing orders, you can’t accept new orders. The impact is not 2 or 3 weeks, but 3-6 months.""

Shenzhen's Yantian International Container Terminal (YICT), one of China's busiest ports, said in a WeChat statement it was operating normally, although two companies with warehouses at the port said they needed to temporarily suspend operations.

CHANGCHUN LOCKDOWN

Other cities have enacted restrictions to varying extents. Officials have locked down Changchun city, the capital of northeastern Jilin province, shut schools in the financial hub of Shanghai and suspended public transport in the manufacturing centre of Dongguan.

Toyota (7203.T) said on Monday its joint venture with China's FAW Group had suspended production in Changchun, while its Tianjin city operations remained unaffected.

Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), which also has a joint venture with FAW, said it had suspended production at its vehicle and component plants from Monday to Wednesday. FAW, which is headquartered in Changchun, did not respond to a request for comment.

A factory owner in Dongguan, who gave his surname as Lau, said his plant was forced to shut down from Sunday until Tuesday. They were also experiencing some issues in obtaining materials from suppliers due to the virus restrictions, he added.

""Hopefully they will let us carry on with the production soon,"" he said. ""There's not much we can do. The whole world has moved on, except for China. They should just let go of the zero-COVID strategy.""

4,650,APPLE,2022-03-15,Shenzhen lockdown will not have a big impact on iPhone production -J.P.Morgan,"













March 15 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhone production will not take a big hit from Foxconn's suspension of operations in the Chinese city of Shenzen, which is facing fresh curbs to contain a COVID outbreak, J.P. Morgan analysts said.

Apple's key supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, known as Foxconn, (2317.TW) said it had suspended operations in Shenzhen until further notice and would deploy backup plants to reduce disruption. read more

""We believe the impact from the Shenzhen lockdown on iPhone EMS build should be limited (~10% maximum of global iPhone production), due to low season and small production exposure to Shenzhen,"" analyst Gokul Hariharan wrote in a note dated Monday.

J.P.Morgan also said the Shenzhen region represents less than 20% of total iPhone production capacity for Hon Hai, with vast majority of assembly plants located in Zhengzhou, an industrial and transport hub.

Many factories in China, including plants run by automakers Toyota (7203.T) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), were suspended due to the restrictions. read more

The brokerage does not anticipate an industry-wide restocking for components due to these production suspensions, but warns that lockdowns in the Shanghai region could be more disruptive.

The lockdown in Shenzhen, China's Silicon Valley, will not have a big impact on semiconductor production, it said, while adding that global LCD panel supply could be hurt.

SHANGHAI, March 15 (Reuters) - Manufacturers of everything from flash drives to glass for Apple iPhone screens are warning of shipment delays as they comply with Chinese controls to curb the spread of COVID-19, further straining global supply chains.

Authorities across China are trying to try stem the spread of the country's worst COVID-19 outbreak in two years, putting millions of people in lockdown, curbing transport and shutting factories.

Some of the toughest measures have been applied in the key manufacturing hubs of Shenzhen, Dongguan and Changchun, as well as the Chinese financial centre of Shanghai, which is home to the world's busiest container port.

Fabien Gaussorgues, who provides contract manufacturing services from a factory in Dongguan, said he was struggling to procure parts needed for electric scooters, warehouse robots and electric toys because of the shutdowns.

""It's not critical yet but it's getting more difficult every day,"" Gaussorgues said. ""Suppliers in Shenzhen cannot produce, so they're not delivering goods. So next week we don't have material for production,"" he added.

Lens Technology , which supplies lenses and glass material to customers such as Apple (AAPL.O), said on Monday the production and delivery of some products would be impacted after it suspended work at its Dongguan plant.

And Netac Technology (300042.SZ), which makes portable hard drives and USB flash drives, similarly warned of shipment delays as its factory in Shenzhen had to stop work.

While major ports in Shenzhen and Shanghai said they were operating normally, logistic providers said there were trucking delays due to road and testing restrictions and some firms in Shenzhen had stopped their warehouses from accepting deliveries.

Refinitiv data showed increased container congestion at key Chinese shipping hubs, with the number of vessels awaiting docking in the outer anchorages of the Yangtze Estuary, Pearl River Delta, Zhoushan and Qingdao port more than double the average of March 2021.

Chinese share prices, which plunged on Monday, slumped to close at 21-month lows on Tuesday as surging coronavirus cases threatened the outlook for the world's second-largest economy.

Other companies which have warned that the COVID-19 curbs are impacting their businesses include Chinese automaker BYD (002594.SZ), KFC operator Yum China (9987.HK), iPhone assembler Foxconn (2317.TW), Toyota (7203.T) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE).

BYD, headquartered in Shenzhen where most companies have been told to ask staff to work from home, said that there had been some impact on production at its site.

""We are actively coordinating a response and carrying out epidemic prevention and control,"" BYD said.

Yum, operator of KFC and Pizza Hut in China, said on Monday during an earnings briefing that its operations had been significantly impacted by the outbreaks, and same-store sales fell 20% year-on-year in the first two weeks of March.

""It's a very tough month for every food service retailer in China,"" a source at a large Western catering chain told Reuters.

6,787,APPLE,2022-03-16,Link-organizing service Linktree raises $110 mln in funding round,"













March 16 (Reuters) - The link-organizing service Linktree said Wednesday it has closed a $110 million funding round, led by Index Ventures and Coatue, which values the company at $1.3 billion.

The Melbourne-based company also said it hired Mike Olson, an executive who most recently serving as senior vice president of growth initiatives at Twitch, as its first president. He will focus on expansion in the United States.

Co-founder and Chief Executive Alex Zaccaria said he and his brother, Anthony, founded the company based on insights gleaned while working as digital strategists for bands. They found that while musicians had multiple sources of revenue -- music streaming, merchandise and concert tours -- social media sites restrict the number of links the artist can use to promote their work.

Linktree was launched to address this problem, Zaccaria said. Artists such as Selena Gomez use a single Linktree link in their social media bios to bring fans to a site where they can shop for merchandise, donate to her charitable organization supporting mental health, check out her Hulu series, ""Only Murders in the Building"" or find her music on Spotify, YouTube or Apple Music.

Zaccaria said the service, founded in 2016, has expanded well beyond its music roots. It now boasts 24 million users, from global brands such as Red Bull and Comedy Central to artists and personalities like Shawn Mendes and Dwayne Johnson.

The basic service is free, though users can pay up to $24 a month for more sophisticated features, such as the ability to collect email addresses and phone numbers or allow visitors to make purchases from their Linktree site.

Prior to the latest founding round, Linktree had raised $55.7 million in financing. The latest infusion of capital will help the company build more features and find new ways for creators to engage audiences online.

7,721,APPLE,2022-03-16,Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway tell the story of WeWork's descent,"













NEW YORK, March 16 (Reuters) - The rise and fall of office-sharing company WeWork has been turned into a television series with Oscar winners Anne Hathaway and Jared Leto at the helm.

""WeCrashed,"" an eight-part limited series about founders Rebekah and Adam Neumann, will begin streaming on Apple TV + on Friday. The show details the couple’s love story, successes and mistakes.

In 2019, when WeWork first tried to launch an initial public offering with Adam Neumann as chief executive, the proposed share sale imploded spectacularly after investors balked at the company's hefty losses, Neumann's management style and WeWork's corporate governance lapses.

Leto stepped into the role of Adam Neumann, an Israeli businessman, after filming ""House of Gucci,"" about the famous fashion family, and said the transition was challenging.

""Big characters, very, very different characters,"" Leto said. ""Just starting with the accents alone. There was a lot to learn.""

Part of that learning process was a secret meeting with Adam Neumann that was set up without the knowledge of the filmmakers, where Leto offered the businessman advice.

""I said to him, ‘don't ever watch it.’ And which I stand by, you know, I mean, there's no really no – he… first of all, he lived it, why, why, why live through it again? But it's so subjective and a piece like this.""

Hathaway portrays Rebekah Neumann and said she was careful not to ""drag"" or ""judge"" her.

""These are human beings that we're talking about, and to put ourselves in a position of superiority to me is missing the point,"" she said. ""This is an opportunity to understand people.""

Both Leto and Hathaway said they wanted the story to be fair.

""It was important for me not to just be part of a takedown piece, but to really examine the humanity, the complexity of these people,"" Leto said.

8,647,APPLE,2022-03-16,Amazon to divert freight as some Chinese cities go under lockdown,"













March 16 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said it would counter any disruptions due to the lockdowns in Chinese cities by diverting freight to warehouses in unaffected regions, as companies rush to comply with the country's controls to curb the spread of COVID-19.

The e-commerce giant said it had purchased more local inventory during the early outbreak of the Omicron variant to stay better prepared to handle potential disruptions.

Earlier today, Apple (AAPL.O) supplier Foxconn and other companies including Japan's Toyota Motor (7203.T) fueled concerns over how global supply chains could be impacted as China deals with its biggest spike in COVID infections since early 2020.

""We do not anticipate a significant disruption to our business. We are able to counter these closures by diverting available freight to our neighboring warehouses in the region not impacted by COVID lockdown/restrictions,"" Amazon Spokesperson Maria Boschetti said on Wednesday.

Multiple Chinese provinces and cities have tightened restrictions in line with Beijing's zero-tolerance goal of suppressing COVID-19 as quickly as possible, including the southern Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen.

The Shenzhen Cross-border E-commerce Association, which groups about 2,800 retailers using platforms such as Amazon, said its members felt the pain of supply disruptions. read more

The association said there would be some short-term impact on cross-border platforms such as Amazon as goods may not be delivered on time.

The factory shutdowns were also causing delays in deliveries, while logistical difficulties were making it challenging to ship goods to overseas customers, manufacturers in the region said.

Margrethe Vestager, who had proposed the Digital Markets Act more than a year ago with a list of dos and don'ts for U.S. tech giants, said there has been good progress in negotiations.

""We are now aiming to reach political agreement by the fourth trilogue by the end of March. If we manage that, that will be legislation with almost the speed of lightning,"" she told a European Parliament hearing.

Talks are due to resume on March 24.

Issues that need to be ironed out include the list of obligations for online gatekeepers - companies that control data and access to their platforms - and the level of turnover that defines which companies will be covered by the DMA, people close to the matter said.

Another issue is whether the EU executive should be solely responsible for the proposed law's enforcement at the expense of national watchdogs.

Summary Companies Q4 net profit T$44.4 bln vs T$43.32 bln market view

Sees 2022 revenue between -3% to +3%

Restarted some production in Shenzhen

Says to have clarity on supply chain in second half of year

Forecasts annual EV production of up to 750,000 units by 2025















TAIPEI, March 16 (Reuters) - Apple supplier Foxconn forecast an up to 3% fall in revenue for the year in what could be its first annual sales decline in six years, as a shortage of chips squeezes smartphone production and demand cools following a surge during the pandemic.

The Taiwanese company, which had stopped production in China earlier this week to comply with government curbs, said separately that it had restarted some production and operations at its Shenzhen campus after meeting government conditions for staff to live and work in a bubble. read more

The stoppages from Foxconn - the world's largest contract electronics maker - and other companies including Japan's Toyota Motor (7203.T) have fuelled concerns over how global supply chains could be impacted as China deals with its biggest spike in COVID-19 infections since early 2020. read more

Chairman Liu Young-way said on a post-earnings call on Wednesday that Foxconn would only have better clarity on supply chain uncertainty in the second half of the year.

He said the record-high revenue in 2021, boosted by booming electronics demand following the pandemic, would lead to ""stable"" business this year due to a high base last year.

""The pandemic has not eased, inflation is high and global politics are getting tense - these all further complicate supply and demand and lead to great uncertainty to our outlook,"" Liu said, calling 2022 a ""very challenging year"".

Still, Liu said he was ""cautiously positive"" about the company's 2022 sales outlook, citing continuous growth from sectors including 5G smartphones and cloud products.

He had previously warned that he expected the chip shortage to run into the second half of 2022.

Liu said on Wednesday that Foxconn expected limited impact from the war in Ukraine, echoing Taiwan's government which says any impact on the island's supply chains would be small because Russia and Ukraine are not the main import sources of raw materials such as nickel and neon.

Apple has paused all product sales in Russia in response to the invasion, which Russia calls a special military operation.

Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said it expected revenue for the first quarter as well as the year to range between a 3% fall and a 3% rise. Analysts expected revenue this year to rise 1.2%.

The company forecast smartphone revenue to be flat in 2022.

EV PLAN

Foxconn has in recent months announced plans to become a major player in the global electric vehicle (EV) market. On Wednesday, it said it doesn't expect revenue from EVs to be significant until 2023. read more

Foxconn, which has EVs deals with a variety of companies including Lordstown Motors Corp (RIDE.O), forecast an annual production of up to 750,000 units by 2025.

In the fourth quarter ended December, Foxconn's revenue fell 6%, its first decline in five quarters, though still the second-highest for the quarter.

Revenue from its key smart consumer and electronics products business fell between 3% to 15%, in the period. Smartphones account for 60% of this business.

Revenue from its cloud and networking products as well as computing products was flat. Components revenue rose more than 15%.

Foxconn shares closed 0.5% higher ahead of the earnings release, versus a 0.1% gain in the broader market (.TWII). They have fallen 2.4% so far this year.

Net profit fell 3.4% to T$44.4 billion ($1.55 billion) in the October-December period. That compared with the T$43.32 billion average of 10 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.

WASHINGTON, March 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. Homeland Security Department said Thursday it was naming the chief executives of General Motors (GM.N), United Airlines American Airlines , Bank of America (BAC.N), Oracle (ORCL.N) and others to an advisory council.

Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said he was adding 33 members in advance of the council's first meeting set for Monday, which is tasked with helping ""define the department’s strategic vision, strengthen the department to better meet the increasingly dynamic and rapidly evolving threat landscape, and harness technology and innovation to modernize the programs it administers.""

Others being named include the chief executives of Polaris (PII.N), Duke Energy (DUK.N) and Chobani LLC.

Mayorkas told reporters that he picked ""leaders in a diverse array of fields with a diverse breadth of expertise, so that not only can we tap that expertise, but quite frankly, we can hear from them the concerns that they have.""

U.S. airlines have faced international travel restrictions over the past two years over COVID-19 and have been pressing the Biden administration in recent weeks to end requirements for masks on airplanes and to end a requirement that international air passengers get a negative COVID-19 test a day before flying to the United States.

Automakers, including GM, were hit by border disruptions from Canadian trucking protests in February that caused cuts to production in the United States.

Mayorkas said the executives would help the department ""capitalize on the power of technological innovation, and serve our country by living up to our highest ideals.""

The Transportation Security Administration plans to launch a pilot project with Apple to allow people in eight states to add their driver license or state ID to their iPhone and Apple Watch Wallet for use at airport checkpoints.

Other advisory members include former Cabinet secretaries under Democratic and Republican presidents, executive leaders of national law enforcement organizations and non-profit organizations.

13,627,APPLE,2022-03-17,Foxconn to work under COVID bubble in Shenzhen until Sunday - document,"













TAIPEI, March 17 (Reuters) - Major Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier Foxconn (2317.TW) plans to use a COVID bubble arrangement that allowed its Shenzhen campus to resume production until at least Sunday, according to an internal document seen by Reuters.

The world's largest contract electronics maker said on Wednesday it had restarted some production and operations at its Shenzhen campuses after arranging for some staff to live and work in a bubble, an arrangement requested by the local government as it battles the spread of COVID. read more

The ""closed-loop management"" system in its campuses there will last until midnight on Sunday, according to an internal document seen by Reuters and confirmed by two people familiar with the matter.

The company, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, has seen ""limited"" impact so far but some managers are worried about the bubble arrangement extending beyond Sunday as it meant the campus was not working at full production, one of the sources, who's not authorised to speak to the media, said.

Foxconn referred Reuters to its earlier statement, in which the company said it adheres to strict industry guidelines and policies issued by the Shenzhen government.

Only a small part of Foxconn's production for Apple's iPhone production in China takes place in the southern city of Shenzhen, with the majority happening in Zhengzhou in the central province of Henan, the two sources said.

14,652,APPLE,2022-03-17,China's factories opt for isolation bubbles to beat COVID curbs and keep running,"













SHANGHAI/BEIJING, March 17 (Reuters) - To keep factory lines open in the face of COVID curbs Chinese firms are asking workers to eat, sleep and work in bubbles isolated from the wider world, sterilising premises as often as three times a day and testing for COVID daily.

Dubbed ""closed-loop management"", this approach has been part of China's efforts over the past two years to keep local transmission extremely low by global standards.

It was used for example at the Winter Olympics in Beijing to seal event personnel off from the public.

It is now being touted by local Chinese authorities as a solution for companies who want to stay open as the country tackles its biggest outbreak in two years.

Many of the harshest curbs have been applied in manufacturing hubs such as Shenzhen, Dongguan and Changchun, forcing numerous factories to shut.

Apple supplier Foxconn (2317.TW) said it was able to restart some production at its campus in the southern tech hub of Shenzhen after it put such an arrangement in place.

State media outlet Securities Times said on Thursday that television maker TCL Corp (000100.SZ), chip fab Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (0981.HK), and Apple supplier Shenzhen Deren Electronic Co Ltd were keeping factories in affected areas open via closed loop systems.

The companies did not respond to requests for comment.

Tesla is planning a similar arrangement for its Shanghai factory, Reuters reported on Wednesday.

On Thursday, Shenzhen, which has suspended buses, subways and all non-essential economic activity in a week-long containment programme, said it will allow firms to resume work in an ""orderly"" manner. read more

TOUGH REQUIREMENTS

Creating such bubbles, however is not easy. Foxconn said it could only apply the bubble on campuses that included both employee housing and production facilities.

Jin Yong, a factory worker in Shenzhen, told Reuters he had not stepped out of the electronics plant where he works since late February, when they started operating a ""closed-loop"" system for more than 2,000 workers.

While it was slightly depressing to not be able to leave for a walk, he said he felt that it was a good approach to battle COVID.

""We have to take a COVID test every day. And every day we have to maintain a special code showing that we’ve been tested within 24 hours,"" he said, describing the factory site as self-sufficient with a barber shop, canteen and fruit shop. The workers live in dormitories.

Companies also need to strictly follow government guidelines for how to manage staff inside the bubble. A notice from the Dongguan city government on Tuesday said firms had to control the flow of people on their sites to prevent large groups from gathering and to stop people from dining in the canteens.

One industrial zone in Dongguan went a step further by telling firms that they needed to cap the number of workers per 100 square metres at 10 people and sterilize factory floors, elevators and canteens at least three times a day.

But few factories will be able to meet such requirements, said Shenzhen-based Renaud Anjoran, CEO of quality control firm Sofeast Ltd, estimating that only hundreds out of the tens of thousands of factories in Shenzhen would have the resources to conduct closed-loop management.

He was not optimistic, for example, for small plants like his own of about 150 workers that was asked to suspend work on Wednesday evening. He worries losses could amount to ""millions of yuan"" if production stops for more than two weeks.

""At least in 2020 some of the down time was during Chinese New Year, and we were forced to delay the re-opening a bit. This 2022 lockdown is much, much worse for manufacturers.""

BRASILIA, March 18 (Reuters) - Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Friday ordered the suspension of messaging app Telegram, saying it had repeatedly refused to adhere to judicial orders to freeze accounts spreading disinformation or comply with the country's laws, according to a copy of the ruling seen by Reuters.

In response, Telegram founder and CEO Pavel Durov apologized for the company's ""negligence,"" and asked the court to delay its ruling for a few days as it sought to improve compliance.

Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro and his supporters have increasingly relied upon Telegram as a form of mass communication as larger tech companies like Meta (FB.O), which owns messaging app WhatsApp, Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Twitter (TWTR.N) have adhered to Supreme Court orders to drop offending accounts over allegedly spreading disinformation.

Moraes' decision, which is likely to stoke debate about freedom of speech in politically polarized Brazil, represents the latest chapter in the crusading justice's battle with Bolsonaro and his allies.

Moraes has been leading a series of Supreme Court investigations into Bolsonaro and his supporters for disseminating fake news - probes that have enraged many on the right and raised questions about judicial overreach.

Speaking at a religious event in the western state of Acre, Bolsonaro said the court's decision was ""inadmissible.""

According to Moraes' ruling, Telegram had repeatedly failed to block offending accounts and ignored the court's decisions.

Durov, Telegram's founder, blamed his company's shortcomings on email issues, saying, ""we definitely could have done a better job."" Writing on his personal Telegram account, Durov asked the court to delay its ruling.

""I am certain that once a reliable channel of communication is established, we'll be able to efficiently process takedown requests for public channels that are illegal in Brazil,"" he wrote.

Moraes gave Wilson Diniz Wellisch, the head of telecoms regulator Anatel, 24 hours to implement the suspension, which would stand until Telegram complies with outstanding judicial orders, pays a series of fines and presents a country representative before the court.

Moraes also ordered Apple (AAPL.O) and Google to help block users on their platforms from being able to use Telegram in Brazil. Both Apple and Google declined to comment.

Anatel said it had ""forwarded the judicial decision to the entities operating in the regulated sector.""

Moraes' decision quickly faced official opposition.

Writing on Twitter, Justice Minister Anderson Torres criticized Moraes' ""monocratic"" decision, which he said had ""harmed millions of Brazilians."" Torres said he had instructed his ministry to ""study a solution to restore the people's right to use whatever social network they wish.""

Telegram has proved popular with far-right groups worldwide.

In Germany, where local media reported that police in February blocked 64 Telegram channels, the app has been blamed for fueling an increasingly virulent subculture of anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists who exchange news about supposed dangers and arrange protests that have spilled over into violence. read more

In January, Bolsonaro accused the country's top electoral authority of ""cowardice"" for considering a ban of the messaging app amid concerns of its use for spreading ""fake news.""

18,420,APPLE,2022-03-21,Supreme Court rejects Intel bid to challenge rule on patent reviews,"Summary

Summary Law firms Intel petition related to $2.1 billion VLSI chip-patent verdict

Apple, Mylan also fought PTO rule without success















(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied a request by Intel Corp to revive several challenges to the validity of computer-chip patents owned by VLSI Technology LLC, which won over $2.1 billion from Intel last year in a lawsuit over some of the patents.

Intel had asked the high court to overturn a U.S. Patent and Trademark Office rule that has reduced the number of patents reviewed by a PTO tribunal. The Supreme Court rejected similar challenges by Apple Inc and Mylan Laboratories to the same rule earlier this year.

Intel declined to comment. An attorney for VLSI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

VLSI, an affiliate of the SoftBank-owned private equity firm Fortress Investment Group, has sued Intel for allegedly infringing several semiconductor patents in West Texas, Northern California, and Delaware.

A West Texas jury found last March that Intel infringed two VLSI patents and awarded the company over $2.1 billion, marking one of the largest patent awards in U.S. history. A jury in the same court sided with Intel in a second patent trial that April in which VLSI had requested $3.1 billion.

A third West Texas trial is scheduled to start next month.

A California trial is set to begin in 2024. The Delaware court has not yet scheduled a trial.

Intel had challenged several VLSI patents from the court cases in a type of proceeding before the PTO's Patent Trial and Appeal Board known as inter partes review. The board rejected Intel's challenges based on an internal rule that says it should deny review if, among other things, a related court case is closer to trial and has overlapping issues.

Intel argued in its Supreme Court petition that the rule undermines the intended role of inter partes review in improving the patent system's integrity. IPR proceedings are broadly popular with technology companies and others that are often targeted with infringement suits, but less so with inventors and pharmaceutical companies that rely on patent protection to prevent generic competition.

The U.S. government, weighing in on Intel's petition, backed a U.S. appeals court's finding in the case that courts cannot review decisions to deny IPR.

VLSI waived its right to respond to Intel's Supreme Court petition.

The PTO agreed in January to hear a challenge to one of the patents from the $2.1 billion verdict at the request of a South Dakota-based entity called Patent Quality Assurance LLC.

The Supreme Court case is Intel Corp v. VLSI Technology LLC, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 21-888.

19,604,APPLE,2022-03-21,Foxconn 'basically' resumes normal operations in China's Shenzhen,"













TAIPEI, March 21 (Reuters) - Major Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier Foxconn (2317.TW) has ""basically"" resumed normal operations at its most important campuses in the Chinese city of Shenzhen after disruptions caused by COVID-19 outbreaks, the company said on Monday.

The world's largest contract electronics maker said on Wednesday it had restarted some production and operations at its Shenzhen campuses after arranging for some staff to live and work in a bubble, an arrangement requested by the local government as it battles the spread of COVID-19.

The company said in a statement that according to a government notice, it has ""basically resumed normal work order and production operations"" at its major campuses such as in the city's Longhua and Guanlan districts.

This is happening ""under the premise of abiding by epidemic prevention policies and strictly implementing epidemic prevention and control"", it added.

According to an internal company document reviewed by Reuters, employees in the ""high risk"" area of Futian should continue to work from home.

Only a small part of Foxconn's production for Apple's iPhone in China takes place in the southern city of Shenzhen, with the majority happening in Zhengzhou in the central province of Henan, sources have previously said.

20,861,APPLE,2022-03-21,"DraftKings bettors lose appeal over Astros, Red Sox baseball sign-stealing","













NEW YORK, March 21 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Monday rejected an effort by DraftKings fantasy sports bettors to hold Major League Baseball, the Houston Astros and the Boston Red Sox liable for baseball's electronic sign-stealing scandal.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said bettors could not plausibly claim they were defrauded by MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred's comments about the sport's integrity, or the teams' denials that they played dishonestly.

""This action is nothing more than claims brought by disgruntled fantasy sports participants, unhappy with the effect that cheating in MLB games may have had on their level of success in fantasy sports contests,"" Circuit Judge Joseph Bianco wrote for a three-judge panel.

He said a contrary ruling in the proposed class action could open the door for unhappy bettors and ticketholders to sue whenever off-field surprises affect game outcomes.

""When it comes to sports competitions,"" Bianco wrote, ""the one thing that a spectator or consumer can expect is the unexpected.""

Lawyers for DraftKings bettors did not immediately respond to requests for comment. MLB, the Astros, the Red Sox and their lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests or had no immediate comment.

In January 2020, MLB found that the Astros improperly used technology to steal signs from opposing pitchers and catchers in 2017 and 2018, and relayed them -- sometimes by banging trash cans -- to batters so they would know what pitches to expect.

That scandal clouded the Astros' 2017 World Series title and cost Astros manager A.J. Hinch and general manager Jeff Luhnow their jobs.

Manfred separately fined the Red Sox in September 2017 for using an Apple Watch to capture signs from the New York Yankees.

Hinch now manages the Detroit Tigers.

Monday's decision upheld an April 2020 ruling by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan.

It also upheld Rakoff's decision to unseal, over the Yankees' privacy objections, an MLB letter discussing the Red Sox case and the Yankees' improper use of a dugout phone, citing a later MLB press release containing much of that information.

The case is Olson et al v Major League Baseball et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 20-1831, 20-1841.

March 21 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday said Apple Inc (AAPL.O) must face a Silicon Valley company's claims it illegally monopolized the U.S. market for heart rate monitoring apps for its Apple Watch.

U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White said AliveCor Inc, whose SmartRhythm app alerts users to irregular heartbeats, could try to prove that Apple violated federal antitrust law based on its alleged ""complete control"" over the market for such apps.

""AliveCor alleges that Apple made changes to the heart rate algorithm that made it effectively impossible for third parties to inform a user when to take an ECG,"" or electrocardiogram, White wrote. ""Plaintiff's allegations plausibly establish that Apple's conduct was anticompetitive.""

White also dismissed AliveCor's separate claim that Apple maintained an illegal monopoly over ECG-capable smart watches.

The Oakland, California-based judge said this was because AliveCor's KardiaBand wristband, which can record ECGs, ""complements but does not compete"" in that market.

Apple and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Adam Wolfson, a lawyer for AliveCor, declined to comment.

In its May 2021 lawsuit, privately held AliveCor accused Apple of changing the heart rate algorithm for the Apple Watch to gain an ""unfair competitive edge"" over rivals, and ""put countless AliveCor users' lives in danger.""

Apple, based in Cupertino, California, countered that it was an ""uncontroversial proposition that product improvement by itself"" did not violate the federal Sherman antitrust law.

The case is AliveCor Inc v Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 21-03958.

March 21 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) said all its services, including the App Store, Apple TV and Apple Music, have resumed following an outage that started late afternoon on Monday.

Nearly a dozen Apple services were down for thousands of users.

The company's system status page had showed 11 outages including podcasts, music and arcade. It said Apple was investigating the issue and services may be slow or unavailable.

According to outage tracking website Downdetector.com, more than 4,000 users reported issues with accessing Apple Music, while nearly 4,000 reported problems with iCloud.

Users also flagged issues with ""find my iPhone"", Apple store, maps and support.

Downdetector tracks outages by collating status reports from several sources including user-submitted errors on its platform. The outage may be affecting a larger number of users.

The company was responding to affected users on Twitter but it was unclear what caused the outages.

Bloomberg News reported that Apple's corporate staff working from home and retail workers were also facing issues. The outage delayed product repairs, pickups and limited workers' access to internal websites, the report said.

According to the report, Apple told staff that the outage stemmed from domain name system, or DNS - an address book of the internet which enables computers to match website addresses with the correct server.

In a number of incidents last year, DNS issues caused widespread outages on social media platforms including Facebook and Instagram, and brought down websites of airlines and banks for several hours.

23,440,APPLE,2022-03-22,"EU’s faster, harder stick will whack U.S. big tech","













NEW YORK, March 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Regulators around the world have been trying to crack into the dominance that big technology firms like Apple (AAPL.O) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) have created. So far, they have been too slow and toothless to prevent them from growing. Europe’s Digital Markets Act, which might be agreed upon this month read more according to European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager, gets closer to changing that.

Scale creates momentum at technology firms through aspects like networks effects. The more people use a site, like Meta Platforms’ (FB.O) Facebook, for example, the more others want to engage. Often that scale helps profit, too, as upfront costs to penetrate a market with new tech can be high. The payoff comes when a company gains market share and momentum, so tech firms are motivated to push for a monopoly as fast as possible.

Regulators are often behind. They work at a slower pace by nature, but also heading off a monopoly at a tech company before it is established is nearly impossible. And because innovative tech, by definition, is new, regulators are often forced to redefine markets before they can crack down.

So far attempts to dent tech firms’ dominance haven’t worked. Take Alphabet’s fight with the European Commission, which started in 2010. It resulted in nearly $10 billion in fines, but the firm’s operating profit grew seven-fold since that period, to over $300 billion. Moreover, Alphabet has yet to actually pay those fines, and Google retains about 90% of the European search market.

The proposed rules in Europe impose a set of “do and don’t” obligations, like saying companies cannot prefer their own products or services and must allow interoperability with third-party software. The exact limitations and penalties are still under discussion, but firms that break such rules might be fined up to 20% of annual revenue and repeat offenders may be broken up. These are solid threats more damaging than other penalties read more that have been enacted.

Compliance will be costly. If apps become available outside Apple’s store, its margins could fall. Amazon.com’s (AMZN.O) own-label products might see slower expansion, and Alphabet’s users may click away from Google more often.

Yet Europe is a huge market, making up roughly a quarter of revenue at Apple. So companies don’t have the option to walk away. Vestager may ultimately not be able to enforce as stringently as she would like, but she’s getting much closer to cracking big tech’s dominance.

CONTEXT NEWS

- New European Union legislation that reins in the powers of Alphabet’s Google, Amazon.com, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft could be completed by the end of March, European antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on March 16.

- The Digital Markets Act imposes “do and don’t” obligations on so-called “gatekeeper firms” such as saying the companies cannot prefer their own products or services and must allow interoperability with third-party software.

- Issues still under discussion include the thresholds at which firms become gatekeepers, what interoperability entails, and penalties.

- Companies that don’t comply could be fined. The European Parliament has proposed fines ranging from 4% to 20% of worldwide revenue under the Act. Gatekeepers that systematically violate their obligations may be required to divest businesses.

March 22 (Reuters) - Canadian patent-licensing company WiLAN Inc said Tuesday that it has signed a new license agreement with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) related to wireless technology, resolving a patent fight between the companies just weeks after Apple won an appeal of an $85 million court win for WiLAN.

WiLAN's parent company Quarterhill Inc (QTRH.TO) said the agreement settles all court cases between WiLAN, its subsidiary Polaris, and Apple in the United States, Canada and Germany.

Specific terms of the agreement were not disclosed, and the companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Apple sued WiLAN in 2014, seeking a ruling that it did not infringe patents related to allocating bandwidth in a wireless network. WiLAN claimed that iPhone 5 and 6 models infringed by using the LTE wireless standard.

Apple convinced a U.S. appeals court in Washington, D.C., in February to reject the $85 million jury verdict against the iPhone maker because of problems with WiLAN's expert testimony.

The decision was the second time the court had overturned a multi-million dollar verdict for WiLAN in the dispute, after it rejected a $145 million jury win in 2018.

WiLAN's primary business is buyingpatents in fields including wireless communications, computer chips and the automotive industry and licensing the technology to companies.

March 23 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google on Wednesday said it would allow Spotify Technology SA(SPOT.N) to use its own payment system in its Android app as part of a new pilot aimed at countering appmakers' concerns about high fees and allegedly anticompetitive behavior.

Users who have downloaded Spotify from the Google Play Store will be presented with a choice to pay with either Spotify's payment system or with Google Play Billing in some countries in the coming months.

The pilot will allow a small number of participating developers, starting with Spotify, to offer an additional billing option next to Google Play's billing system in their apps.

""This pilot will help us to increase our understanding of whether and how user choice billing works for users in different countries and for developers of different sizes and categories,"" Google said in a blog post.

Under a new competition law in South Korea last year, Google also said it would allow developers to introduce a second payment system alongside its own there.

Spotify said its trial with Google was part of a ""multi-year agreement,"" without elaborating.

App developers such as Spotify that sell digital goods have complained for years about having to use the official payment systems of the Play store and Apple Inc's (AAPL.O)App Store.

Google and Apple collect up to 30% of each payment as a fee, which developers say is too high. Both have lowered fees in many circumstances and have said that they are needed to fund a safe and secure mobile ecosystem.

Google did not specify the fee that it would collect in the new pilot.

The company is ramping up enforcement of its Google Play Billing requirement, and it has said non-compliant apps could be blocked from publishing updates starting on Friday.

March 23 (Reuters) - Major Gulf bourses were mixed on Wednesday as tensions in Ukraine kept oil prices firm, while stocks across Asia rose after investors redirected fund flows from bonds into equities.

Oil prices rose as a reported drop in U.S. crude inventories increased concerns about tight global supplies amid the hit to Russian exports from economic sanctions.

BRUSSELS, March 24 (Reuters) - Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google, Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Meta (FB.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) may have to change their core business practices in Europe as EU countries and EU lawmakers on Thursday clinched a deal on landmark rules to curb their powers.

France, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said in a tweet that there was a provisional agreement after eight hours of talks.

EU industry chief Thierry Breton said in a tweet that the deal would ensure fair and open digital markets.

""What we want is simple: fair markets also in digital. Large gatekeeper platforms have prevented businesses and consumers from the benefit of competitive digital markets,"" EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, who proposed the rules just over a year ago, said in a statement.

""This means that the time of long antitrust cases, during which the authorities were lagging behind the big tech companies, is over,"" said EU lawmaker Andreas Schwab, who had steered the debate in the European Parliament.

The Digital Markets Act (DMA) sets out rules for online gatekeepers - companies that control data and platform access.

It will cover gatekeepers in online intermediation services, social networks, search engines, operating systems, online advertising services, cloud computing, video-sharing services, web browsers and virtual assistants.

Under the DMA, the tech giants will have to make their messaging services interoperable and provide business users access to their data. Business users would be able to promote competing products and services on a platform and reach deals with customers off the platforms.

The rules prohibit the companies from favoring their own services over rivals' or preventing users from removing pre-installed software or apps.

The DMA will apply to companies with a market capitalisation of 75 billion euros, 7.5 billion euros in annual turnover and at least 45 million monthly users.

Companies face hefty fines up to 10% of their annual global turnover for breaching the rules and as much as 20% for repeat offences.

Apple, which has lobbied intensively against the DMA, reiterated its worries.

""We remain concerned that some provisions of the DMA will create unnecessary privacy and security vulnerabilities for our users while others will prohibit us from charging for intellectual property in which we invest a great deal,"" it said in a statement.

Google, which also cranked up its lobbying in the last year, echoed the same sentiments.

""While we support many of the DMA's ambitions around consumer choice and interoperability, we're worried that some of these rules could reduce innovation and the choice available to Europeans. We'll now take some time to study the final text, talk with the regulator and work out what we need to do to comply,"" it said in a statement.

Summary Law firms

Law firms Related documents Qualcomm patent relates to increasing telecom data rates

Qualcomm previously sued Apple over same patent















(Reuters) - Intel Corp convinced a U.S. appeals court on Thursday to cancel parts of a Qualcomm Inc telecommunications patent, reversing a patent tribunal's decision.

The ruling by the Washington, D.C.-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit comes three years after Intel challenged parts of the Qualcomm patent, which relates to receiving wireless communications over multiple carrier signals.

The technology can help communications systems reach higher maximum rates for transmitting data.

Intel argued that the invention could not be patented because it had been publicly disclosed in an earlier, unrelated patent application and a technical report by a telecommunications-standard group.

A three-judge Federal Circuit panel agreed, reversing a decision by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's Patent Trial and Appeal Board.

Qualcomm had previously sued Apple Inc for infringing the same patent and other chip-related patents. Qualcomm and Apple settled their patent dispute in 2019.

Intel declined to comment on Thursday's decision. Qualcomm and its attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The case is Intel Corp v. Qualcomm Inc, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, No. 20-2092.

OAKLAND, Calif., March 24 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Thursday told appellate judges that video game maker Epic Games had failed to show any legal error that would justify them overturning a lower-court ruling that found key App Store policies do not break U.S. antitrust law.

Epic, known for its ""Fortnite"" game, largely lost a trial last year over whether Apple's payment rules for apps were anticompetitive. That decision found Apple had suitable reasons to force some app makers such as Epic to use its payment system and take commissions of 15% to 30% on their sales.

Following the ruling, Epic appealed in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Apple in its reply on Thursday said Epic had failed to propose a reasonable alternative to the App Store policies.

""Epic asks the Judiciary to fundamentally change the App Store by forcing Apple to abandon the integrated distribution and digital-content delivery model that, among many other procompetitive benefits, helps safeguard user security and privacy,"" the court filing said.

Both Apple and Epic are scheduled to file a second round of arguments before the appeals panel calls a hearing, for possibly next year.

In support of Epic's appeal, attorneys general for 34 U.S. states and the District of Columbia said in January that Apple is stifling competition through its mobile app store. read more

Outside arguments in support of Apple are due next Thursday.

Experts and critics of the lower-court decision have said it is striking that the judge found Apple had broken California's unfair competition law but not federal antitrust law.

Similarly, Apple in its cross-appeal on Thursday questioned how it could be held liable under state law if its practices were not found illegal under federal law.

March 24 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) said it has resolved the issues that caused outages to its iMessage service after complaints earlier on Thursday, as the tech behemoth grappled with disruptions to its cloud services for the third time this week.

User reports complaining of iMessage outages on Downdetector.com started climbing shortly after 4:20 p.m. ET, and later hit over 1,100.

Apple was hit with similar outages earlier this week that knocked off services like its mobile App Store and music streaming service. read more

The company did not respond to a request for comment on the reasons for the recent outages.

Apple's corporate staff working from home and retail workers also faced tech issues on Monday due to domain name system (DNS) issues, according to Bloomberg News.

In a number of incidents last year, issues with DNS - an address book of the internet which enables computers to match website addresses with the correct server, caused widespread outages on social media platforms including Facebook and Instagram, and brought down websites of airlines and banks for several hours.

32,265,APPLE,2022-03-24,Apple to buy first large batch of carbon-free aluminum for iPhone SE,"













March 24 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) said on Thursday it will buy its first industrial-size batch of carbon-free aluminum to use in its low-cost iPhone SE, as it steps up efforts to reduce carbon footprint from the metal it uses heavily in product casings.

Details about the size or cost of the purchase were not disclosed.

The iPhone maker has been taking steps to reduce its use of the carbon-intensive metal that emits direct greenhouse gases from the smelting process and has spiked consumer, activist and investor dissent due to its environmental impact.

Apple first bought a smaller batch of the lab-made metal in 2019 from Elysis, a Montreal-based joint venture between two of the world's biggest aluminum suppliers - Alcoa Corp and Rio Tinto. It had used the metal in its 16-inch MacBook Pro.

Elysis had originally planned to commercialize its technology, which uses a ceramic anode to make aluminum and emits only oxygen, by 2024.

33,321,APPLE,2022-03-24,Alphabet fiddles as app-store antitrust fire burns,"













LONDON, March 24 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) is gesturing in the right direction by slowly opening up its app store. Yet the changes are unlikely to appease angry governments. The $1.8 trillion company and $2.8 trillion rival Apple (AAPL.O) will have to go further.

The search giant said on Wednesday that it would let Spotify Technology (SPOT.N) use its own billing system for users who subscribe to the music-streaming service through the Google Play store. Apple and Google have historically locked developers into using their payment services for in-app purchases, charging a hefty 15% to 30% fee.

The Big Tech duo justify those fees by pointing to all the money they’ve spent building the popular app stores, which are otherwise free to use. On the other hand, critics call it monopolistic price gouging. Epic Games, for example, sued Apple for “anticompetitive conduct” read more . Spotify launched a similar European complaint.

Google’s move piles pressure on Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook. The iPhone maker probably has more to lose: consumers spent $85 billion through its app store in 2021, according to Sensor Tower, compared with Google’s $48 billion. The search giant’s core business is advertising; giving some ground on payment fees allows it to look good while throwing dirt at Apple.

But there’s plenty to dislike in Google’s gambit. First, it’s just a pilot project open to a “small number of participating developers”, including Spotify. It’s far from clear that all apps will eventually have carte blanche to use their chosen payment system.

Second, Spotify will probably still have to surrender some revenue. In South Korea, where lawmakers forced app stores to offer alternative payment services, Google is charging app developers 11%. That’s barely better than the default 15%. In the Netherlands, Apple responded to a regulatory order covering dating apps by allowing third-party payments but charging a whopping 27% fee.

In essence, the duo tend to replace one exorbitant charge with a slightly less exorbitant one. That won’t pass muster with European legislators, who are preparing to thwack them with new rules in the Digital Markets Act read more . Attorneys general for 34 U.S. states and the District of Columbia said in January that Apple was stifling competition, effectively siding with “Fortnite” maker Epic in its legal tussle with the iPhone maker read more . The app store fight is ramping up. Google’s fiddling is just a prelude.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Alphabet’s Google said on March 23 that it would allow Spotify Technology to offer its own payment system in its Android app as part of a new pilot.

- Users who have downloaded Spotify from the Google Play store will be presented with a choice to pay either with Spotify’s payment system or with Google Play Billing.

- The pilot will allow a small number of participating developers, starting with Spotify, to offer an additional third-party billing option next to Google Play’s billing system in their apps.

34,607,APPLE,2022-03-25,Analysis: New EU rules regulating U.S. tech giants likely to set global standard,"













BRUSSELS, March 25 (Reuters) - Landmark EU rules targeting Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Meta (FB.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) are likely to set a global benchmark and may even force changes in the tech giants' business models, lawyers and experts said.

Europe's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager on Thursday won backing from European Union members and EU lawmakers for her proposal, the Digital Markets Act (DMA), to rein in the powers of the tech giants via legislation for the first time, rather than lengthy antitrust investigations. read more

The DMA sets out a list of dos and don'ts targeting each tech giant's core business practices.

""DMA is here to stay and will be quickly mirrored in a number of countries. The flexibility that big tech had will be constrained, as the regulatory 'straitjacket' will get tighter globally,"" said Ioannis Kokkoris, competition law professor at Queen Mary University in London.

Vestager's switch to legislation came amid frustration over slow-moving antitrust investigations that deliver remedies criticised by rivals as inadequate, with Google often cited as an example despite being hit with more than 8 billion euros ($8.8 billion) in fines.

The new rules may even spur tech giants to rethink their strategy on long-term goals and swap their business models for others.

""If it succeeds, the DMA will put pressure on monopoly rents of gatekeepers in tipped markets, thereby encouraging them to move towards more long term innovation targets,"" said Nicolas Petit, professor of competition law at the European University Institute in Florence.

""I think the DMA indirectly places a premium on business models based on subscriptions or device level monetisation. We might see more (increased) prices, and vertical integration into hardware in the future,"" he said.

Still, enforcing the DMA will require a bigger team than the small group planned by the European Commission, said Thomas Vinje, a partner at law firm Clifford Chance in Brussels who has advised rivals in cases against Microsoft, Google and Apple.

""The Commission suggested upon proposing the DMA that it would be enforced by a team of 80 people. This will not be enough to enable effective enforcement,"" he said.

""Another big question is who in the Commission will enforce it. Only DG COMP (competition officials) has the technical and industry knowledge and experience dealing with such companies to effectively enforce the DMA. If others in the Commission, such as DG Connect (digital officials), are to enforce the DMA, it will be a dead letter.""

The DMA is just the first step towards making sure that tech giants play fair, said Alec Burnside, a partner at law firm Dechert in Brussels.

""The DMA is not a perfectly formed panacea from the start, and without doubt gatekeepers will try to navigate around it. Rome was not built in a day, nor was the highway code perfect when first conceived,"" he said.

""New rules of the road for the digital economy will be shaped over the period ahead, and the DMA is a crucially important first step.""

There may be some wiggle room for the tech giants to dodge the full impact of the DMA, said Kokkoris.

""The degree of adverse impact on big tech will depend on the extent they can persuade the Commission of the lack of any anti-competitive effect,"" he.

35,10,APPLE,2022-03-25,"Apple closes Russian Mir card loophole for Apple Pay, says Sberbank","













March 25 (Reuters) - U.S. tech giant Apple (AAPL.O) has suspended its Apple Pay service for Russia's Mir card payment system, Russia's largest lender and payments system said on Friday, closing a loophole that had allowed Russians to keep using the service.

Apple Inc restricted the use of Apple Pay, which began operating in Russia in 2016, on March 1 in the wake of Russia's decision to send tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, preventing Russian Mastercard (MA.N) and Visa (V.N) cardholders using the service.

But Russia's home-grown system, Mir, remained connected to Apple Pay until that access was removed on Thursday, according to Russia's National Card Payment System (NSPK).

""Apple has informed NSPK it is suspending support for Mir cards in the Apple Pay payment service. Starting from March 24, users cannot add new Mir cards to the service. Apple will stop all operations of previously added cards over the next few days,"" NSPK said on Friday.

Russia's dominant lender, Sberbank (SBER.MM), said that Apple, which did not respond to Reuters requests for comment, had informed the bank of its decision to further restrict access to its Apple Pay service.

""Further use of Mir cards in Apple Pay will not be available,"" the bank said.

37,251,APPLE,2022-03-25,EXCLUSIVE Apple has not fully complied with order to open up App Store -Dutch watchdog,"













BRUSSELS, March 25 (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) is set to be hit with another fine next week for not fully complying with an order to open its App Store to rival forms of payment for dating apps in the Netherlands, Dutch antitrust watchdog ACM told Reuters.

The iPhone maker has already racked up 45 million euros ($49 million) in penalties to date as ACM (Authority for Consumers and Markets) has slapped weekly 5 million euro fines on the company since January, with the ninth penalty handed out this week.

Apple submitted a fresh proposal to the ACM this week in a bid to halt the sanction. The offer does not fully comply with its order, an official at the Dutch watchdog, who did not wish to be identified, told Reuters on Friday.

Subsequent fines once the total penalty hits 50 million euros could be higher according to ACM rules.

Apple, which requires developers to use its system and pay commissions of 15-30% on digital goods purchases and is feeling regulatory scrutiny worldwide over this, was not immediately available for comment.

An investigation by ACM on whether Apple's practices amounted to an abuse of a dominant market position was launched in 2019. It was later reduced in scope to focus primarily on dating market apps, including Tinder owner Match Group Inc (MTCH.O). read more

ACM says Apple abuses its market dominance and has ordered it to change this practice. Apple has denied market abuse.

Under tough new rules agreed on Thursday between the European Commission, EU governments and EU lawmakers, Apple will be required to open up its App Store once the legislation comes into force in October. read more

38,867,APPLE,2022-03-28,"Deal on rules forcing tech giants to police content possible in April, EU's Vestager says","













BRUSSELS, March 28 (Reuters) - A deal between EU countries and EU lawmakers that would require tech giants to do more to police content on their platforms could be agreed next month, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Monday.

Vestager proposed the Digital Services Act, (DSA) which forces tech giants to do more to tackle illegal content or risk fines up to 6% of their global turnover, just over a year ago.

EU countries and EU lawmakers are now thrashing out the details, with debate over the definition of an online marketplace subject to the rules and the criteria for banning targeted advertisements.

""There is a very strong momentum to get things done. And the leadership of the French presidency may allow us to finalise the Digital Services Act before the end of April. But if we work hard, and we're lucky, it may be possible,"" Vestager told Reuters in an interview.

Vestager last week secured the green light from EU countries and EU lawmakers for her other landmark proposal, called the Digital Markets Act (DMA), targeting Google (GOOGL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Meta (FB.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O). read more

The DMA sets out a list of dos and don'ts and gives companies designated as online gatekeepers, which control access and data on their platforms, six months to comply with the rules. Businesses, however, say that is too short for such complex legislation.

Vestager said there would be no extension as companies are aware of what constitutes anti-competitive practices.

""Well, actually both I think we in our work and the companies should be very happy that we have six months because it was one of the things that were intensively discussed during the negotiations,"" she said.

""And since both the prohibitions and the obligations are things that come from established case law, I don't think any of them are sort of big surprises.""

Asked whether the DMA would cover non-U.S. tech giants, Vestager said: ""It's likely but I don't know.""

Observers said booking.com and Alibaba (9988.HK) may fall under the new rules.

March 28 (Reuters) - A day after superstar Will Smith slapped comedian Chris Rock minutes before accepting the best actor Oscar at the 94th Academy Awards, Hollywood power brokers remained publicly silent even as celebrities criticized the attack on social media.

The lack of a reaction is a testament to Smith's broad popularity in Hollywood, and his powerful box office cachet, according to some observers.

On Monday, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which gives out the Oscars and has 9,900 members from actors and directors to costume designers and cinematographers, condemned the attack and said it is conducting a formal review, and ""will explore further action.""

These actions could include revoking Smith's Oscar or expelling him from the academy, according to the group's standards of conduct.

But Hollywood is unlikely to altogether abandon Smith, 53, one of its most bankable stars, said industry insiders.

""The current attitude, I believe, is that the studio(s) want all this to go away as if it never happened,"" said one seasoned Hollywood dealmaker.

Another executive predicted the controversy would blow over, noting, ""He's a talented guy at the top of his game ... This will be a blip and won't matter long- or even short-term.""

Smith, who apologised to Rock in a statement on social media on Monday, has anchored such lucrative film franchises as ""Bad Boys,"" ""Independence Day"" and ""Men in Black."" His films, both live-action and animated, have grossed more than $9 billion globally, according to box office researcher Comscore. read more

The musician and actor rose to prominence as the twentysomething star of the 1990s NBC sitcom ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"" a show that lasted six seasons. It helped launch his film career as an irreverent action hero, and later, his work as a producer of films and series.

Smith's producing credits include ""Cobra Kai,"" the Netflix (NFLX.O) series inspired by the 1980s action film ""The Karate Kid,"" and the film for which he received the lead actor Oscar, ""King Richard,"" about the father of tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams.

In a sign of his enduring appeal with audiences, in July 2020, Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) Apple TV+ paid a reported $120 million for ""Emancipation,"" an action thriller about a slave on the run from the Confederacy, and Netflix greenlit a sequel to the 2017 urban fantasy epic, ""Bright,"" in 2018. Both star Smith.

The Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) announced in February it would send Smith to both ends of the earth for a National Geographic series called ""Pole to Pole,"" for its Disney+ streaming service.

Netflix, Disney and Apple did not reply to requests for comment. Kevin Mayer, co-CEO of Candle Media, the Blackstone-backed (BX.N) firm that earlier this year took a minority stake in Will and Jada Pinkett Smith's media company, Westbrook Inc, declined to comment.

Smith's influence has expanded beyond Hollywood into Silicon Valley, where he is a co-founder of venture capital firm Dreamers VC, which has invested in a long list of startups including Andreessen Horowitz-backed electric boat startup Arc Boat, social investing network Public.com, and Elon Musk's tunneling firm, The Boring Company.

40,29,APPLE,2022-03-28,"Apple to cut iPhone, AirPods output, Nikkei reports","













March 28 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is planning to lower iPhone and AirPod production due to a demand slowdown caused by the Ukraine crisis and rising inflation, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Monday, citing sources briefed on the matter.

The company plans to produce 20% fewer iPhone SEs - or about 2 million to 3 million units - next quarter than originally planned, the report said. It added that Apple has also reduced 2022 orders for AirPods by more than 10 million units.

Apple, whose shares were down about 2% in premarket trading, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The news of weaker demand mirrors forecasts from analysts who have warned that COVID-19 lockdowns in Chinese cities and a surge in inflation due to the Ukraine conflict could hurt smartphone demand this year.

[1/2] The new iPhone SE is seen on display during an event at the Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California March 21, 2016. REUTERS/Stephen Lam 1 2

Apple, in particular, faces challenges from the lack of a design upgrade for the latest SE and a $30 increase in its price from the 2020 model, analysts have said.

Ming-Chi Kuo at TF International Securities on Monday slashed his shipment estimate for iPhone SE this year to between 15 million and 20 million units, from 25 million to 30 million units previously.

""It looks very similar to the iPhone SE (2020), a second refurbishment of the iPhone 8, and it is even less likely to arouse consumer demand,"" Taiwan-based Isaiah Research analyst Eddie Han said, cutting his forecast sales for the model by 5 million units.

Apple is expected to launch a brand new iPhone lineup later this year, but analysts say it was too early to forecast any impact on the upcoming range.

March 27 (Reuters - Apple TV+ (AAPL.O) made history on Sunday as the first streaming service to win a best picture Oscar for ""CODA,” a heartwarming drama about the daughter of deaf parents who pursues her passion for music.

The streaming service purchased ""CODA"" for a record $25 million following its debut in 2021 at the Sundance Film Festival, and it has gathered momentum throughout the awards season, winning top honors from the Producers Guild, Screen Actors Guild and Writers Guild awards.

""CODA"" faced intense competition from Netflix's critically acclaimed western, ""The Power of the Dog,"" which collected a dozen nominations. The film's director, Jane Campion, received an Academy Award.

The best picture Oscar signals how far the industry has come since 2017, when the Cannes film festival prohibited movies that were not released on the big screen from competing for its most prestigious prize, the Palme d’Or. It was a deliberate snub to streaming services like Netflix (NFLX.O).

As the global pandemic forced theaters to close in 2020, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences modified its Oscar eligibility rules to temporarily change the requirement that a movie screen for seven days in theaters to qualify. That represented a watershed moment for movies that debut via streaming services in the home.

The best picture Oscar also marks a milestone for Apple TV+, which launched in November 2019 with a handful of original series and no library of movies and TV shows.

Apple TV+ saw a breakthrough in September 2021, when its fish-out-of-water comedy, ""Ted Lasso,"" about an American football coach who takes a job with an English soccer club, received the Emmy Award for outstanding comedy series.

""If Apple was to win the coveted best picture award with CODA it would catalyze more A+ talent coming to Apple first (or in the top bracket)"" and boost subscriptions, Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives wrote before the awards.

42,679,APPLE,2022-03-28,"Will Smith apologizes to Chris Rock for slap, academy weighs action","













LOS ANGELES, March 28 (Reuters) - Will Smith apologized to Chris Rock on Monday for slapping the comedian at Sunday night's Oscars ceremony, issuing a statement after the film academy said it might take action against Smith for an incident that overshadowed the industry's top awards.

Smith, in a post on Instagram, said his behavior at the televised ceremony was ""unacceptable and inexcusable.""

""I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris,"" Smith wrote. ""I was out of line and I was wrong.""

Smith strode on stage and struck Rock in the face after the comedian made a joke about the appearance of Smith's wife. Less than an hour later, Smith won best actor for his role as the father of tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams in ""King Richard.""

Rock, in a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith, had referenced the 1997 film ""G.I. Jane"" in which actress Demi Moore shaved her head. It was unclear whether Rock was aware that Smith's wife has a disease that causes hair loss.

""Jokes at my expense are part of the job,"" Smith said on Monday, ""but a joke about Jada's medical condition was too much for me to bear and I reacted emotionally.""

""I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be,"" he added.

Earlier Monday, the 9,900-member Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences condemned Smith's actions and said it was reviewing the matter.

""We have officially started a formal review around the incident and will explore further action and consequences in accordance with our Bylaws, Standards of Conduct and California law,"" the academy added.

The group's conduct policy states it is ""opposed to any form of abuse, harassment or discrimination"" and expects members to uphold the values ""of respect for human dignity, inclusion, and a supportive environment that fosters creativity.""

Violations may result in suspension or expulsion from the organization, revocation of Oscars, or loss of eligibility for future awards, according to the policy.

SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents actors, called the Smith's actions ""unacceptable"" and said it had been in touch with the academy and broadcaster ABC ""to ensure this behavior is appropriately addressed.""

It is rare but not unprecedented for the film academy to revoke membership. Producer Harvey Weinstein was expelled in 2017 after more than three dozen women accused him of sexual assault.

In his statement, Smith also apologized to the academy, show producers, attendees, viewers, the Williams family and ""my King Richard family.""

Studio executives were publicly silent about Smith on Monday. The 53-year-old actor has projects in the works with Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Apple TV+ (AAPL.O). The companies did not respond to requests for comment. read more

One of Hollywood's most bankable stars, Smith has anchored lucrative film franchises such as ""Independence Day"" and ""Men in Black."" His films have grossed more than $9 billion at global box offices, according to researcher Comscore.

Oscars producers had been hoping for a memorable night on Sunday to rebound from record-low ratings during the COVID-19 pandemic. They brought in three hosts, opened the show with Beyonce and shortened some acceptance speeches.

But it was Smith's outburst that went viral, with pictures and video ricocheting across social media.

Television viewership jumped sharply this year, to an average of 15.36 million people, a 56% boost from 2021, according to preliminary estimates.

Feel-good movie ""CODA"" won best picture, marking a turning point in Hollywood because the film was streamed by Apple TV+ (AAPL.O) rather than debuting exclusively to theaters.

Many Hollywood celebrities denounced Smith's actions. read more

""Will Smith owes Chris Rock a huge apology. There is no excuse for what he did,"" filmmaker Rob Reiner said on Twitter.

Others supported Smith for defending his wife.

""That's what your husband is supposed to do, right? Protect you,"" comedian Tiffany Haddish told People magazine.

March 30 (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger earned 1,711 times as much as the average worker at the U.S. chipmaker in just 11 months since he joined in February last year, a regulatory filing showed on Wednesday.

Compared to Gelsinger, former CEO Bob Swan had earned 217 times more than the average Intel employee in 2020.

Gelsinger earned $178.6 million in 2021 with stock awards making up nearly 79% of his total compensation, which was about 698% higher than Swan's 2020 pay.

Executive pay has been rising in the United States. Apple Inc (AAPL.O) CEO Tim Cook earned 1,447 times the average employee's salary at the tech giant in 2021. Shareholders of Apple approved the pay package despite proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services pushing against it.

Intel has asked shareholders to vote in favor of its executives' compensation at the annual stockholder's meeting on May 12. It did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

After Gelsinger took the reins at Intel, once a world leader in chip-making technology, he unveiled a turnaround strategy for the company to regain its dominance in the semiconductor industry, currently led by Taiwan's Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW).

Intel's shares rose 6.8% last year after declining about 17% the year before as the company faced a manufacturing crisis and struggled with competition. The shares were up 0.3% at $52.41 on Wednesday.

Earlier this month, Intel laid out the first details of a $88 billion investment plan spanning across six European Union countries including a massive investment in Germany. read more

Gelsinger was CEO of VMWare Inc (VMW.N) before he returned to Intel as its top boss. He had spent 30 years at Intel before leaving.

His compensation included one-time new-hire equity awards with a target value of about $110 million, according to the filing.

44,878,APPLE,2022-03-30,"Amazon gets rare 'underperform' rating on risks from higher expenses, inflation","













March 30 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) received a rare ""underperform"" rating from BNP Paribas Exane on Wednesday, with the French brokerage saying the e-commerce giant faces a bumpy ride ahead due to surging inflation and higher expenses.

Analyst Stefan Slowinski said investments during the COVID-19 pandemic to build fulfillment centers for faster deliveries and employee bonuses to keep its warehouses staffed in a tight U.S. labor market may eat into the company's margins.

He added that capital expenditure could grow in the mid-teens, initiating with a price target of $2,800.

Amazon's shares were down about 1% at $3,354 in early trading in a weak broader market.

Of the 58 brokerages covering Amazon, 20 rate the stock ""strong buy"", 36 ""buy"", one ""hold"" and one ""sell"", according to Refinitiv data. The median price target is $4,000.

Amazon boomed during the pandemic as consumers were highly dependent on online shopping for everyday essentials, but those shoppers are now returning to stores.

Customers are also cutting back on discretionary spending in a highly inflationary environment, at a time when costs of raw materials, procurement and shipping are rising for companies.

""While margin expansion is possible, clearly with high inflation the consumer is under pressure... Amazon is already increasing prices on their customers by increasing their Prime pricing,"" Slowinski said.

He added that Amazon would not raise pricing on many products to match inflation and would probably take a hit.

The company would need to allocate capital expenditure for its cloud business, as it aims to expand footprint by about 30% in a competitive market, he said.

The stock is up 1.6% as of Tuesday's close, after tumbling as much as 20% during the selloff earlier this year.

Peers in the $1 trillion and larger club, Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O), have declined 6% and 1.6% ,respectively. Apple has gained 0.8% and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) has added 4%.

45,588,APPLE,2022-03-30,Japan Display unveils tech to extend smartwatch battery life,"













TOKYO, March 30 (Reuters) - Japan Display (6740.T) on Wednesday said it planned to begin production of new display panel components it says can significantly lower power consumption and extend the battery life of smart watches and other consumer electronics.

The maker of small displays used in smartphones, cars and other products is in ""discussions with multiple customers and plans to start mass production from 2024,"" the company, which counts Apple Inc (AAPL.O) among its biggest customers, said in a news release.

Japan Display, which expect an operating loss of 11.3 billion yen ($93 million) in the year ending March 31, has struggled amid tough competition and as customers shift to organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays. More recently, it has had to curb production because of semiconductor shortages.

Covered in tiny transistors, the component, known as a backplane, makes up one of the layers in a LCD. They are also used in OLED panels.

Japan Display says its new backplane consume as much as 40% less power than conventional components and also improves screen resolution making it suitable for virtual realty devices.

The company said it expects the new display component to generate 50 billion yen ($411 million) in sales annual within five years.

46,640,APPLE,2022-03-30,Russia approves 'parallel imports' after top brands halt sales,"













March 30 (Reuters) - Russia has authorised retailers to import products from abroad without the trademark owner's permission, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said on Wednesday, after global brands halted sales or stopped exports over Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine.

Russia's retail sector has been upended by Western economic sanctions and decisions by firms such as H&M, Apple and Nike to curb their activity in Russia.

Speaking at a televised government meeting, Mishustin said ""parallel imports"" were needed to ensure that certain goods could continue to be shipped to Russia.

""This approach will guarantee the shipment of goods to our country, ... in spite of the unfriendly actions of foreign politicians,"" he said.

Which goods can be imported to Russia in this way will be determined by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Mishustin added.

The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS), which had prepared draft regulations on parallel imports, said the measure ""will develop competition between brands through an increase in the number of businesses that import goods to Russia, which will lead to a decrease in retail prices for these goods"".

Russia, which faces its deepest economic crisis in more than two decades owing to an unprecedented barrage of Western sanctions over the Ukraine conflict, has proposed a raft of support measures to buttress its economy.

Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists.

Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance, and the West hopes the sanctions it has imposed will force Russia to withdraw.

BRUSSELS, March 31 (Reuters) - Regulators are looking to update rules, which target companies abusing their market power and those setting up illegal cartels, to make them more efficient, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Thursday.

Under the rules, known as Regulation 1/2003 and in force since 2004, the European Commission has taken on Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta (FB.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Intel (INTC.O) and imposed billions of euros in fines.

The rules have also allowed the EU competition enforcer to go after car parts cartels, banks' manipulation of financial benchmarks and other illegal price-fixing groups, putting the EU agency in the forefront of antitrust enforcement.

The Commission wants to maintain its leading position, Vestager said.

""I'm announcing today that in the coming months we are going to launch an evaluation of Regulation 1/2003, the central plank of our antitrust enforcement framework,"" Vestager told a conference organised by economic consultancy CRA.

""It is important that we hear the views of stakeholders concerning what has worked well, and where there is scope for more efficient and effective procedures and enforcement tools; making sure Regulation 1 is truly 'fit for the digital age',"" she said.

Vestager said the updated rules would seek to make them more operational and useful to businesses.

Such procedural changes would relate to requests for information sent to companies, dawn raids, oral hearings where companies seek to defend their cases and the 10% cap on fines levied for breach of rules or non-compliance.

48,79,APPLE,2022-03-31,Apple Pay push is scarier for fintechs than banks,"













LONDON, March 31 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apple (AAPL.O) is taking a bite out of the financial-technology sector. Digital upstarts like Affirm (AFRM.O) and Jack Dorsey’s Block (SQ.N) should be on high alert. Lenders like Goldman Sachs (GS.N), however, have less to fear.

The $2.9 trillion iPhone maker led by Tim Cook is beefing up its in-house financial-services infrastructure and expanding further in consumer credit, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday. That involves bringing a raft of tools such as payment processing and credit-risk assessment in-house. Cook is also launching a “buy now, pay later” product that will allow consumers to spread the cost of purchases over instalments.

The push is scariest for Apple’s current financial-technology suppliers. Shares in CoreCard (CCRD.N) and Green Dot (GDOT.N), whose systems underpin the company’s credit card and peer-to-peer payment offering, fell by 12% and 5% respectively on Wednesday. That’s a fair reaction, since Cook seems intent on controlling his fintech infrastructure. He recently bought Credit Kudos, a UK startup whose technology could allow Apple to supplement conventional credit checks by accessing borrowers’ bank-account history.

Cook’s consumer-credit expansion should also worry pay-later players like $13 billion Affirm, Klarna and Afterpay, which Block bought for $29 billion. Apple Pay has almost 50 million U.S. users, according to eMarketer, giving it a formidable starting point from which to launch a pay-by-instalment product. Cook recently announced a new service allowing U.S. merchants to accept payments from customers just using an iPhone. That’s a direct threat to Block’s core business.

The trickier question is whether banks like JPMorgan (JPM.N), Goldman Sachs and Bank of America (BAC.N) should fret. Bloomberg reported that Apple could fund smaller pay-later loans using its own balance sheet rather than using a partner like Goldman, as it does for credit cards.

But it’s hard to imagine Cook cutting out the lenders entirely. Apple’s financial resources are huge: it had $203 billion of cash and marketable securities at the end of 2021. However, that’s tiny compared with the size of big U.S. banks’ balance sheets, which are comfortably in the trillions. And large-scale consumer lending isn’t lucrative enough to justify the regulatory hassle. Barclays’ (BARC.L) consumer, cards and payments business has generated an average return on equity of 16% since 2014, after stripping out intangible assets. Apple’s RoE this year will exceed 100%, according to Refinitiv estimates. Banks’ chief executives and Cook can probably get along.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Apple is developing its own financial-services technology in a bid to reduce the company’s reliance on third-party systems, Bloomberg reported on March 30.

- Under the plans, the iPhone maker would manage its own payments processing, risk assessment for loans, fraud analysis and credit checks.

- The first product to rely on the new technology systems will be a “buy now, pay later” service with two distinct offerings.

- The first offering would provide interest-free credit so that consumers can split purchases across four instalments. Apple might fund those loans using its own cash reserves, Bloomberg reported. The second product would offer longer-term consumer loans underwritten by Goldman Sachs, Apple’s existing credit card partner.

March 31 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is exploring new suppliers for memory chips used in its iPhones, including a potentially first Chinese supplier, after a key Japanese partner had an output disruption, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing sources.

Japan-based Kioxia Holdings Corp — a key supplier of flash memory chips to Apple — had reported a contamination last month at two of its manufacturing facilities, which the company said will result in reduced production. read more

Apple is now testing sample NAND flash memory chips by Chinese semiconductor company Yangtze Memory Technologies Co, the report said, adding that the iPhone maker has been discussing the tie-up for months.

Yangtze declined to comment and Apple did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for a comment on the report.

Earlier this month, another key Apple supplier Foxconn had to suspend its Shenzhen operations due to a spike in COVID-19 cases. read more

A persistent industry-wide shortage of chips has also disrupted production in the automotive and electronics industries, forcing some firms to scale back production.

50,500,APPLE,2022-03-31,Gary Oldman leads team of failed spies in thriller series ‘Slow Horses’,"













LONDON, March 31 (Reuters) - New Apple TV+ series ""Slow Horses"" offers a less glamorous take on the British secret services, centring around a group of bored MI5 misfits.

The show stars Oscar-winner Gary Oldman in the role of Jackson Lamb, a quick-witted but ill-mannered head of a team of intelligence officers who have been relegated to MI5's agent graveyard ""Slough House"" after committing public slip-ups such as leaving classified documents on a train or sleeping with an ambassador's wife.

Among them is River Cartwright (Jack Lowden), the grandson of a revered and now retired agent (Jonathan Pryce), who recently bungled a high-profile training exercise. Eager to redeem himself and return to the Regent's Park headquarters, Cartwright sees his chance when a young Muslim student is kidnapped and a washed-up journalist leads him on the abductors’ tracks.

But first he must get the mission past his unkempt, flatulent boss, who seems more interested in getting drunk and insulting his staff than doing any work.

""I don't know if I like Jackson Lamb but I certainly really love playing him,” Oldman told Reuters as he attended the series' premiere in London.

“He is slovenly. He's a chain smoker, alcoholic, I would imagine he probably smells a bit like an ashtray. Sticky, sweaty, greasy hair. Yeah, playing Jackson Lamb's like easing yourself into dirty bath water.”

""I laugh. I just laugh, and we hope that we get a take where I don't laugh,"" said Lowden of acting opposite the 64-year-old.

Based on Mick Herron’s first novel in the series of ""Slough House"" books, the six-part show follows the failed spies carrying out monotonous daily tasks and dodging offers for after-work drinks.

""It's a character piece set in an office ... it's not the sort of fantastical world of James Bond,” said Oldman.

""At its essence it's a sort of office workplace drama that happens to be in the world of espionage. It's probably as close as you get to what it's actually like to work for the services,"" added Lowden.

The show, which features The Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger's first TV theme song, also stars Kristen Scott Thomas, Olivia Cooke and Rosalind Eleazar among its ensemble cast. A second season has already been filmed.

“Slow Horses” starts streaming on Apple TV+ on April 1.

April 1 (Reuters) - Slowing demand for smartphones is likely to hit growth at Apple (AAPL.O) and chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM.O), analysts at J.P. Morgan said on Friday as they dropped the companies from the list of most preferred stocks.

The removal from the brokerage's ""Analyst Focus List"" comes as analysts warn that fresh coronavirus lockdowns in China and rising cost of goods due to the Ukraine conflict could hurt smartphone demand in 2022.

Analyst Samik Chatterjee said a moderation in consumer spending would temper higher expectation from the recent iPhone SE launch, while a slowdown in gaming in China could weigh on Apple's services.

Apple is already planning to lower iPhone and AirPod production due to a demand slowdown, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Monday. read more

Qualcomm, meanwhile, will likely bear the brunt of weakness in the smartphone market for low- to mid-end Android handsets, Chatterjee said.

""There has been understandably a lot of noise around demand weakness across global tech, but we believe the macro weakness seeping through the sector will impact the consumer end-markets more materially,"" he said.

The brokerage still rates Apple and Qualcomm ""overweight"" — the equivalent of a ""buy"" rating — based on their longer-term potential.

J.P. Morgan said in an environment of slowing consumer demand it has added to its list network equipment companies Arista Networks (ANET.N) and Ciena (CIEN.N) on hopes of a more resilient demand for telecom and cloud-related spending.

52,847,APPLE,2022-04-01,Meme stock GameStop jumps on stock split plans,"













April 1 (Reuters) - Shares of GameStop Corp (GME.N) jumped 15% in premarket trading on Friday after the video game retailer at the heart of last year's retail trading frenzy said it would seek shareholder approval for a stock split.

The plan comes as shares of GameStop and other so-called ""meme"" stocks including AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC.N) are seeing renewed interest from retail investors, who are piling into riskier assets emboldened by hopes of a resolution in Russia's conflict with Ukraine.

Shares of GameStop, which have nearly doubled in value in the past two weeks, rose another 15% to $192 on bets that a stock split, which makes shares of a company more affordable, would boost the value of the retailer by attracting more retail traders.

Stock splits are becoming more common as companies look to manage ""their stock price in what is considered an investor-friendly range"", said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.

In the past two years, Apple (AAPL.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Tesla (TSLA.O) have split their shares, while Amazon (AMZN.O) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) recently announced upcoming share splits.

""Are splits the new buyback? Probably not, but highlights an additional tool to push stock prices higher despite financial theory saying otherwise,"" J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note.

Silverblatt signaled there could be more stock splits in the offing, noting that there were still eight stocks in the S&P 500 priced over $1,000 and 15 between $500 and $1,000.

Shares of most of the companies that have either announced or split their stock so far were trading over $500 before the split.

Shares of AMC and Bed Bath and Beyond Inc (BBBY.O), another retail darling, gained nearly 3% and 5%, respectively, in trading before the opening bell on Friday.

53,804,APPLE,2022-04-01,Kering to pay 187 mln euros to settle Bottega Veneta tax dispute,"













MILAN, April 1 (Reuters) - French luxury goods group Kering (PRTP.PA) agreed to pay almost 187 million euros ($207 million) to settle a dispute with Italian tax authorities centred on its fashion brand Bottega Veneta, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday.

Kering confirmed the outlines of the settlement, without giving the cost, saying it would have no impact on the group's results in 2022 or on its recurring tax rate in future years.

""In the spring of 2019, given the rapid changes in its business environment, its strong international growth and some uncertainties of Italian legislation, Bottega Veneta proactively made contact with the Italian Revenue Agency to discuss its tax position"", Kering said in a statement adding this agreement was ""the result of those discussions"".

Earlier on Friday the Milan prosecutor referred in a press release to a tax investigation led by Milan tax police into a Swiss company, part of an international luxury goods group, which allegedly operated in Italy to produce and distribute an Italian brand, without specifically naming the company.

Revenue at the Italian leather goods house were booked through Kering's Swiss-based subsidiary Luxury Goods International and Italian prosecutors and tax authorities argued that the tax should therefore have been paid in Italy, not Switzerland, the sources said.

Luxury Goods International paid 186.8 million euros to settle the tax case, covering the fiscal years 2012 to 2019.

Separately, Milan prosecutors' criminal investigation for tax evasion is still ongoing, the sources said.

Three years ago, Kering reached an agreement with the Italian tax authorities, paying a record 1.25 billion euros to settle a similar dispute centred on its fashion brand Gucci.

Milan prosecutors in the past have probed U.S. tech giants such as Apple, Amazon and Facebook over taxes, allowing Italy to net several billion euros in fines and tax payments.

In previous cases, once the agreement between the companies and the Italian tax agency was signed, prosecutors closed the criminal investigation with either a dismissal or a settlement.

March 31 (Reuters) - Online gaming platform Roblox Corp (RBLX.N) said on Thursday Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) App Store offers privacy and safety benefits to its users, supporting the iPhone-maker's bid to beat an appeal by Epic Games in a key U.S. antitrust case.

Epic, known for its ""Fortnite"" game, largely lost a trial last year over whether Apple's fees and payment rules for app makers were anti-competitive. It appealed in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. read more

""Apple's process for review and approval of apps available on the App Store enhances safety and security, and provides those apps greater legitimacy in the eyes of users,"" Roblox said in a legal filing on Thursday.

Roblox had played a prominent role in the original trial last year. The Department of Justice (DOJ) is probing key revelations from the antitrust trial between Apple and Epic Games, in which the ""Fortnite"" maker had argued that Apple had given a free pass to Roblox, whose app lets people pick from a selection of games to play.

An Apple senior director described Roblox's offering as ""experiences"". Soon after, Roblox changed descriptions on its website to ""experiences"" from ""games"" and called itself a metaverse company.

Apple has said its rules promote several benefits for consumers, including increased security and privacy. Two former Central Intelligence Agency directors and 21 other former U.S. national security officials advanced that argument in Apple's support on Thursday.

The appeal hearing is expected next year.

55,670,APPLE,2022-04-05,Russia turns to China for microchips for in-demand domestic bank cards,"[1/2] The logo of MIR payment system is on display at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) in Saint Petersburg, Russia, June 2, 2021. REUTERS/Evgenia Novozhenina/File Photo















April 5 (Reuters) - Russia is turning to microchip manufactures in China to circumvent western sanctions which have boosted demand for bank cards linked to the Mir payment system, an executive with the domestic payment system said.

Western sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine have cut Moscow off the global financial system and from nearly half of its $640 billion in gold and foreign exchange reserves.

Oleg Tishakov, a board member with the National Card Payment System (NSPK), said Russia is facing a shortage of microchips as Asian manufactures suspend production amid a coronavirus pandemic and European suppliers have stopped cooperating with Moscow following sanctions.

""We are looking for new microchip suppliers and [have] found a couple in China, with certification process ongoing,"" Tishakov told a conference on Tuesday, without giving further details.

Some of Russia's biggest banks no longer have access to the SWIFT global banking messaging system, and international payment cards Visa and MasterCard have stopped servicing Russian accounts abroad. Mir's connection to Apple Pay was removed last month.

NSPK issued over 2 million Mir cards between the end of 2021 and March, according to Reuters calculations based on the system's data, with total cards outstanding now at 116 million.

All major Russian banks have reported an increased demand for the domestic card, which some now issue in a co-brand with China's UnionPay, an alternative payment system to Visa and MasterCard for purchases by Russians abroad.

Mir cards are also accepted by some banks in Turkey, Vietnam, Armenia, Uzbekistan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Georgia breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. read more

April 5 (Reuters) - Memory chipmaker Micron Technology Inc (MU.O) on Tuesday named chip firm Qorvo Inc's (QRVO.O) finance chief Mark Murphy as its new chief financial officer.

Micron lost its former CFO David Zinsner to chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) in January.

Murphy will take the reins from interim finance chief Sumit Sadana, who will return to the role of chief business officer, the company said.

Murphy has also been named as Micron's executive vice president.

Qorvo, a supplier for Apple Inc (AAPL.O), said it has started the search for a new CFO and named vice president of treasury Grant Brown as the interim finance head.

April 5 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) said on Tuesday it will host its annual developers' conference in an online format for the third year in a row, from June 6 to June 10.

The iPhone maker is expected to provide updates on new software, including the iOS 16, at the conference.

Prior to 2020, Apple hosted the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California, with thousands of developers and Apple employees in attendance. The event was moved completely online for the first time in June 2020 due to the pandemic. It was held in an online-only format last year too. read more

This year, however, the company said it will host developers and students at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California on June 6 to watch the keynote and State of the Union videos along with the online attendees.

NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd (BB.TO) plans to settle a more than eight-year-old lawsuit claiming it defrauded shareholders by inflating the success and profitability of its long-discontinued BlackBerry 10 smartphones.

U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan federal court granted a Wednesday request by lawyers for BlackBerry and the shareholders to adjourn their planned trial so they could negotiate a preliminary settlement in the class action.

Jury selection had been scheduled to begin on Thursday. Any settlement would require the judge's approval.

Lawyers for the shareholders did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment. BlackBerry and its law firm did not immediately respond to similar requests.

While the BlackBerry 10 won positive reviews from critics, it never caught on with the public, which preferred Android-based smartphones and Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhones.

This led to BlackBerry's 2016 decision to stop making phones. The Waterloo, Ontario-based company now focuses on cybersecurity.

Shareholders accused BlackBerry of concealing BlackBerry 10's true sales prospects in public statements during 2013, resulting in an inflated share price.

The lawsuit began in October 2013. Other defendants include Chief Executive Officer Thorsten Heins, former Chief Financial Officer Brian Bidulka and former Chief Legal Officer Steve Zipperstein.

Lawsuits accusing companies of misleading shareholders are common in the United States, but few go to trial.

From 1997 to 2021, less than 1% of federal securities class actions went to trial, while most were settled or dismissed, according to Cornerstone Research.

The case is Pearlstein v BlackBerry Ltd, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 13-07060.

59,801,APPLE,2022-04-07,Buffett's Berkshire reveals stake in HP; shares surge almost 10%,"[1/3] Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett walks through the exhibit hall as shareholders gather to hear from the billionaire investor at Berkshire Hathaway Inc's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S., May 4, 2019. REUTERS/Scott Morgan/File Photo















April 6 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) disclosed on Wednesday that it has purchased nearly 121 million shares of HP Inc (HPQ.N), the latest in a series of large investments by the conglomerate controlled by billionaire Warren Buffett.

The investment gives Berkshire a roughly 11.4% stake in HP, worth about $4.2 billion based on the personal computing and printing company's closing stock price on Wednesday of $34.91.

Shares of HP rose 9.9% to $38.38 in after-hours trading after Berkshire disclosed the stake in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

HP, based in Palo Alto, California, had about 1.06 billion shares outstanding as of Jan. 31.

Neither HP nor Berkshire immediately responded to requests for comment.

The HP stake is Berkshire's third big investment since Feb. 26, when Buffett said in his annual shareholders letter that ""internal opportunities deliver far better returns than acquisitions"" and little ""excites us"" in equity markets.

On March 21, Berkshire agreed to buy insurance company Alleghany Corp (Y.N) for $11.6 billion in cash, adding to its portfolio of insurers including Geico. read more

Earlier in March, Berkshire revealed a 14.6% stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N), which cost well over $6 billion to amass. read more

Before announcing the Alleghany purchase, Buffett had gone six years without a major acquisition, leaving Berkshire with $146.7 billion of cash and equivalents. Buffett has pledged to keep at least $30 billion of cash on hand.

Berkshire did not say whether Buffett or his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler are responsible for the HP stake, though Buffett normally handles larger investments.

Buffett is chiefly responsible for Berkshire's stake in Apple Inc (AAPL.O), calling the iPhone maker one of the ""Big Four"" companies accounting for much of his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's value.

The other ""Big Four"" companies are Berkshire's insurers, the BNSF railroad, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy.

60,735,APPLE,2022-04-07,Caesars gives UK buyer a free spin at the wheel,"













LONDON, April 7 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Caesars Entertainment (CZR.O) has done what casino operators rarely do: allow a losing gambler to cut his losses. UK-listed 888 (888.L), which last September agreed to buy bookie William Hill from the U.S. group for 2.2 billion pounds, has recut the deal, giving it a 250 million pound discount and regulatory indemnity. The 850 million pound group’s shares soared 18% read more .

Caesars probably didn’t have much choice. 888’s stock price had fallen by over 50% since the deal was announced due to tougher market conditions and fears about a UK government review of the sector. That could have complicated 888’s attempts to get shareholders, who need to pony up 500 million pounds to fund the deal, to approve it. Worse, William Hill’s licence is under review, and it may need to address regulators’ concerns over its “social responsibilities”. The discount is probably a small price to pay for $15 billion Caesars to safely offload the assets, which it acquired in 2020 primarily to get its hands on William Hill’s U.S. operations. 888 no longer needs to raise the full 500 million pounds. But its shrivelled market worth means another player may fancy a flutter. (By Neil Unmack)

NEW YORK, April 7 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) said on Wednesday it had taken an 11% stake in computer and printer maker HP (HPQ.N), worth $4.2 billion. Unfortunately for Warren Buffett, he looks more likely to repeat his experience with IBM (IBM.N) than with Apple (AAPL.O).

HP’s valuation of 9 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months appears cheap, and the company should return some $5 billion to investors this fiscal year. Buffett’s blessing has goosed read more the firm’s value to $43 billion.

IBM and Apple shares were both trading at a price-to-earnings discount to the S&P 500 when Berkshire bought shares in the companies in 2011 and 2016 respectively. Berkshire has earned over $100 billion on Apple. In contrast, IBM was a squandered opportunity. The exit was largely a wash, but the S&P 500 Index more than doubled during Buffett’s IBM ownership.

The difference was revenue. After Berkshire bought shares, Apple sales grew 70% as the company introduced new products. By contrast, revenue shrank at fading IBM. Analysts think HP sales should remain stable over the next few years, according to Refinitiv. But PC and printer sales are mature. If they start shrinking, this could be another opportunity squandered. (By Robert Cyran)

63,637,APPLE,2022-04-08,Toshiba’s bids plan deserves cautious optimism,"













HONG KONG, April 8 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Chalk up one for Toshiba’s (6502.T) activist shareholders: the embattled $17 billion group has launched a fresh strategic review to engage with buyout groups and other potential investors. Coming just five months after a similar exercise concluded a buyout wasn’t the best option, the shift speaks to the drama that has ensued since, including a surprise chief executive change, two defeated shareholder votes, a revolt by one board member and last week’s sly unveiling of support from Toshiba’s top shareholder, activist Effissimo, for a bid by Bain Capital.

It doesn’t mean buyout advocates have won. Toshiba has politically and militarily sensitive units, complicating any deal. Prices may fall short of activists’ assumed starting point of roughly 6,000 yen a share - a one-fifth jump from current levels. Toshiba plans an update before its June annual meeting. Given its last AGM voted out its chairman and the one before triggered allegations of vote-rigging, it's fair to assume the drama isn’t over yet. (By Jennifer Hughes)

MILAN, April 8 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Credit Agricole (CAGR.PA) boss Philippe Brassac is taking the fast lane on Italy’s M&A highway. The French bank scooped up 9% of No. 3 Italian lender Banco BPM (BAMI.MI) read more , long seen as a takeover target. The stake acts as a potential roadblock to Italian takeover rivals like UniCredit (CRDI.MI) and BPER (EMII.MI), and protects Credit Agricole’s lucrative 61% holding in consumer-finance player Agos Ducato, which it co-owns with BPM. It could also presage a purchase of the $5 billion bank, based in the wealthy Lombardy region. Brassac, who boosted his Italian exposure last year by acquiring Credito Valtellinese, would be able to boost returns through cost savings.

Heavyweight Italian lender UniCredit, run by M&A enthusiast Andrea Orcel, was readying a Banco BPM bid earlier this year. But UniCredit’s problematic 7 billion euro exposure to Russia may have acted as a brake. That gave Brassac his passing opportunity. If a bid emerges, he can play kingmaker or have a tilt at the full prize himself. (By Lisa Jucca)

65,706,APPLE,2022-04-11,"Epic Games valued at about $32 bln in funding from Sony, Lego firm","













April 11 (Reuters) - Epic Games said on Monday it had raised $2 billion from Sony Group Corp (6758.T) and the family owned holding company behind the Lego Group, valuing the ""Fortnite"" creator at $31.5 billion.

Sony, an existing investor, and the Kirkbi investment company each invested $1 billion, Epic said, with the fundraising to help advance a metaverse partnership the company had entered into with the Lego Group earlier this month.

Metaverse is the latest buzzword in the technology space, and broadly refers to the idea of a shared virtual platform that people can access through different devices and where they can move through digital environments.

Deals are picking up pace in the segment as tech giants see it to be a major innovation and revenue generator.

Microsoft (MSFT.O) in January agreed to buy ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) for $68.7 billion, marking the biggest acquisition in the gaming sector and boosting the industry's bet on the metaverse. read more

""Fortnite"" is already considered to be part of the metaverse, and the investment in Epic will give Sony a chance to delve deeper and capitalize on that business.

Epic Games has largely lost a trial last year over whether Apple's (AAPL.O) payment rules for apps were anticompetitive. That decision found Apple had suitable reasons to force some app makers such as Epic to use its payment system and take commissions of 15% to 30% on their sales.

Top brass rode to the Jakarta ceremony on own-brand electric mopeds while the $1.1 billion deal, the first under new rules designed to lure startups, boasted a record number of participants. Shares in the $28 billion e-commerce, ride-hailing and financial technology firm then jumped more than 20% in opening trade. read more

GoTo’s float follows a year in which other hot Asian tech IPOs have soared on open only to falter soon after, including Korea’s Coupang , Singapore-based Grab and local rival Bukalapak (BUKA.JK). None of three now trade within 50% of their listing prices. At 28 times trailing sales, unprofitable GoTo is roughly in line with Grab, its regional rival.

The company’s push towards using electric scooters is political catnip in polluted Jakarta; giving its drivers a piece of the float widens its investor base and generates local goodwill. It doesn’t hurt that the commodities-heavy Jakarta bourse is up 11% this year. Perhaps GoTo’s political nous will help keep its share price from dropping into lower gear. (By Jennifer Hughes)

67,432,APPLE,2022-04-11,Exclusive: Senior EU officials were targeted with Israeli spyware,"













BRUSSELS/WASHINGTON - April 11 (Reuters) - Senior officials at the European Commission were targeted last year with spy software designed by an Israeli surveillance firm, according to two EU officials and documentation reviewed by Reuters.

Among them was Didier Reynders, a senior Belgian statesman who has served as the European Justice Commissioner since 2019, according to one of the documents. At least four other commission staffers were also targeted, according to the document and another person familiar with the matter. The two EU officials confirmed that staffers at the commission had been targeted but did not provide details.

The commission became aware of the targeting following messages issued by Apple to thousands of iPhone owners in November telling them they were ""targeted by state-sponsored attackers,"" the two EU officials said. It was the first time Apple had sent a mass alert to users that they were in government hackers' crosshairs.

The warnings triggered immediate concern at the commission, the two officials said. In a Nov. 26 email reviewed by Reuters, a senior tech staffer sent a message to colleagues with background about Israeli hacking tools and a request to be on the lookout for additional warnings from Apple.

""Given the nature of your responsibilities, you are a potential target,"" the staffer said in the email, reviewed by Reuters.

Reuters was unable to determine who used the Israeli spyware to target Reynders and his Brussels-based colleagues, whether the attempts were successful, and, if so, what the hackers might have obtained as a result.

Reynders and his spokesman David Marechal did not return repeated messages. European Commission spokesman Johannes Bahrke declined comment. Apple declined comment.

Security researchers have said the recipients of the warnings were targeted between February and September 2021 using ForcedEntry, an advanced piece of software that was used by Israeli cyber surveillance vendor NSO Group to help foreign spy agencies remotely and invisibly take control of iPhones. A smaller Israeli spyware vendor named QuaDream also sold a nearly identical tool to government clients, Reuters previously reported.

NSO said in a statement that it was not responsible for the hacking attempts, saying the targeting described by Reuters ""could not have happened with NSO's tools.""

The company, which faces a number of overlapping lawsuits and was recently blacklisted by U.S. officials over alleged human rights abuses, said it supported an investigation into the targeting and called for the establishment of global rules to govern the spyware industry.

QuaDream, which keeps a lower profile, did not return repeated messages.

IT experts examined at least some of the officials' smartphones for signs of compromise but the results were inconclusive, according to the two EU sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak to the press.

Reuters has not been able to determine whether the commission is still investigating the matter.

News of the targeting comes as the European Union is beginning to follow the United States in taking a harder look at spyware merchants like NSO.

The European Parliament is set to launch a committee of inquiry to investigate the use of surveillance software in European member states on April 19, according to Sophie in 't Veld, the EU lawmaker who championed the committee's creation.

In 't Veld told Reuters she had been unaware that European Commission officials were targeted, calling the news ""dynamite.""

""We really have to get to the bottom of this,"" she said.

The committee was formed in the wake of reports that senior opposition politicians in Poland had their phones hacked with Israeli spyware and that prominent critics and investigative journalists in Hungary had also been targeted.

Polish officials and a Hungarian ruling party lawmaker have acknowledged that their respective governments purchased NSO software, although both nations have denied wrongdoing in relation to allegations of domestic espionage.

It was important not to jump to conclusions about who might be responsible, said Kenneth Lasoen, a research fellow at the Clingendael Netherlands Institute of International Relations.

The EU “are a very high profile target for multiple actors,” Lasoen said. “Brussels is a true nest of espionage.”

BRUSSELS, April 11 (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) faces an additional EU antitrust charge in the coming weeks in an investigation triggered by a complaint from Spotify (SPOT.N), a person familiar with the matter said, a sign that EU enforcers are strengthening their case against the U.S. company.

The European Commission last year accused the iPhone maker of distorting competition in the music streaming market via restrictive rules for its App Store that force developers to use its own in-app payment system and prevent them from informing users of other purchasing options. read more

Such requirements have also come under scrutiny in countries including the United States and Britain.

Extra charges set out in a so-called supplementary statement of objections are usually issued to companies when the EU competition enforcer has gathered new evidence or has modified some elements to boost its case.

The Commission declined to comment. Apple had no immediate comment.

Under new EU tech rules called the Digital Markets Act (DMA) agreed last month, such practices are illegal. However Apple and other U.S. tech giants targeted by the rules will have a couple of years before the crackdown starts.

""The DMA is still two years away. The rules will probably apply to Apple at the beginning of 2024. This is why antitrust cases remain important,"" said lawyer Damien Geradin at Geradin Partners, who is advising several app developers in other cases against Apple.

Companies found breaching EU antitrust rules face fines of as much as 10% of their global turnover and orders to ditch anti-competitive practices.

In addition to the music streaming investigation, Apple's practices in e-books and its Apple Pay are also in the EU antitrust crosshairs.

Sweden's Spotify, the largest music subscription service in the world, is one of Europe's big global success stories in consumer technology.

NEW DELHI, April 11 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has started making the iPhone 13 in India, the company said on Monday, as the U.S tech giant tries to reduce reliance on its Chinese supply chain.

The phone is being produced at a local plant of Apple's Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn (2354.TW), situated in the town of Sriperumbudur in Southern Tamil Nadu state, according to a source.

Apple has been shifting some areas of iPhone production from China to other markets including India, the world's second biggest smartphone market, and is also planning to assemble iPad tablets there.

India and countries such as Mexico and Vietnam are becoming increasingly important to contract manufacturers supplying American brands as they try to diversify production away from China.

The iPhone 13 is the fourth model to be produced locally after Apple launched manufacturing operations in India in 2017 with the iPhone SE.

BENGALURU, April 11 (Reuters) - Indian software giant Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS.NS) reported a 7.4% rise in March-quarter profit on Monday, as more businesses across the world leaned on technology and related services to drive their operations.

The company, India's top IT exporter, typically kicks off the earnings season for the country's thriving IT sector and is often seen as its bellwether, given the company's rich roster of clients including Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

Mumbai-based TCS reported a net profit of 99.26 billion rupees ($1.31 billion) for the three months to March 31, up from 92.46 billion rupees a year earlier.

Analysts on average had expected a profit of 100.01 billion rupees, according to Refinitiv data.

TCS posted its highest-ever order book total contract value of $11.3 billion in the quarter, the company said.

TCS and rivals Infosys (INFY.NS), Wipro (WIPR.NS) and HCL Technologies (HCLT.NS) have been winning more large contracts from businesses that are investing in services ranging from cloud computing, digital payment infrastructure, crypto platforms to cyber-security.

""Increasing participation in our customers' growth and transformation journeys, and an all-time high order book provide a strong and sustainable foundation for continued growth ahead,"" TCS' Chief Executive Officer Rajesh Gopinathan said in a statement.

Revenue from operations jumped 15.8% to 505.91 billion rupees, while banking and finance segment revenue rose 11.2% to 195.32 billion rupees. The unit is the company's top revenue contributor.

TCS also recommended a final dividend of 22 rupees per share.

71,475,APPLE,2022-04-11,Hong Kong police arrest veteran journalist for alleged sedition,"













HONG KONG, April 11 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's national security police arrested a veteran journalist and former contributing writer with the now-shuttered liberal media outlet Stand News, on Monday for alleged sedition, police and local media said.

A crackdown on the media based on a sedition law that dates from the British colonial-era, as all as a China-imposed national security law has seen several major media outlets raided by police and closed down, including the Apple Daily newspaper and the Stand News online news portal.

Local police said in a statement that the national security department of the police force had arrested a 54 year-old male for ""conspiracy to publish seditious publications"" and had detained him for further investigation.

Local media indentified the man as Allan Au, a veteran journalist and academic at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who wrote columns for newspapers including Ming Pao and the now closed Apple Daily.

Reuters was not able to immediately reach Au for comment.

Sedition is not among the offences listed under a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing in June 2020 that punishes terrorism, collusion with foreign forces, subversion and secession with possible life imprisonment.

But court judgments in recent months have enabled authorities to use powers conferred by the new legislation to deploy rarely used colonial era laws covering sedition.

When questioned about Au's arrest, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam told a news conference she would not comment on individual cases, but said press freedom was enshrined in the city's mini-constitution, the Basic Law.

The Hong Kong Journalists' Association expressed ""deep concern"" and said the arrest risked ""further damaging Hong Kong's press freedom"".

Au, who was known for his critical columns, is a former Knight Fellow at Stanford University.

""I once wondered whether I could keep writing till 2047, but it's a delusion in the end,"" Au wrote in one of his last published columns, referring to China's constitutional promise under the Basic Law to keep Hong Kong's freedoms and autonomy intact for 50 years until 2047.

""We still haven’t reached 2047, but 2047 has arrived before our very eyes,"" Au wrote.

Au's arrest adds to the number of journalists targeted after the enactment of the security law. Two former senior editors of Stand News had also been charged in December with conspiring to publish and or reproduce seditious publications read more .

72,398,APPLE,2022-04-12,Taiwan iPhone maker Pegatron suspends operations at two China plants,"













TAIPEI, April 12 (Reuters) - Taiwan's Pegatron Corp (4938.TW), which assembles iPhones for Apple Inc (AAPL.O), said on Tuesday it had suspended operations at its Shanghai and Kunshan plants in China due to the government's strict COVID-19 protocols.

China has put Shanghai under a tight lockdown since late March and neighbouring Kunshan has also tightened curbs to control the country's biggest COVID-19 outbreak since the coronavirus was discovered in late 2019 in the city of Wuhan. read more

Global companies, from phone to chip makers, are highly dependent on China and Southeast Asia for production and have been diversifying their supply chains after the pandemic caused havoc.

According to Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission, as of April 7 a total of 161 listed Taiwanese companies reported their operations in Shanghai and Kunshan have stopped, 41 of them make electronics.

""In the best-case scenario, complete resumption of production may not be possible until late April or early May,"" analyst Ming-Chi Kuo with TF International Securities said, adding that Apple could minimise the impact due to its strong supply chain and relationship with the Chinese government.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Staffing, logistics and transportation issues are forcing manufacturers to rely on available inventory, barely meeting the needs of production lines and exacerbating component mismatches, according to data provider TrendForce.

A surge in shipments and demand for materials after lockdowns are lifted could also gridlock customs authorities, causing potential delivery delays, according to the TrendForce report.

Demand for iPhones could also be hit as consumers divert funds from phones and gadgets to everyday essentials.

Pegatron said the resumption of work depended on the two plants being given clearance by the government.

The company said it will maintain close contact with customers and suppliers and ""actively cooperate"" with local governments to resume work as soon as possible.

The far larger Taiwanese firm Foxconn (2317.TW), the world's largest contract electronics maker, also assembles iPhones in China. Its operations in the southern city of Shenzhen were disrupted last month by a COVID-19 outbreak there. read more

73,815,APPLE,2022-04-12,Utility’s share pop turns on Dubai’s IPO pipeline,"













LONDON, April 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Interest rates might be rising but some utilities still look red hot. An initial public offering of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWAA.DU) (DEWA) jumped 20% on its first trading day on Tuesday, valuing the company at 149 billion dirhams ($40.6 billion). The deal, triple the original size and priced at the top end of its indicative price range, raised $6.1 billion for its owner, the Dubai government. There’s further room to run, too.

Even after the strong start, DEWA’s enterprise value looks cheap relative to regional and European rivals. At 12.7 times the EBITDA it is expected to generate in 2022, European and Gulf-based water and energy providers including Snam (SRG.MI), Elia (ELI.BR), National Grid (NG.L), United Utilities (UU.L), Tabreed (TABR.DU) and Qatar Fuel (QFLS.QA) trade on an average 14 times. What’s more, its 5% dividend yield is higher than the 3.6% average of those peers, and a heavy presence of foreigners amongst DEWA’s customers means it’s easier for it to raise prices as needed. The biggest public share sale for the region since Saudi Aramco’s (2222.SE) in 2019 is a win for the government looking to prime the Dubai Financial Market for more share sales, including its flag carrier Emirates.

74,419,APPLE,2022-04-12,Private markets keep faith with the metaverse,"













LONDON, April 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Epic Games is defying the technology slump. The video game developer on Monday announced a $2 billion fundraising that valued it at $32 billion, with Sony (6758.T) and Lego parent Kirkbi putting in $1 billion each. The new valuation is 10% above the $29 billion secured 12 months ago. During that time gaming rivals Roblox (RBLX.N), Electronic Arts (EA.O) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO.O) have fallen 26%, on average. Facebook parent Meta Platforms (FB.O) is down a whopping 32% since boss Mark Zuckerberg launched his pricey pivot to virtual reality.

The booming valuation is hard to square with what little has been disclosed about Epic’s recent performance. Sales, mainly from its flagship “Fortnite” game, shrunk 10% to $5.1 billion between 2018 and 2020, according to a presentation disclosed during the company’s 2021 legal fight with Apple and a Verge article citing in-court testimony. But the group’s powerful “Unreal Engine” software could still be key to creating many of the immersive virtual worlds of the future. Lego teamed up with Epic last week to build “a place for kids to play in the metaverse”; Poland’s CD Projekt (CDR.WA) will switch to “Unreal” for its next blockbuster game. Those benefits may yet take years to come through, but sometimes the long game is easier to play outside the public eye. (By Oliver Taslic)

TAIPEI, April 13 (Reuters) - More than 30 Taiwan companies, many making electronics parts, said on Wednesday that government COVID-19 control measures in eastern China had led them to suspend production until at least next week, as disruption from the measures spreads.

China has put Shanghai under a tight lockdown since late March and neighbouring Kunshan has also tightened curbs to control the country's biggest COVID-19 outbreak since the coronavirus was discovered in late 2019 in the city of Wuhan. read more

Global companies, from mobile phone to chip makers, are highly dependent on China and Southeast Asia for production and have been diversifying their supply chains after the pandemic caused havoc.

Among the Taiwan firms notifying the stock exchange was Quanta Computer Inc (2382.TW), an assembler of Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) MacBook, which said a Shanghai unit had suspended operations, with resumption depending on government approval.

It said it was in close touch with suppliers and assessing the financial impact.

Asia Electronic Material Co Ltd (4939.TWO), which makes parts for laptops, mobile phones and digital cameras, said its plant in Kunshan would be closed until next Tuesday, adding it was ""hard to estimate"" the financial impact.

EFUN Technology Co Ltd (3523.TWO), which makes parts for liquid crystal displays, said its plant in nearby Suzhou would also be closed until Tuesday, resuming operations on the government's go-ahead, but did not foresee a financial impact for the time being.

Chip substrate and printed circuit board maker Unimicron Technology Corp (3037.TW), which also supplies Apple and Intel (INTC.O), said on Tuesday its Kunshan operations closure would also extend to next Tuesday.

It said it was ""integrating"" its resources and manufacturing to cut the impact on customers, adding that its two Kunshan units accounted for about 13% of consolidated revenue in the year's first quarter.

However, some companies said they had applied to continue operations under a ""closed loop"" system, with workers isolated inside, including the Kunshan automotive electronics operations of Wieson Technologies Co Ltd (6272.TWO).

Taiwan's Pegatron Corp (4938.TW), which assembles iPhones for Apple, said on Tuesday it had suspended operations at its Shanghai and Kunshan plants because of the tough measures. read more

BOSTON, April 13 (Reuters) - The activist investor that pushed to oust Peloton Interactive Inc's (PTON.O) co-founder and leader in January is now criticizing its new chief executive officer, arguing he has not made enough changes and that the company should be sold now.

Blackwells Capital, which owns nearly 5% of the company, said Peloton has failed to deliver on promises to transform the business and that too many insiders, including co-founder John Foley, continue to control its moves.

Peloton, a market darling during the COVID-19 pandemic as people flocked to its bikes, treadmills and popular streamed workouts, hired former Netflix (NFLX.O) executive Barry McCarthy as CEO in February to replace Foley who was named executive chairman. read more

In a presentation published on Wednesday, Blackwells said the new management team has failed to make ""meaningful changes"" and that shareholders have lost nearly $2 billion of value since McCarthy was hired.

Peloton's stock price, which had come under pressure as people returned to gyms as the pandemic eased, has fallen nearly 40% since McCarthy arrived. The company is now worth $7.8 billion, down from nearly $50 billion at its peak during the pandemic. The stock price climbed 5% to $24.91 after the presentation was published.

Peloton said it appreciates investors views and has ""acted, and will continue to act, in the best interest of all Peloton shareholders.”

Blackwells' founder, Jason Aintabi, said the $800 million expense reduction plan does not appear to go far enough and that there was room to ""further rationalize the business.""

Aintabi also criticized Foley's decision in February to sell roughly $50 million in Peloton stock to Michael Dell's MSD Partners at a 12% discount. The move exacerbates ""misalignment with other shareholders,"" the presentation said.

Aintabi again said Peloton should be sold. It could bring at least $75 a share in a sale and companies like Apple , Amazon (AMZN.O), Google (GOOGL.O), Netflix and Nike (NKE.N) have complementary businesses that would mesh with Peloton, Aintabi said.

""For Peloton to garner a similar share price would likely take years through the acquisition of millions more subscribers,"" the presentation said.

Had asked for over $80 million in damages for alleged infringement















(Reuters) - A Delaware jury on Wednesday rejected claims that technology made by Aptiv PLC for connecting Apple iPhones to automobile entertainment systems violates patents owned by Microchip Technology Inc.

Aptiv's Dual Role Hub did not infringe any part of a Microchip patent related to its integrated circuits used in competing entertainment systems, the jury said.

Dublin, Ireland-based Aptiv supplies parts for Tesla, General Motors, Ford, Chrysler and Volkswagen cars. Chandler, Arizona-based Microchip said it had lost tens of millions from Aptiv's sales of the Dual Role Hub.

Microchip had planned to ask for up to $87.2 million for Aptiv's alleged infringement of two of its patents, according to a court order from last week, though only one of the patents remained for the jury to consider at trial.

Aptiv's attorney Daralyn Durie of Durie Tangri said she and the company were ""delighted"" by the verdict. Microchip and its attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The jury did not side with Aptiv on its argument that Microchip's patent was invalid.

Microchip first sued Aptiv over the technology in 2017.

U.S. District Judge Joshua Wolson of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania presided over the case.

The case is Microchip Technology Inc v. Aptiv Services US LLC, U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, No. 1:17-cv-01194.

April 13 (Reuters) - Facebook parent Meta Platforms (FB.O) will charge creators around 47.5% on sales of digital assets and experiences made inside the company's virtual reality platform Horizon Worlds.

The overall charge comprises of 30% hardware platform fee for sales made through Meta Quest Store, where it sells apps and games meant for its virtual reality headsets, and a further 17.5% cut as its Horizon platform fees, a Meta spokesperson told Reuters on Wednesday.

On Monday, the tech giant said it would start testing tools for creators to sell digital assets and in turn make money on Horizon Worlds, a key part of its plan for creating a metaverse. read more

Meta chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has been a critic of Apple Inc's app store fees of 30%, but Meta's latest move to charge creators nearly half their sales on its own platform has angered many of them.

The Facebook parent company, which changed its name to Meta last year, has invested heavily in virtual and augmented reality to reflect its new bet on the metaverse, a futuristic idea of a network of virtual environments accessed via different devices where users can work, socialize and play.

Meta's Horizon Worlds, an expansive VR social platform, and Horizon Venues, which is focused on virtual events, are early iterations of metaverse-like spaces.

Summary Companies Sees Q2 revenue $17.6 bln-$18.2 bln, vs $13.3 bln year prior

Q1 profit T$202.7 bln vs T$184.67 bln analyst view

Q1 revenue up 36% on year to $17.57 bln















TAIPEI, April 14 (Reuters) - Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW) forecast an up to 37% jump in current-quarter sales and said it expects chip capacity to remain very tight this year, amid a global crunch that has kept order books full and allowed chipmakers to charge premium prices.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) , the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major Apple Inc supplier, forecast revenue of $17.6 billion to $18.2 billion in the quarter ending June 30, up from $13.29 billion a year earlier.

TSMC is working to address supply chain challenges with tool suppliers to help them expand capacity, CEO C.C. Wei told an online earnings briefing, referring to a cycle of shortages where makers of chip equipment are struggling to find the chips needed for equipment to supply chipmakers like TSMC.

""Our suppliers are facing great challenges in their supply chain from the continued impact of COVID-19, which are creating labour, component and chip constraints in their supply chains, and extending tool delivery time for both advanced and mature nodes,"" he said.

TSMC defines advanced node as 7 nanometre and more advanced technologies, chips that account for half its revenue.

Wei said that TSMC had been facing the tool delivery problem since the beginning of this year and the company was working hard with its tool suppliers to resolve issues, including sending teams on site to support suppliers.

He added that the company did not expect any impact to its capacity plan this year.

The company, which has already lifted capital spending for this year to keep up with the surge in demand, said a 36% jump in first-quarter revenue was supported by better-than-expected demand from smartphone customers and high performance computing (HPC) chips, as well as strong demand for auto related chips. read more

TSMC expects chip demand to continue in the long term, Wei said, calling it a ""mega-trend"" in the industry supported by demand for HPC chips for 5G and artificial intelligence, as well as an increase in chips used in gadgets.

The shortage has forced automakers and electronics manufacturers to cut production.

Revenue from its HPC business, which serves customers such as Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), rose 26% in January-March from October-December, and accounted for 41% of the company's total revenue.

Wei said he expected HPC to be the strongest growing business in this year and in the following years.

Revenue from TSMC's smartphone business, which sells to Apple, ticked up 1% from the previous quarter in a typically soft season for the product.

Apple is planning to lower iPhone and AirPod production due to a demand slowdown caused by the Ukraine crisis and rising inflation, according to media reports. read more

Net profit for the January-March quarter jumped 45% from a year earlier to T$202.7 billion ($7 billion). Analysts expected a profit of T$184.67 billion, according to an average of 19 estimates compiled by Refinitiv.

Shares of TSMC have fallen about 6.8% so far this year, giving the firm a market value of $511.1 billion. The stock closed flat on Thursday, compared with a 0.3% fall for the benchmark index (.TWII).

BOSTON, April 18 (Reuters) - Median pay for top U.S. CEOs rose 31% last year to a record $20 million, a new study found, surging after a slight decline during the COVID-19 pandemic, as companies showered leaders with stock awards and cash bonuses.

Chief executives receiving big pay increases included the leaders of tech giant Apple (AAPL.O) and semiconductor manufacturer Broadcom Inc, (AVGO.O), according to the study released Monday by research firm Equilar.

It covered the 100 largest U.S. companies by revenue that filed proxy statements by March 31. The same study a year ago found median CEO pay was $15.5 million, 2% lower than in 2020.

Equilar director of content Amit Batish said companies looked to reward leaders who steered them through challenges like supply shortages. Rising revenue and share prices also boosted compensation. ""A lot of these companies did well during the pandemic, that was definitely driving the increases in pay,"" he said.

The higher pay could prompt critical shareholder votes, Batish added, though other investors care more about returns. Among S&P 500 companies, average support for advisory votes on executive pay fell to 88.3% last year from 89.6% in 2020, according to pay consultancy Semler Brossy, and was at 85.6% this year so far.

The trends also to pushed up the ratio of CEO pay to the pay of companies' median workers to 254:1 from 238:1 a year ago, Equilar's study said.

It cited executives like Apple CEO Tim Cook, who received $98.7 million last year, up from $14.8 million in 2020, including a major stock award. Investors cast 64% of votes in favor of the pay at the company's March 4 annual meeting, a low level of support. read more

Communications with Apple justified case in Apple's home district, court says















(Reuters) - An Apple Inc lawsuit to head off potential patent claims over Wi-Fi messaging can move forward in California, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said Monday in a ruling that revived the case.

The appeals court said a California court wrongly decided it lacked jurisdiction over Apple's adversary, Greenville, S.C.-based Zipit Wireless.

Zipit's communications with Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters were enough to justify bringing the case in Northern California federal court, the Federal Circuit said.

Zipit first told Apple about the patents in 2013, which relate to sending and receiving instant messages using Wi-Fi. The companies exchanged several letters and met at Apple's headquarters to discuss a potential patent license or sale, according to Monday's ruling.

Talks broke down in 2016, and Zipit accused Apple of infringement. Zipit sued Apple in 2020 in Georgia federal court but voluntarily dropped the case two weeks later.

Apple then sued Zipit in San Jose, California, shortly after, seeking a declaration that it did not infringe. U.S. District Judge Edward Davila dismissed the case last year because Zipit's only contacts with the district were its communications with the tech giant.

Davila noted that the Federal Circuit has said it would be unfair to find jurisdiction based solely on communications ""warning against infringement or negotiating license agreements.""

But the Federal Circuit reversed the decision Monday and said there was ""no general rule that demand letters can never create specific personal jurisdiction.""

The three-judge panel said other factors favored hearing the case in California and that holding the case there would not unfairly burden Zipit.

The companies and their attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The case is Apple Inc v. Zipit Wireless Inc, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, No. 21-1760.

April 18 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) is expected to report its slowest quarterly revenue growth in nearly eight years on Tuesday, but the focus will be on its forecast in the run-up to new seasons of popular titles including ""Stranger Things"" and ""Ozark"".

The company is spending billions to bring more original films and TV shows, as well as build mobile games in an effort to add subscribers in a post-pandemic world where it is grappling with competition from HBO Max (WBD.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Walt Disney (DIS.N).

Netflix could lose about a million subscribers due to its Russia exit, analysts have indicated. read more

Analysts expect Netflix to add 2.6 million subscribers in the first quarter and 2.7 million in the seasonally weak second quarter, according to Refinitiv data, still below the average number of subscribers it added during the peak of the pandemic.

Analysts say the company's subscriber growth will come from developing regions where it has cut prices, while increased prices in the United States and Canada would fund new content.

""Longer-term, most investors struggle to see the catalyst for a major re-acceleration in net additions in FY23 or beyond,"" Dan Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said.

THE CONTEXT

Netflix has bought three gaming studios to diversify sources of revenue, but analysts do not expect a big bump from that soon.

""We are not very convinced that users will really view video games as anything other than a minor feature,"" Morningstar analyst Neil Macker said, adding the effort is just a ""distraction"" from its core business.

Netflix's most formidable challenger is Disney+, which launched in late 2019 and expects to have about 230 million to 260 million subscribers over the next two years. Platforms like HBO Max, Apple TV+ and Amazon Prime have also seen a significant growth in subscribers.

And while Netflix has had several Academy Award nominations in the past, Apple became the first streaming company to win a Best Picture Oscar for ""CODA"".

BERLIN, April 19 (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) said on Tuesday that a new growth plan would aim to reduce its vulnerability to the effects of global conflicts, such as supply chain disruption and rising prices, by divesting more power to its regions and brands.

""The latest geopolitical changes and increased block-building have been exposing our global vulnerability, particularly with regards to the U.S.,"" Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess said in a LinkedIn post.

Diess did not specify which political events he was referring to, but carmakers have been hit hard by Russia's invasion of Ukraine as Western sanctions pushed up the price of energy and raw materials.

This has raised concerns over how the automaking industry would cope if escalating tensions with China also led to economic measures. read more

Volkswagen warned last week that it was feeling the impact of rising prices and supply chain bottlenecks, with deliveries in March down 37.3% from last year.

A shortage of wire harnesses produced in Ukraine delayed the launch of its electric ID.5 from April to May, and on-and-off lockdowns in China are hampering output at a time when the carmaker is attempting to drive up electric vehicle sales in the country. read more

Mercedes-Benz (MBGn.DE) Chief Technology Officer Markus Schaefer said last week that the German carmaker was also tightening its supply chains in light of global bottlenecks.

Volkswagen's Diess said the board saw boosting its China business, growing software division Cariad and reorganising its steering model as the most pressing issues facing the carmaker.

China accounts for around 40% of Volkswagen's sales but the carmaker is far behind local competitors in the electric vehicle market, just missing its target of selling 80,000 to 100,000 electric cars in the country last year. read more

Volkswagen will release more details in coming weeks on exactly how responsibilities will be divided up, Diess said.

""Our competitors are no longer called Mercedes-Benz, Toyota Motor Corporation or Stellantis, but Tesla, Foxconn, Apple, LG Electronics, Uber etc,"" Diess said.

Diess first announced a reshuffling of responsibilities at Volkswagen last December, after weeks of clashes between the CEO and labour unions over his leadership. read more

85,192,APPLE,2022-04-20,Workers at Atlanta Apple store file to hold first U.S. union election,"













April 20 (Reuters) - Workers at an Apple Inc (AAPL.O) store in Atlanta on Wednesday filed a petition to hold a union election, seeking to become the company's first U.S. store to unionize amid a wave of labor activity at other major firms.

The effort at the Apple store in Cumberland Mall is backed by the Communications Workers of America, according to a news release issued by the union and workers involved in the effort. More than 70% of the more than 100 workers eligible to join the union - in sales, technical, creative and operations roles - signed cards expressing a desire to organize, the union said.

A spokesperson for the U.S. National Labor Relations Board confirmed that the agency's Atlanta office received the union petition on Wednesday. If certain conditions are met, the NLRB works with the union and the employer to arrange an election.

""We work hard at Apple because we really believe in the products and the company and we want to make sure that every Apple worker is able to afford quality housing and basic living expenses,"" Elli Daniels, an Apple worker who is part of the union effort, said in a statement.

Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The news of the petition was first reported by Bloomberg Law.

Unionization efforts are gaining momentum at some large U.S. corporations including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O). read more

Apple is known for its reticent culture, but last year some current and former workers began criticizing the company's working conditions online, using the hashtag #AppleToo.

87,592,APPLE,2022-04-20,Taiwan firms in China hub make uneven restart from COVID curbs,"













TAIPEI, April 20 (Reuters) - Taiwan firms making chip and electronic components reported a mixed picture on Wednesday on work resumption in the eastern Chinese city of Kunshan after COVID-19 curbs, with some warning deliveries would be postponed until next month.

China has put Shanghai under a tight lockdown since late March and neighbouring Kunshan has also tightened curbs to control the country's biggest COVID-19 outbreak since the coronavirus was discovered in late 2019 in the city of Wuhan.

That had caused dozens of Taiwanese firms, many making parts for the semiconductor and electronics industries, to suspend operations. read more

Global companies, from makers of mobile phones to chips, are highly dependent on China and Southeast Asia for production and have been diversifying their supply chains after the pandemic caused havoc.

Chip substrate and printed circuit board maker Unimicron Technology Corp (3037.TW) said its Kunshan plant was gradually resuming operations from Wednesday.

Unimicron, which supplies Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O), said in a statement to the Taipei stock exchange that the factory had suspended production from April 2 to 19.

It added it was ""gradually resuming work depending on local personnel and logistics conditions"".

However, Asia Electronic Material Co Ltd (4939.TWO), which makes parts for laptops, mobile phones and digital cameras, said its plant in Kunshan would continue to be closed, having originally reported the suspension would last until Tuesday.

It added it had applied for government permission to be allowed to resume work and that it had been given permission to deliver goods and would do so from current stocks.

""It is estimated that some orders will be postponed until May,"" the company added in its stock exchange statement.

Flexible printed circuit maker Complex Micro Interconnection Co Ltd (6835.TWO) said it too saw some deliveries not happening until next month, adding it would look at the ""detailed rules"" and apply to resume production.

Bike maker Giant Manufacturing Co Ltd (9921.TW) said its Kunshan electric bike operations remained closed, adding its workers would put in overtime to catch up once it's allowed to re-open.

Speaking to reporters in Taipei, Taiwan Economy Minister Wang Mei-hua said Taiwanese companies were slowly resuming production in China, but there were still logistics problems.

""Certainly on the impact for supply chains there is a lot of uncertainty,"" she added.

Cheng Ping, CEO of Delta Electronics Inc (2308.TW), a supplier of power components to companies such as Apple and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), was quoted in Taiwan media on Wednesday as saying 20% of April production had been affected by the China lockdowns.

""At present the orders are all in hand, and customers are in a hurry, pressing us every day,"" he was quoted as saying.

Still, the production resumption news cheered Unimicron's shares, which ended the day up 4.51%, outperforming the broader index (.TWII) which closed up 0.91%.

Companies Starbucks Corp Follow















April 20 (Reuters) - Starbucks Inc (SBUX.O) on Wednesday filed complaints with a U.S. labor board accusing a union organizing cafe workers across the country of bullying and intimidating workers and customers in violation of federal law.

Starbucks in two complaints filed with the National Labor Relations Board said the union, Workers United, engaged in unlawful conduct during demonstrations at stores in Phoenix, Arizona and Denver, Colorado.

Workers United has filed petitions to represent Starbucks workers at about 200 U.S. locations, and has won about two dozen elections since December.

Starbucks in the complaints said union organizers have blocked store entrances and exits, made threats and yelled profanities during demonstrations.

""The conduct of Workers United and their agents ... has jeopardized physical safety, caused severe emotional distress, and unlawfully interfered with business operations,"" the company said in the complaints.

Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union, said in a statement that the complaints are a reflection of Starbucks' desperation as an increasing number of workers seek to form unions.

Workers United has filed more than 80 complaints with the NLRB accusing Starbucks of illegal union-busting tactics, including threatening and firing pro-union workers. Starbucks has denied wrongdoing.

Rossann Williams, Starbucks' executive vice president, in a letter to employees obtained by Reuters said the company filed the complaints ""to protect the physical safety and emotional wellbeing of our partners and to make it very clear that the behavior we're seeing from some union organizers is not acceptable and we won't tolerate it.""

The nationwide campaign to unionize Starbucks stores is part of a larger surge in union election petitions filed over the last six months in the United States. Unions are also organizing Amazon.com Inc warehouse workers and Apple Inc retail employees for the first time. read more

89,626,APPLE,2022-04-20,EU plan for common worldwide phone charger port takes step closer,"













BRUSSELS, April 20 (Reuters) - The European Union's bid to adopt a common charging port for mobile phones, tablets and headphones took a step forward on Wednesday when an EU panel backed the proposal, paving the way for an assembly vote next month.

The European Commission suggested a single mobile charging port more than a decade ago, hoping phone makers would be able to find a common solution. It proposed draft legislation last year, a world first, after they failed to do so.

The European Parliament's Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee on Wednesday agreed with the Commission's proposal.

Apple's (AAPL.O) iPhones are charged from a Lightning cable while Android-based devices are powered using USB-C connectors. The majority of phones sold in the EU are Android devices.

""With half a billion chargers for portable devices shipped in Europe each year, generating 11,000 to 13,000 tonnes of e-waste, a single charger for mobile phones and other small and medium electronic devices would benefit everyone,"" said Alex Agius Saliba, who is leading the debate in parliament.

The committee wants the USB Type-C port to be the standard for mobile phones, tablets, headphones, e-readers, low-powered laptops, keyboards, computer mice, earbuds, smart watches and electronic toys.

Apple has said the proposal would hurt innovation and create a mountain of waste if consumers were forced to switch to new chargers.

90,657,APPLE,2022-04-21,Exxon Mobil may completely withdraw from Russia by June 24 - sources,"













LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) is considering a complete withdrawal from Russia by June 24, two sources familiar with plans told Reuters on Thursday, following the U.S. oil major's earlier decision to exit all operations in the country.

Exxon Mobil has not provided a timetable for the withdrawal but last month removed employees who are U.S. citizens from Russia after Moscow launched what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine.

The first departures included staff from its large oil and gas production operations on Sakhalin Island in Russia's Far East, including the Sakhalin 1 project.

""As we announced March 1, we are discontinuing operations and taking steps to exit the Sakhalin-1 venture,"" Exxon spokesperson Casey Norton said in a written statement.

Exxon last year employed more than 1,000 people across Russia, with offices in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and Yuzhno-Sakhalinst, according to its website.

Exxon has also significantly phased down its chemical and lubricant businesses in Russia, and limited sales to existing contractual commitments and essential products used in applications such as food preservation, agriculture and hygiene, the spokesperson said.

The company said it is complying with all sanctions imposed against Russia.

Its deliberations come after dozens of other Western companies - from Apple (AAPL.O) and Boeing (BA.N) to BP (BP.L), Shell and Equinor (EQNR.OL) - that have halted business or announced plans to abandon their Russia operations.

91,193,APPLE,2022-04-21,Apple supplier Unimicron says Kunshan operations partially resume,"













TAIPEI, April 21 (Reuters) - Taiwan's Unimicron Technology Corp (3037.TW) said on Thursday that one of its two plants in eastern China's Kunshan would remain closed to comply with COVID-19 curbs but the other would resume production.

Unimicron, a chip substrate and printed circuit board maker that supplies Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O), said in a statement one plant had resumed some production under a ""closed loop management"" system that keeps workers isolated inside.

A company representative said it was difficult to estimate current production capacity but it was ""not high"".

Unimicron plans to keep one plant closed and the other running under the closed-loop system until next Wednesday.

Most of Unimicron's manufacturing capacity is located in Taiwan but it also has plants in other parts of China as well as in Germany and Japan.

China has put Shanghai under a tight lockdown since late March and neighbouring Kunshan has also tightened curbs to control the country's biggest COVID-19 outbreak since the coronavirus was discovered in late 2019 in the city of Wuhan.

That had caused dozens of Taiwanese firms, many making parts for the semiconductor and electronics industries, to suspend operations. read more

April 21 (Reuters) - A Moscow court on Thursday ruled that it was lawful for Russia's anti-monopoly regulator to open an antitrust case against Apple (AAPL.O) over an App Store payment dispute, dismissing a case brought by the U.S. company, the RIA news agency reported.

Russia began the antitrust case against Apple in October, accusing it of failing to allow app developers to tell customers about alternative payment options when using its App Store. It said Apple could face a fine based on its revenue in Russia if found guilty. read more

Apple and Russia's Federal Anti-monopoly Service (FAS) did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

RIA said the Moscow Arbitration Court had dismissed Apple's case in its entirety. It said the decision can be appealed.

Separately, law firm Chernyshov, Lukoyanov & Partners on Wednesday said it was preparing a lawsuit against Apple for what it said was a violation of Russian consumers' rights after the company restricted the use of Apple Pay on March 1 in response to Russia sending tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24.

The same law firm is behind a similar lawsuit against streaming company Netflix, which in March suspended its service in Russia and said it was temporarily stopping all future projects and acquisitions in the country. read more

93,595,APPLE,2022-04-22,"Taiwan to invest in green energy, smart grids to reach net-zero emissions goal","













TAIPEI, April 22 (Reuters) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said on Friday the government will focus on research and development in green energy, smart grids and energy storage equipment in its push to cut carbon emissions.

""Long-term carbon reduction relies on new technologies to produce more breakthroughs,"" Tsai said at a sustainability forum to mark Earth Day.

""Taiwan's industries are export-oriented. We need to break into the global green supply chain,"" she added.

Taiwan said last year it intended to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and the government has pledged to spend NT$900 billion ($30.7 billion) by 2030 towards that end.

This week, the cabinet approved a draft amendment of climate legislation that includes the 2050 net-zero goal and the introduction of a carbon pricing scheme.

Tsai said that by 2050, renewable energy should account for more than 60% of Taiwan's power supply, while hydrogen should account for around 10% and thermal power generation with carbon capture around 20%.

By comparison, in 2020, coal provided 45% of Taiwan's electricity while liquefied natural gas provided around 36%, government data shows.

Foxconn (2317.TW), the world's largest contract manufacturer and a major Apple supplier, said on Friday it also aims to have net-zero emissions by 2050 and plans to use ""at least 50% green power"" by 2030.

April 22 (Reuters) - Semiconductor maker Broadcom Inc (AVGO.O) is under scrutiny from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission following complaints it is forcing exclusive agreements with customers, The Information reported on Friday.

The FTC is in the early stages of gathering information about whether Broadcom, which has become a major supplier of WiFi and Bluetooth chips to companies like Apple Inc (AAPL.O), illegally forced exclusivity agreements on its customers, the report added.

Broadcom is blaming the supply-chain crisis to justify its demands from customers, the report said, citing people with knowledge of the situation and a document seen by The Information.

The FTC has declined to comment, while Broadcom did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

April 25 (Reuters) - From HSBC and Volvo in Europe to Apple and McDonalds on Wall Street, first-quarter earnings are coming in thick and fast. But will they give lacklustre stock markets a lift?

In France, a Marine Le Pen presidency has not come to pass, with Emmanuel Macron winning the Sunday's election.Now the wait is on to see for another event which in January had seemed impossible -- a Russian sovereign debt default.

Here's a look at the week ahead in markets from Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, Saqib Ahmed in New York, Danilo Masoni in Milan, and Dhara Ranasinghe and Karin Strohecker in London.

1/ VIVE LA FRANCE

French President Emmanuel Macron defeated his far-right rival Marine Le Pen on Sunday by a comfortable margin, securing a second term and heading off what would have been a political earthquake. read more

The news is a relief for markets, boosting the euro, French bonds and stocks. But gains will likely be short-lived, as focus returns to the outlook for tighter ECB policy and the outcome of French parliamentary elections in June. read more

That Macron's problems are far from over, was shown late on Sunday when riot police charged and sprayed teargas on people protesting in central Paris after the election.

2/ TRUE DOVE

Ahead of Thursday's policy meeting, the Bank of Japan has left no doubt about its commitment to supercharged stimulus, leaping into markets to defend its 0% bond yield target -- even at the expense of a plunging currency.

The contrast between the BOJ and the hawkish Federal Reserve is at the heart of the yen's tumble to a two-decade trough near 130 per dollar .

The yen's 11% fall in the course of a month has prompted warnings from finance minister Shunichi Suzuki against rapid depreciation, putting markets on alert for an intervention. But BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has stuck to the view that yen weakness overall is a positive for Japan.

The IMF seems to agree. A senior official said yen moves were down to fundamentals and there was no need to change policy, including the BOJ's ultra-low rate stance read more .

3/ TECH TROUBLE

It's been a gloomy year so far for U.S. stocks and for tech firms, and the ongoing results season could make it worse.

Netflix's share rout after reporting falling subscriber numbers has sparked trepidation about upcoming earnings from Facebook-parent Meta (FB.O), Google-parent Alphabet . Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) read more .

This so-called FAANG grouping benefited hugely from the low-rate, work-from-home environment. But with interest rates on the rise, their shares have cumulatively lost some $2.5 trillion in market value this year.

Overall S&P 500 earnings are projected to expand 6.3%. But Apple quarterly adjusted earnings-per-share are seen growing by just 2% versus the year-ago period, while a 0.7% dip is expected at Alphabet. And EPS declines at Amazon and Meta could be as much as 49% and 24% respectively, Refinitiv data shows.

4/ EUROPE INC: EARNINGS AND INFLATION

As the Ukraine war rages, European companies' full-year earnings revisions -- the number of upgrades minus downgrades -- have turned negative the first time since October 2020 read more .

Q1 earnings growth will still be 25%, Refinitiv projects, possibly enough to lift a bearishly positioned market. Yet, with more than 140 companies unveiling earnings during the April 25-29 week, there are questions over cost pressures and whether these can be passed to consumers.

Giants such as Nestle (NESN.S) and Danone (DANO.PA) managed to grow Q1 earnings while raising prices, but smaller peers may struggle to do so read more .

Leading banks, including UBS, Deutsche, HSBC and Barclays also report; after a disappointing Q1 share performance, the prospect of higher rates is now lifting the sector.

96,459,APPLE,2022-04-22,Wall St Week Ahead Stakes are high as megacap companies highlight big earnings week,"













NEW YORK, April 22 (Reuters) - Investors are hoping a flood of U.S. quarterly reports next week, including those from megacap growth titans, will confirm a solid profit outlook for corporate America and bolster the case for stocks after a rocky start to the year.

Nearly 180 companies in the S&P 500, worth roughly half of the benchmark index's market value, are due to report results next week. They include the four biggest U.S. companies by market capitalization: Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O).

The latest round of earnings comes amid a backdrop of hawkishness from the Federal Reserve and a rapid rise in bond yields that has sparked unease about whether policymakers will damage the economy as they fight the worst inflation in nearly four decades. The S&P 500 has moved lower in April and was down 10.4% so far this year after a sharp selloff on Friday. read more

With monetary policy weighing on stocks, bullish investors are counting on a solid corporate outlook to support markets, ratcheting up pressure on companies to report solid bottom-line results and forecasts. S&P 500 companies are estimated to increase earnings by 9% this year, according to Refinitiv IBES.

“It’s probably the strongest argument you can make for owning stocks at this point, that corporate profits are still very robust,” said Charlie Ryan, portfolio manager at Evercore Wealth Management. ""Any degradation in corporate profit growth and the cadence of that would spook the market.”

So far, investors have been quick to punish shares of companies with disappointing results, particularly those that carry expensive valuations. One recent casualty has been Netflix (NFLX.O), whose shares tumbled around 35% in a single session after the streaming giant reported its first drop in subscribers in a decade.

Though stocks have declined year-to-date, the S&P 500 still has been trading at about 19 times forward earnings estimates, above its long-term average of 15.5 times.

“We are in a show-me type of environment. I think next week is critical for tech and high growth names, especially the higher valuation stocks,"" said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise. ""They better prove that they deserve these multiples right now.”

Investors will zero in on results from Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, which combined have a market value of about $8 trillion and make up one-fifth of the weight of the S&P 500. All of those megacap stocks have declined this year, with Apple down about 9%, Amazon off 13.4%, Alphabet down 17.4% and Microsoft falling 18.5%.

Earnings expectations for these companies are subdued for the quarter ended in March. Microsoft is expected to have increased adjusted earnings per share by 12% from the year-earlier period, Apple by 2%, while Alphabet is seen posting a 0.7% dip and Amazon reporting a 49% drop, according to Refinitiv data. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to increase quarterly earnings by 7.3%.

“Expectations are low, but that doesn’t mean it’s not important,"" said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson. ""If we are going to hit that 9% (earnings growth) for the year or even better than that, it’s hard to imagine we are going to do that without having better-than-expected earnings from the megacap companies.”

Aside from the top four firms, results are due next week from a range of companies including Facebook owner Meta Platforms (FB.O), payment companies Visa (V.N) and Mastercard (MA.N), oil majors Chevron (CVX.N) and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), and consumer companies Coca-Cola (KO.N) and Pepsico (PEP.O).

Beyond the bottom line results and financial outlooks, investors also will be looking to see if companies can maintain their profit margins as inflation threatens to drive up their input costs. S&P 500 companies should see net income margins dip to about 13% in 2022 from a record 13.4% last year, JPMorgan said in a note this week.

Of 99 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far, 77.8% reported earnings above analysts expectations, Refinitiv IBES said. That rate is above the typical beat rate of 66% for a quarter since 1994, but below the 83% rate over the past four quarters.

“The stock market is ... waiting for this barrage of earnings,"" Saglimbene said. The market is “beholden to what companies say about the second quarter and beyond.”

WASHINGTON, April 25 (Reuters) - The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) said Monday it is seeking public comments on competition in the mobile app ecosystem as plan to send a report to the White House.

The Commerce Department agency wants input by May 23 on ""the factors affecting app development and distribution, and active ways to increase competition, through government or private sector action."" In February, a Senate panel approved a bill to rein in app stores of companies they said exert too much market control, particularly Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O).

NTIA noted that by one estimate the app economy was valued at $1.7 trillion in 2020, employing more than 5.9 million Americans.

98,784,APPLE,2022-04-26,Chipmaker Texas Instruments expects revenue hit as China lockdowns dent demand,"













April 26 (Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O) forecast second-quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates on Tuesday, hit by reduced demand due to COVID-19 lockdowns in China, sending its shares down 7% in extended trading.

China has put Shanghai under a lockdown since late March and neighboring city Kunshan has also tightened curbs to control the country's biggest COVID-19 outbreak since late 2019.

It has caused dozens of Taiwanese firms, many making parts for the semiconductor and electronics industries, including Apple suppliers, to suspend operations.

The chipmaker said the issues were primarily due to disruptions at the factories of its customers and not due to shipping or distribution problems, adding its own factories have been running at high levels of utilization.

""It just became clear we were experiencing lower demand, particularly due to COVID-19 restrictions in China,"" Dave Pahl, head of IR at Texas Instruments, said.

""We continue to see expedites for deliveries. However, we did see that our customers' manufacturing operations were being impacted,"" he added.

Texas Instruments expects second-quarter revenue to be between $4.20 billion and $4.80 billion, compared with analysts' expectations of $4.94 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

""This will likely reverberate throughout the industry as investors try to get a firmer grasp of the impact,"" Logan Purk from brokerage Edward Jones said, adding this situation is tied to a significant wild card of how long these lockdowns will last in China.

Purk, however, expects the chip shortage to continue through the summer and improve as more capacity comes on line in the fall.

Last year, when demand for electronics, including smartphones and consumer gadgets, rose, many semiconductor makers doubled down on production.

For the first quarter, Texas Instruments' revenue rose 14% to $4.91 billion. Analysts were expecting revenue of $4.74 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

99,591,APPLE,2022-04-26,Samsung Elec to join renewables pledge as S.Korea shifts gears on green energy,"













April 27 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plans to join as soon as next month a group of global corporations committed to 100% renewable energy, a person familiar with the matter said, as partners such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O) push it for action against climate change.

Samsung, the world's biggest chipmaker, is late to the green power pledge: It's been two years since hometown rival SK Hynix (000660.KS) joined the RE100 initiative, which sets a 2050 target for 100% renewable electricity, while global peers including Apple, TSMC (2330.TW) and Intel (INTC.O) are already among its 350 members.

The timing of the cautious company's announcement, expected as early as the May 10 inauguration of South Korea's new president, will bring it on board just as the country's energy policy is set for a grand U-turn: away from the prior administration's aggressive push into renewables, and towards a pro-nuclear stance.

""It will be a group-wide announcement that also includes affiliates such as Samsung Display,"" said a person with direct knowledge of the matter.

""The entire group will announce its climate goals including RE100 around when the new administration kicks off,"" the source said, asking not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.

The source added that Samsung had discussed with President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol's transition committee the regulations and hurdles that discourage the use of renewable energy.

Samsung declined to comment, while the CDP, an environmental non-profit organisation that brings together companies seeking to join RE100, said only that an announcement was expected this year.

""Samsung Electronics told us that it has notified its foreign investors that it would join and announce RE100 within this year,"" Kim Tae-han, a senior researcher at the CDP Korean committee, told Reuters.

Yoon has also tapped Han Hwa-jin, a climate specialist and outside director at Samsung, to serve as his government's environment minister.

The timing of Samsung's RE100 announcement could depend in part on the appointment of Han's replacement on the board.

""Samsung needs the legitimacy of all outside directors being present and approving the announcement,"" said Lee Jong-oh, director at Korea Sustainability Investing Forum.

RISK OF INACTION

Samsung has long acknowledged the risk of inaction on climate change, estimating based on 2020 revenue that up to 25.8 trillion won ($20.6 billion), or 20%, of its business-to-business sales such as chips could be lost if it does not switch to renewable energy.

""Our customers are demanding to produce products using 100% renewable energy to achieve their goals. There is an evident risk that our sales may be affected if these demands are not met,"" Samsung said in a statement posted on CDP's website in 2021.

It's not just B2B customers like Apple, which buys its chips, or consumers who buy its Galaxy smartphones who are concerned about Samsung's action on climate.

BlackRock, the fourth-largest institutional investor in Samsung according to Eikon data, said in a voting bulletin at its annual shareholders' meeting last month that investors had only limited access to information on Samsung's green strategies. It also criticised the board for a lack of urgency on climate issues.

Samsung Electronics has already been running its chip factories in China and the United States 100% with renewable electricity since 2019, but they accounted for just 10.7% of its total global energy consumption in 2020.

Its chip factories in South Korea accounted for 63.5% of its total global electricity use in 2020, and most of its $51.6 billion in profit last year, but ran almost entirely on non-renewable power.

It is building its third chip factory in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, and three more are planned for the city. Once completed, they are projected to consume 21.6 TWh per year, exceeding the entire electricity consumption of Busan, South Korea's second-largest city with 3.3 million people, according to an opposition lawmaker. Samsung did not dispute the figure.

This raises the stakes for Samsung's profitability in South Korea's energy policy.

While environmental groups have argued that an aggressive shift to renewables is necessary to promote economies of scale, Sonn Yang-hoon, an economics professor at Incheon National University, said Yoon's more cautious, pro-nuclear approach would help to stabilise electricity prices and let Samsung sustain profitability while moving towards renewables.

""Nuclear power will buy time until renewable energy gets cheaper with technological breakthroughs,"" Sonn said. ""Samsung will bide its time until renewable energy prices drop before it carries out RE100 at full throttle.""

The Korea Energy Economics Institute estimates the price of solar and wind power will fall as much as 55% and 44%, respectively, by 2030 from 2020.

Yoon, who won the March 9 presidential election by the smallest margin in South Korea's democratic history, aims for an energy mix of 20-25% renewables and 30-35% nuclear by 2030, compared with his predecessor's target of 70% from renewables and only 6% from nuclear by 2050.

Nuclear power accounted for 29% and renewable energy 6.6% in 2020, Electric Power Statistics Information System data showed.

100,492,APPLE,2022-04-27,Qualcomm forecasts upbeat revenue as diversification bet pays off,"[1/3] A Qualcomm sign is shown outside one of the company's many buildings in San Diego, California, U.S., September 17, 2020. REUTERS/Mike Blake















April 27 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) forecast third-quarter revenue above analyst expectations after beating second quarter revenue and profit estimates on Wednesday, largely due to its move to focus on a growing non-handset business to cushion a likely hit from slowing smartphone demand.

The robust earnings outlook and record quarterly revenue for the last quarter immediately pushed Qualcomm shares up about 5% in after-hours trading.

Lockdowns in China, war in Ukraine and rising inflation has taken a toll on consumers, preventing them from spending on electronic gadgets like phones. However, Qualcomm has not been affected so far.

""The market in China is changing a bit. I think we're kind of less impacted by it because we're really focused on the premium and high-tier"" smartphone market, Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon told Reuters.

Runar Bjørhovde, an analyst at research firm Canalys, said smartphone makers will want to focus on selling more profitable high-end phones as the supply chain constrains production, while consumers will want to buy cheap phones as inflation and uncertainty hold them back from spending.

He said the ""sweet spot"" will be in the mid-range devices ($300-$800), where Qualcomm has a strong hold and excellent partnerships with the vendors who dominate this market segment.

Qualcomm's strong results coupled with Meta Platforms' (FB.O) surprising profit beat pushed Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) shares up about 1% in after-hours trading, providing glimmers of hope for a solid showing when the iPhone maker reveals results on Thursday.

""These (Qualcomm) results lay the foundation to make a strong case that the smartphone business is still strong after the traditionally big holiday quarter,"" said Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, adding that Qualcomm derives 25% of its sales from making modem solutions for Apple.

But Apple is working on its own chips to replace Qualcomm's. Analysts have said Qualcomm is preparing for the inevitable.

""Qualcomm is certainly relying on the Android market, leaning into it heavily as they anticipate losing Apple's business for its modem chips. Within Android, Samsung is the clear leader in premium handsets, and will likely be an important customer for Qualcomm in the future,"" said Logan Purk, an analyst at Edward Jones.

In the company's earnings call, Amon said he expects the ""relationship with Samsung only to increase,"" adding that in the latest Samsung Galaxy S22 smartphone about 75% of the high-end chips were Qualcomm chips, up from about 40% in Samsung's last phone, and replacing Samsung chips.

Still to reduce its dependence on handsets, Qualcomm has been diversifying its revenue streams by catering to other markets including automotive.

For example, Qualcomm's automotive business pipeline is now at $16 billion, up from $13 billion late last year, mostly thanks to a deal it struck recently with automaker Stellantis, said Amon. read more

Revenue from chips catering to automotive and internet-powered gadgets rose 41% and 61%, respectively, during the second quarter, while revenue from its mainstay handset business rose 56%, helped by the new Snapdragon launch.

Amon also told Reuters that Qualcomm is open to participating in an IPO by Arm Ltd, which makes blueprints that chipmakers, including Qualcomm, use to design chips. SoftBank Group Corp(9984.T) owns the British chip technology company.

Qualcomm forecast current-quarter revenue between a range of $10.5 billion and $11.3 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $9.98 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Adjusted revenue for the quarter ended March 27 was $11.16 billion, above estimates of $10.6 billion.

Excluding items, Qualcomm earned $3.21 per share, beating estimates of $2.91.

101,380,APPLE,2022-04-27,LG Display quarterly profit plunges as demand shrinks and prices slide,"













SEOUL, April 27 (Reuters) - LG Display Co Ltd (034220.KS) saw first-quarter profit plummet far below forecasts and warned of a further drop in panel prices as pandemic-driven demand for TVs, smartphones and laptops fades and competition heats up.

The South Korean Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier said it would shift its focus to higher-end products and gradually lower production of more commoditised LCD TV panels where it lacked a competitive advantage over cheaper Chinese rivals.

The LCD TV market shrank by more than 10% in the first quarter and Chinese competitors are pricing their products lower than LG Display's expectations, Lee Tai-jong, head of the company's large display marketing division, said on a call with analysts.

First-quarter operating profit slid 93% to 38 billion won ($30 million), undershooting a Refinitiv SmartEstimate of 182 billion won and marking its lowest quarterly operating profit since the second quarter of 2020.

China's COVID-19 lockdowns also caused supply chain problems that affected panel production and shipments.

LG Display shares extended falls after the earnings were announced to close 3.9% lower, versus the wider market's (.KS11) 1.1% decline.

""Margins have been squeezed chiefly due to panel price declines and weaker demand, as consumers have already bought many screens during COVID-19 in the past two years,"" said Kim Yang-jae, an analyst at DAOL Investment & Securities.

Chinese rival BOE Technology Group Co Ltd (000725.SZ) has been tapped to also supply Apple with display screens, said a source with knowledge of the matter.

The source was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified. LG Display declined to comment on client matters. BOE and Apple did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

In the first quarter, prices of 55-inch liquid crystal display (LCD) panels for TV sets fell 16% from the previous quarter while prices of LCD panels for notebooks and monitors dropped by around 7% to 11%, according to data from TrendForce's WitsView.

102,311,APPLE,2022-04-27,Apple's main investor concern this quarter: demand,"













April 27 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) investors have for years cheered investments to expand its supply chain to meet feverish global demand for iPhone and MacBooks. Now, the question is whether the company can sell everything it made.

Rising costs for fuel, groceries and other essentials in the U.S., Europe and Asia has spurred concerns about lower consumer spending on tech gadgets, and Wall Street now is uncertain whether Apple can sell as many iPhones as it did last year.

Apple reports fiscal second-quarter results on Thursday.

""Demand is the focus, given the inflation pressure in United States, global and China's economy uncertainties... Supply issue is important too, but it is more short term,"" said Jeff Pu, an analyst at Haitong International Tech Research.

In China, the world's largest smartphone consumer market, total industry phone shipments this year are expected to be 300 million units from about 325 million units last year, according to research provider Trendforce, which expects more deterioration as China's economy takes a hit from strict COVID-19 curbs and the Ukraine war.

To grow its footprint elsewhere in China, which generates at least a fifth of Apple's revenue, the company in March launched a low-cost 5G iPhone SE to woo consumers looking to upgrade on a budget. But that plan might not succeed as fewer consumers plan upgrades, according to Counterpoint Research's Jeff Fieldhack.

Demand for 5G phones is expected to dwindle in China, too, as consumers limit spending to everyday essentials amid slowing economic growth.

""When we sit here half a year from now, we'll probably say that this was the quarter where there's this new wave of headwinds that came in and shifted the market around,"" Canalys analyst Runar Bjørhovde said. ""It's commencing a lot of challenges that will come up in the next few quarters.""

To be sure, Apple, a pandemic winner as demand for its iPhones, MacBooks and services surged, still grew market share last year due to the popularity of its iPhone 13 series.

Apple is expected to report revenue of $93.89 billion for its fiscal second quarter, a 4.8% rise, but its slowest growth rate in six quarters. Sales of iPhones, where Apple gets most of its revenue, are expected to fall slightly to $47.88 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Though Apple lost out on billions of dollars in sales last year due to product shortages, it escaped much of the supply issues that plagued other tech companies, thanks to its buying power, and the company's ability to place custom orders for components used in its products.

It also prioritized manufacturing more expensive, high-margin products. Apple forecast that those supply issues would continue to decrease in its second quarter, another reason why analysts have shifted focus to the demand side.

103,829,APPLE,2022-04-27,STMicro CEO says chip demand to exceed group capacity all year,"Summary

Summary Companies Q1 beat markets expectations

Group confirms full-year sales target

Orders are about 30-40% above group capacity-CEO















PARIS, April 27 (Reuters) - Demand for semi-condutors will exceed STMicroelectronics' capacity for the rest of the year, the boss of the Franco-Italian chipmaker said on Wednesday, as the disruption of COVID-19 and war in Ukraine overshadows the sector.

The combination of conflict and renewed lockdowns has already affected some of STMicro's bigger peers, such as Texas Instruments (TXN.O), adding to concerns over STMicro's ability to meet earlier stated targets. read more

""Our sales and operating plan show our capacity fully saturated above 90% for the full remaining year,"" Chief Executive Officer Jean-Marc Chery told analysts in a call.

Geneva-based STMicro lost two weeks' worth of production at its plant in Shenzhen, China, in the first quarter because of a lockdown, Chery said.

However, the group was able to transfer some of the production to other plants, helping it to beat market expectations for sales of microcontrollers, he added.

Chery said that recorded orders for its chips were 30% to 40% above the capacity of the group, whose biggest clients include iPhone maker Apple (AAPL.O) and electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA.O).

STMicro's shares dipped in and out of positive territory, reflecting investors uncertainty about its business outlook.

""Investors remain highly sceptical of trends into 2023, where we have recently lowered our expectations, factoring in a global economic slowdown and, therefore, a downcycle in semis,"" Citi said in a note to clients.

STMicro said its first-quarter sales came slightly above its targets at $3.55 billion for a gross margin of 46.7%, and beat the $3.49 billion average of seven analysts' estimate compiled by Refinitiv.

Diluted earnings per share over the period were $0.79, above Refinitiv's mean analyst estimate of 71 cents per share.

STMicro forecast its revenue in 2022 to be in the range of $14.8 billion to $15.3 billion. It expects second-quarter net revenue to be about $3.75 billion, reflecting 5.8% growth compared with the first quarter.

April 28 (Reuters) - Shares of Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) rose 17% in a relief rally on Thursday after having lost nearly half their value this year, as the social media giant surprised Wall Street with a better-than-expected rise in users joining the platform.

The stock helped lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq in premarket trading, spreading cheer to several internet and technology names. Apple, Amazon and Alphabet were all up more than 2%.

""Investors seem to be clamoring for good news and Meta's results coming within touching distance of expectations scratched that itch,"" said Laura Hoy, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

Analysts appeared mixed in their views on the results. At least five brokerages cut their price targets on the stock, while three raised their expectations.

Of the 63 analysts covering the stock, 46 have a ""buy"" or higher rating and only two analysts rate the stock ""sell"" or lower. The median price target on the stock is $300, well above its current trading price of $200.

Facebook's daily active users (DAU), a key metric for advertisers, came in at 1.96 billion, slightly higher than the estimate of 1.95 billion.

While that was enough to send the shares soaring, Wall Street analysts took a more cautious tone, citing worries ranging from the war in Ukraine, Apple's App Store policy changes to competition from ByteDance's TikTok.

""We do not believe the overall FB business has changed much over the past 90 days, but headwinds related to iOS changes, TikTok competition & Reels monetization are better understood,"" J.P Morgan's lead analyst Doug Anmuth said in a note.

105,610,APPLE,2022-04-28,Honor sees gains as China smartphone sales drop 14% on year in Q1,"













SHENZHEN, China, April 28 (Reuters) - Former Huawei unit Honor posted the fastest growth in China's smartphone market in the first quarter, even as overall handset sales fell 14% year-on-year to levels close to those seen in the pandemic-ravaged first quarter of 2020.

Android handset brands Vivo and Oppo, both under the privately owned BBK Electronics, claimed the largest share of first quarter sales, with 19.7% and 18% of the market respectively, research firm Counterpoint Research said.

Apple (AAPL.O), which was China's top-selling vendor in the previous quarter for the first time in six years thanks to the release of the iPhone 13, was the third-largest seller in Q1, claiming 17.9% of the market.

Honor made the biggest gains in Q1, taking the fourth biggest slice of sales with 16.9%, with sales up 15.5% on the previous quarter. Huawei Technologies (HWT.UL) sold its Honor unit in December 2020 to a consortium of agents and dealers as U.S. sanctions crippled the parent's smartphone sales.

Huawei, once China's best selling brand, held 6.2% of the market in the first quarter.

Chinese retail sales lagged in the key coastal economic regions of Guangdong and Jiangsu in the first quarter, with areas hit by COVID-19 outbreaks also showing particular weakness, regional data showed. read more

107,127,APPLE,2022-04-28,Apple sees bigger supply problems after strong start to year,"













OAKLAND, Calif., April 28 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Thursday forecast bigger problems as COVID-19 lockdowns snarl production and demand in China, the war in Ukraine dents sales and growth slows in services, which the iPhone maker sees as its engine for expansion.

Shares were down 2.2% in late trade after executives laid out their glum outlook on a conference call. The news outweighed record profit and sales for Apple's fiscal second quarter, which ended in March.

Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri warned in an interview that the war in Ukraine, which led Apple to stop sales in Russia, would cut sales more deeply in the fiscal third quarter.

He told analysts on the call that supply-chain issues would hurt sales in the quarter by $4 billion to $8 billion, ""substantially larger"" than the hit in the second quarter.

Supply problems were focused on a corridor in Shanghai, China and reflected COVID disruptions and chip shortages, he added. The pandemic was also affecting demand in China, he said.

Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that almost all of the Chinese factories doing final assembly of Apple products had restarted after recent COVID shutdowns, but the company is not forecasting when the chips shortage, mostly affecting older products, would end.

Cook said he hoped COVID issues would be ""transitory"" and ""get better over time.""

At least one analyst said the outlook lacked clarity.

""We were all looking for just better guidance on what is really going on over there (China) ... and that didn't come out,"" said Louis Navellier, chief investment officer for Navellier & Associates.

Kim Caughey Forrest, Chief Investment Officer at Bokeh Capital Partners, said that ongoing demand remained a big question, despite Apple's management of supply chain in the March quarter.

Indeed, other high-profile tech companies also raised concerns. Amazon (AMZN.O) on Thursday posted a disappointing outlook as it was swamped by higher costs, sending its shares down 9% after the close, and Intel Corp (INTC.O) forecast a bleak quarter based on supply chain issues, and its stock fell 4%.

Both companies, along with Apple, are part of the broader Nasdaq index, which has fallen nearly 19% this year as rising inflation drives investors elsewhere.

Apple's overall fiscal second-quarter revenue was $97.3 billion, up 8.6% from last year and higher than analysts' average estimate of $93.89 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Worldwide phone sales revenue was $50.6 billion, a 5.5% increase from a year ago, and services sales rose 17% to $19.8 billion, both ahead of analyst average forecasts.

However, Maestri said that services growth would decelerate from the March quarter, while remaining in double-digits. He cited several factors, including more unfavorable currency exchange rates.

Total profit was $25 billion, or $1.52 per share and easily topped analysts' expectations of $23.2 billion and $1.43.

Apple also raised its dividend 5% to $0.23 per share and the board approved a buyback for an added $90 billion in shares.

Investors have been bracing for drops in consumer spending on tech gadgets and services as the war in Ukraine and other factors drive up the cost of oil, food and other staples.

Cook shrugged off an analyst question on inflation and consumers.

""We're monitoring that closely. But right now, our main focus, frankly speaking, is on the supply side,"" he said.

Asked about rising inflation, Maestri said demand, particularly for iPhones, had been higher than the company had anticipated at the start of the quarter. But he noted inflation was affecting expenses.

The pandemic, including the shift to hybrid work, has benefited other businesses.

Apple said iPad sales fell 2% to $7.65 billion due to supply-chain constraints, while revenue from Mac computers, also facing supply-chain issues, rose 14.7% to $10.4 billion.

Sales of wearables, home speakers and accessories rose 12% to $8.8 billion, and was the only unit to miss Wall Street targets. Maestri said Watch and AirPods sold well, and attributed the miss to seasonal variability in demand for other accessories.

Apple said it now has 825 million paying subscribers across its at least seven subscription offerings, up by 40 million from 785 million last quarter. Its growth comes as rivals such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) report subscriber losses.

Summary Companies Amazon tumbles after results and outlook fall short

Apple slips after flagging supply problems

Monthly inflation surged by the most since 2005

Indexes end: S&P 500 -3.63%, Nasdaq -4.17%, Dow -2.77%















April 29 (Reuters) - Wall Street slid on Friday to its deepest daily losses since 2020, as Amazon slumped following a gloomy quarterly report, and as the biggest surge in monthly inflation since 2005 spooked investors already worried about rising interest rates.

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) tumbled 14.05% in its steepest one-day drop since 2006, leaving the widely held stock near two-year lows. Late on Thursday, the e-commerce giant delivered a disappointing quarter and outlook, swamped by higher costs.

Apple Inc (AAPL.O), the world's most valuable company, dropped 3.66% after its disappointing outlook overshadowed record quarterly profit and sales.

All 11 S&P 500 sector indexes fell, led lower by a 5.9% slide in Consumer Discretionary (.SPLRCD) and a 4.9% drop in Real Estate (.SPLRCR).

The S&P 500 logged it largest one-day decline since June 2020. The Nasdaq's decline was its largest since September 2020.

Downbeat results and worries about aggressive monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve have hammered megacap technology and growth stocks this month.

The Fed is set to meet next week, with traders betting on a 50-basis-point rate hike to combat surging inflation.

Ahead of the weekend and the Fed meeting next week, ""people are clearing the decks. The disappointing guidance from Apple and Amazon and a few other companies set the stage yesterday for today to be weak and it accelerated as we ended out the day,"" said Peter Tuz, President of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.

The Nasdaq (.IXIC) has lost about 13% in April, its worst monthly performance since the global financial crisis in 2008.

The S&P 500 has fallen 13% so far in 2022, its steepest four-month decline to start any year since 1939.

Adding to fears on Wall Street, data showed the personal consumption expenditures price index - the Fed's favored measure of inflation - shot up 0.9% in March after climbing 0.5% in February. read more

Signs of aggressive monetary policy tightening, the Ukraine war and China's COVID lockdowns have fueled fears of an economic slowdown. Data on Thursday showed the U.S. economy unexpectedly contracted in the first quarter. read more

The, S&P 500 declined 3.63% to end the session at 4,131.93 points.

The Nasdaq declined 4.17% to 12,334.64 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 2.77% to 32,977.21 points.

For the week, the S&P 500 lost 3.3%, the Nasdaq shed 3.9% and the Dow declined 2.5%.

S&P 500's busiest trades

The S&P 500 has gained or lost 2% or more in a day some 33 times so far in 2022, compared to 24 such days in all of 2021.

Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) slipped 2.24% after it took a $3.4 billion writedown due to its exit from Russia. Chevron Corp (CVX.N) dropped 3.16% after its first-quarter profit underwhelmed. read more

The first-quarter earnings season overall has been better than expected so far. Nearly half of the S&P 500 companies have reported through Thursday and 81% of them have topped Wall Street's expectations. Typically, only 66% beat estimates, according to Refinitiv data.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.91-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.85-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 2 new 52-week highs and 47 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 13 new highs and 385 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.4 billion shares, compared with an 11.8 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

April 29 (Reuters) - A Russian law firm on Friday said it had filed a lawsuit against U.S. tech giant Apple (AAPL.O) seeking 90 million roubles ($1.28 million) in damages for consumers affected by Apple withdrawing its payment service from Russia.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Law firm Chernyshov, Lukoyanov & Partners said Apple had violated Russian consumers' rights after the company restricted the use of its built-in Apple Pay service on March 1 in response to Moscow sending troops into Ukraine.

The lawsuit, which it said had been filed with a Moscow court, is seeking 90 million roubles in damages, which it said included compensation for ""moral damage"" caused to citizens.

It also wants Apple to resume operation of Apple Pay services for Russian users.

The total figure could rise as the law firm is still inviting more claimants to join the suit.

Senior Partner Konstantin Lukoyanov said Apple's main U.S. company had made the decision to suspend sales of Apple products and restrict services offered in Russia.

""Therefore, our lawsuit's claims are directed firstly at the parent company and secondly at its subsidiary units,"" he said in a statement.

The law firm said Apple's decision to halt Apple Pay services in Russia had reduced the functionality of its devices sold on the local market, thereby lowering their value, actions it said were unfair and discriminatory under Russian law.

The same law firm is pursuing a similar lawsuit against streaming company Netflix, which in March suspended its service in Russia. read more

110,539,APPLE,2022-04-29,Morning Bid: Something's off,"













A look at the day ahead in markets from Julien Ponthus.

It's the final day of trading of April and it does look like despite the fireworks on Wall Street last night, this month bears sombre omens for what's to come, notably with Asian shares on the verge of their worst month since the COVID-19 March 2020 crash.

It's even worse for the Nasdaq (.NDX) which is on course for its biggest losses in a month since the financial crisis of 2008.

For all the enthusiasm surrounding the earnings of Meta Platforms (FB.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O) delivered a disappointing quarter while Apple (AAPL.O) had dire news to share with the market after the bell, despite record profits and sales. read more

COVID-19 lockdowns snarl production and demand in China and the iPhone maker warned that the war in Ukraine, which led Apple to stop sales in Russia, would cut sales more deeply in the fiscal third quarter.

Overall, the S&P 500 has had a terrible ride so far in 2022, losing roughly 10% of its value, wiping off four trillion dollars in market capitalisation.

And it's hard to ignore the dotcom bubble flavoured 'irrational exuberance' whiff that surrounds Elon Musk's $44 billion cash deal for Twitter, particularly when the social media reported revenue and ad sales that fell short of expectations. read more

There's also been plenty of puzzling market moves lately. The dollar enjoyed its best month in a decade and hit its highest level in 20 years but data showed the U.S. economy unexpectedly contracted in the first quarter. read more

Of course, with investors betting on a 50 basis point interest rate hike at the Federal Reserve's meeting next week, a U.S. aggressive monetary tightening remains the driving force across financial markets for the foreseeable future.

In that light, it is not surprising that a warning from Japan's Ministry of Finance failed to deter the dollar from cruising above 130 yen for the first time since 2002.

Perhaps not surprising either that the euro, weakened by the Russian gas standoff, also felt the might of the greenback and fell to a five-year low of $1.04 even as 10-year German bund yields rose 10 basis points with German inflation hitting its highest level in more than 40 years.

Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Friday:

-French economic growth stalls in first quarter, misses forecasts read more

-BASF confirms earnings guidance but flags risks

-Danske Bank Q1 net profit below expectations read more

-Swiss National Bank's annual general meeting of shareholders

April 29 (Reuters) - Former U.S. president Donald Trump posted a brief message on Truth Social late Thursday for the first time since the app he founded launched two months ago, saying ""I'M BACK!""

Trump broke his silence as Elon Musk sealed a $44 billion deal to buy Twitter, which last year permanently banned Trump citing a risk of further violence following the Jan. 6, 2021 siege by a pro-Trump mob on the U.S. Capitol. read more

Republicans cheered Musk's buyout of the social media platform in the hope that the Tesla Inc(TSLA.O) Chief Executive, who has vowed to relax content moderation practices to restore free speech, will invite Trump back to the site. read more

Since the deal was announced this week, Trump has said he would not return to Twitter.

In Thursday's message, called a ""truth"" on the app, Trump wrote, ""I'M BACK! #COVFEFE"", referencing a typo on a Twitter message he sent while president that complained about the press and was widely memed.

Trump's silence on his own app since the launch of Truth Social on Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) app store on Feb. 21 has raised questions about its long term viability.

Ahead of its launch, his son Donald Trump Jr. tweeted a screenshot of his father’s Truth Social account with one “truth” that he posted on Feb. 14, verified at the account of @reaDonaldTrump, with the message: “Get Ready! Your favorite President will see you soon!”

Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), Truth Social's parent company, is planning to go public through a merger with blank-check firm Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC.O), shares of which were up 7.7% pre-market Friday.

The deal is under scrutiny by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and is likely months away from being finalized.

Tech names stage late-afternoon rally

Indexes gain: Dow 0.26%, S&P 0.57%, Nasdaq 1.63%















May 2 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes closed a seesaw session higher on Monday, as investors bought in to technology names in the last hour of trading amid bets they had been overly beaten down ahead of this week's Federal Reserve meeting.

The gathering of U.S. central bank policymakers is widely expected to raise interest rates by half a percentage point, with this week's move expected to kick off a period of aggressive rate hikes to counter inflation.

Nervousness heading into the meeting was reflected in a topsy-turvy session for U.S. equities. After positive moves to start the day, the S&P 500 fell to its lowest intraday point since May 2021, and the Nasdaq touched a level last seen in November 2020.

The jitters were also seen in the market for U.S. Treasuries, where the ten-year benchmark breached 3% for the first time in more than three years.

As well as positioning themselves for the expected rate hike, traders were also looking to the launch of ""quantitative tightening,"" where the central bank reduces its balance sheet after buying bonds to support the economy during the pandemic. read more

However, earlier declines were used as a buying opportunity by some in the latter part of the session to drag all three indexes into positive territory.

""We're at a point in the market now where so much of it, across various sectors, is beaten down,"" said Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer of Defiance ETF.

""I think the market has priced in what the Fed will be able to do, so my sense - as someone who likes to look for long-term opportunities - is that this is the land of opportunity right now.""

Jablonski pointed to megacap technology names, which stand to remain key parts of the economy for years to come, as being ""on sale"".

High-growth stocks such as tech have been pummeled this year as a result of traders adjusting for the higher interest-rate environment, with losses accentuated in recent days by a number of disappointing earnings reports.

After spending much of the day in the red, Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) all ended between 0.2% and 3.7% higher.

Apple had been weighed down for much of Monday as the iPhone maker faced a possible hefty fine after EU antitrust regulators charged it with restricting rivals' access to its technology used for mobile wallets. read more

113,777,APPLE,2022-05-02,EU's Vestager assessing if tech giants should share telecoms network costs,"













BRUSSELS, May 2 (Reuters) - Tech giants such as Google (GOOGL.O), Meta (FB.O) and Netflix (NFLX.O) may have to bear some of the cost of Europe's telecoms network, Europe's digital chief Margrethe Vestager said on Monday, following EU telecoms operators' complaints.

""I think there is an issue that we need to consider with a lot of focus, and that is the issue of fair contribution to telecommunication networks,"" Vestager told a news conference.

""Because we see that there are players who generate a lot of traffic that then enables their business but who have not been contributing actually to enable that traffic. They have not been contributing to enabling the investments in the rollout of connectivity,"" she said.

""And we are in the process of getting a thorough understanding of how could that be enabled,"" Vestager said, adding that she was looking into how data traffic evolves over time and that related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to a study released by telecoms lobbying group ETNO on Monday, Meta, Alphabet, Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Netflix accounted for over 56% of all global data traffic last year.

The study said an annual contribution of 20 billion euros ($21 billion) to network costs by the tech giants could give a 72-billion-euro boost to the EU economy. ETNO's members include Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) and Orange (ORAN.PA).

Vestager, however, gave short shrift to the telecoms industry's calls to loosen EU merger rules to allow more consolidation.

""The problem is that the arguments that we hear, like the need for scale in order to invest, they are not new,"" she said.

May 2 (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Donald Trump’s Truth Social app will launch on a web browser at the end of May, Chief Executive Devin Nunes said on Monday.

In a post on the platform, Nunes also said Truth Social has not yet been approved for launch in the Google Play store for Android devices.

""End of May we will launch PWA (Web Browser) this will allow access from any device,"" Nunes wrote. ""After that we will launch an Android App... pending approval from Google!”

Availability in the Google Play and Apple App stores is key to the app's ability to scale up.

Truth Social’s parent company, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), launched with the mission of standing up to Big Tech, after Trump was kicked off Twitter (TWTR.N), Facebook and YouTube for allegedly inciting or glorifying violence during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riots.

Yet the social media venture is limited by its reliance on Alphabet-owned Google (GOOGL.O) and Apple (AAPL.O), which operate app stores that dominate the smartphone market. read more

Truth Social launched in the Apple App store on Feb. 21 and was for a time the most downloaded free app there. It was number two on that list on Monday.

Lawsuit says Rivos working on integrated circuits like those running Apple laptops, phones















(Reuters) - Technology startup Rivos Inc allegedly stole Apple Inc's computer-chip trade secrets after poaching its engineers, Apple said in a lawsuit filed in California federal court.

Apple's Friday lawsuit said Mountain View, California-based Rivos has hired over 40 of its former employees in the past year to work on competing ""system-on-chip"" (SoC) technology, and that at least two former Apple engineers took gigabytes of confidential information with them to Rivos.

Rivos is a ""stealth"" startup that has largely avoided public attention since its founding last year. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Apple declined to comment on the lawsuit.

SoCs are integrated circuits that include several computer components in a single chip, including central processing units and graphic processing units.

Apple said it spent billions of dollars and more than a decade of research on its SoC designs, which have ""revolutionized the personal and mobile computing worlds.""

Apple said in the lawsuit that Rivos purposely sought to hire Apple engineers with access to the tech giant's SoC trade secrets. It named two former engineers, Bhasi Kaithamana and Ricky Wen, who allegedly took thousands of files with SoC designs and other confidential information to Rivos.

Kaithamana did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Wen could not be reached for comment.

The lawsuit also said several other unnamed Rivos employees took confidential documents when they left Apple, and that the defendants tried to cover their tracks by wiping data from their Apple-issued devices.

Apple said its secrets could be used to ""significantly accelerate"" the development of competing SoCs. It asked the court to block Rivos from using its trade secrets, order its former employees to return its property, and to award it an undisclosed amount of money damages.

The case is Apple Inc v. Rivos Inc, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 5:22-cv-02637.

BRUSSELS, May 2 (Reuters) - Apple faces a possible hefty fine and may have to open its mobile payment system to competitors after EU antitrust regulators charged the iPhone maker with restricting rivals' access to its technology used for mobile wallets.

This marks the second EU charge against Apple after EU regulators last year accused the company of distorting competition in the music streaming market following a complaint from Spotify (SPOT.N). read more

The European Commission said on Monday it had sent a charge sheet known as a statement of objections to Apple, detailing how the company had abused its dominant position in markets for mobile wallets on iOS devices.

The Commission said Apple's anti-competitive practices dated back to 2015 when Apple Pay was launched.

""We have indications that Apple restricted third-party access to key technology necessary to develop rival mobile wallet solutions on Apple's devices,"" EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.

""In our statement of objections, we preliminarily found that Apple may have restricted competition, to the benefit of its own solution Apple Pay,"" she said.

Apple, which could face a fine up to 10% of its global turnover or $36.6 billion based on its revenue last year, though EU penalties rarely reach the cap, said it would continue to engage with the Commission.

""Apple Pay is only one of many options available to European consumers for making payments, and has ensured equal access to NFC while setting industry-leading standards for privacy and security,"" the company said in a statement.

Apple's Frankfurt-listed shares fell on the news and were down 0.7% at 1216 GMT.

Apple Pay is used by more than 2,500 banks in Europe and over 250 fintechs and challenger banks. The NFC chip enables tap-and-go payments on iPhones and iPads.

Vestager rejected the company's security argument.

""Our investigation to date did not reveal any evidence that would point to such a higher security risk. On the contrary, evidence on our file indicates that Apple's conduct cannot be justified by security concerns,"" she told a news conference.

Apple can ask for a closed-door hearing to defend its case and also send a written response before the Commission issues a decision, which could take a year or more.

The EU is set to implement new tech rules next year called the Digital Markets Act which will force Apple to open up its closed eco-system or face fines as much as 10% of its global turnover.

The Commission's decision to send its statement of objections to Apple confirmed a Reuters story in October last year. read more

AMSTERDAM, May 3 (Reuters) - Universal Music Group (UMG.AS) (UMG) reported better than expected first quarter sales on Tuesday, driven by 20% growth in subscription and streaming revenue.

UMG, the largest of the big three record labels ahead of Warner (WMG.O) and Sony Music (6758.T), expects a continuation of the boom in music streaming that was led by Spotify (SPOT.N) and revived the industry's fortunes in the late 2010s.

A statement from CEO Lucian Grainge said the quarter was remarkable for UMG's strength across artists, geographical regions, and formats.

UMG represents stars and collects royalties for artists such as Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and Korean pop stars BTS.

""Top sellers for the quarter included releases from Disney’s ‘Encanto’ soundtrack, King & Prince, The Weeknd, Fujii Kaze and Ado,"" the company said.

First-quarter revenue rose 22% year on year, or 16.5% at constant currencies, to 2.2 billion euros ($2.3 billion), with streaming income up 25% and subscription income up 18.3%, offsetting falls in downloads.

Core profit, meanwhile, was in line with expectations, rising to 455 million euros from 396 million euros, as margins dipped slightly.

In addition to subscription revenue from Spotify and Apple Music (AAPL.O), UMG has struck revenue-sharing deals with ad-supported social media platforms such as TikTok and YouTube for their use of its artists' music, though terms are not public.

UMG was spun out of France's Vivendi (VIV.PA) last September in the largest European stock market listing of 2021, with shares initially surging from 18.50 euros to 25 euros. They have since retreated and are down about 9.5% in 2022, closing at 22.21 euros on Tuesday. read more

In March, the company declined to give a specific forecast for 2022, saying it would have a ""strong"" year that would be in line with a mid-term target of double-digit revenue growth. read more

Organizers at the Towson Mall store near Baltimore said they had signatures from more than 65% of employees who are likely to be eligible, according to the report.

The union intends to file paperwork with the National Labor Relations Board in the coming days, the Washington Post said.

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Workers at an Apple store in Atlanta in April filed a petition to hold a union election, seeking to become the company's first U.S. store to unionize amid a wave of labor activity at other major firms. read more

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) workers voted against unionizing a second warehouse in New York City, a ballot count on Monday showed, representing a defeat for labor organizers who just weeks ago secured their first U.S. win at the retailing giant. read more

AMSTERDAM, May 4 (Reuters) - The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) announced on Wednesday a preliminary investigation into Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google for possible anti-competitive practices in its Play store.

Tinder owner Match group (MTCH.O) had asked the regulator to assess whether Google is abusing a dominant position in the dating app market.

""Dating-app providers allegedly are no longer able to use a payment system other than Google's payment system,"" ACM spokesperson Murco Mijnlieff said in an email.

In a response, a Google spokesperson said the company charges customers 15% commissions for subscriptions via Google Play, which it said was ""the lowest rate among major app platforms.""

It said app distributors can also avoid Google Play entirely by distributing their apps via other stores or websites.

The Dutch ACM remains locked in a two-year fight with Google competitor Apple over alternative means of payment for dating apps on the App Store.

Apple has received 50 million euros in fines -- the maximum possible under a current court decision -- for failure to comply with an ACM order to make it possible for dating app developers to offer customers non-Apple payment methods. read more

On Monday the ACM said the most recent proposals by Apple to remedy the situation, on March 30, were still not sufficient and it is preparing a new order with new payment penalties.

""Once we have published this new order subject to periodic penalty payments, we can comment on the contents thereof as well as on the points on which Apple is still in non-compliance. That may take several weeks,"" the ACM said.

Apple has said it believes it has already sufficiently complied with the ACM's orders and declined further comment.

BERLIN, May 4 (Reuters) - EU antitrust rules should be beefed up to allow regulators to break up companies for serious breaches, German State Secretary Sven Giegold said on Wednesday, urging EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager to consider this when reforming regulations.

Rules known as Regulation 1/2003, in force since 2004, have allowed Vestager to go after Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta (FB.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Intel (INTC.O), and impose billions of euros in fines.

Vestager's proposal to reform the rules came as companies complained about lengthy proceedings and demands for information ranging from minutiae to complex data. read more

Giegold, state secretary at the German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, said Vestager should be bolder.

""Market investigations and structural remedies should also be on the table for the upcoming review of the regulation 1/2003 that Vice President Margaret Vestager has announced recently,"" he told a conference organised by the German cartel office.

Giegold said European Union merger rules could also do with an update to strengthen them, in particular against big companies acquiring smaller rivals to close them down.

""One particular area where we need reinforcement is EU merger control. The number of interventions in mergers has dropped over the years,"" he said.

""Unfortunately, and to some extent incomprehensibly the European mission so far has resisted calls to look into the EU merger regulation and the underlying substantive guidelines to better deal with killer acquisitions. We need reform here,"" Giegold said.

Giegold said the German government planned to give more powers to the country's cartel office.

""We will look into giving more flexibility to the Bundeskartellamt in this regard in regard with its market internal investigations when reforming our national competition law,"" he said.

PARIS, May 4 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc's (FB.O) chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, on Wednesday teased a new smart glasses project with EssilorLuxottica (ESLX.PA), posting a photo of the eyewear company's chairman sporting a prototype of a neural interface wristband - designed for directing other devices.

""Here Leonardo is using a prototype of our neural interface EMG [electromyography] wristband that will eventually let you control your glasses and other devices,"" Zuckerberg said in a post on Facebook, referring to EssilorLuxottica's chairman, Leonardo Del Vecchio. He closed his message with a smiley-face emoji wearing sunglasses.

Facebook - which changed its name to Meta Platforms in October - said in a blog post last year that it planned to develop a wristband that would control augmented reality glasses, allowing users to interact with a virtual world using finger movements.

Zuckerberg was in Milan to discuss plans for new smart glasses with the eyewear company, he said.

Tech companies Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google have piled in to the wearable tech business, developing augmented reality glasses in a bet they could one day replace mobile phones. Google also embraced fitness tracking technology by acquiring Fitbit for $2.1 billion.

In 2020, EssilorLuxottica and Meta Platforms announced a multiyear collaboration to develop smart glasses. They currently sell frames like the classic Ray-Ban Wayfarer model that are embedded with technology, allowing the wearer to take photos and listen to music and calls, starting at $299.

Summary Law firms Lerner has been lead counsel for tech companies in litigation

He joins WilmerHale as a San Francisco-based partner















(Reuters) - Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr said Thursday the large law firm has added technology litigator Joshua Lerner in San Francisco from Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.

Lerner, who was chair of Gibson Dunn's trade secrets practice group, advises tech companies in trade secret, class action and commercial litigation, the 1,000-lawyer firm said.

He has also handled patent, trademark and founder disputes, WilmerHale said.

Lerner joined Gibson Dunn in 2019 from California midsize law firm Durie Tangri, where he practiced after working in-house at biotechnology company Genentech Inc.

He has represented clients including Twitter Inc and Apple Inc, court records show.

A Gibson Dunn spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on his departure.

Washington, D.C.-based WilmerHale opened its San Francisco office in 2019, its third in California.

Law firms have flocked to Northern California in recent years, opening new offices with sights set on technology-related work.

In November, Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton lured WilmerHale antitrust lawyer Heather Nyong'o as part of its own Bay Area launch.

124,393,APPLE,2022-05-05,"'Fortnite' returns to iOS, Android devices via Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming","













May 5 (Reuters) - Users of Xbox Cloud Gaming will now be able to play ""Fortnite"" for free on devices powered by Google-owned Android and Apple's iOS thanks to a partnership between Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Epic Games, the companies said on Thursday.

The hit battle-royal videogame has been out of the reach of mobile users since Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Google removed it from their app stores in 2020 over a tussle about in-app payment guidelines.

The Microsoft partnership would allow users including PC gamers to stream ""Fortnite"" on internet browsers on their devices just like Netflix irrespective of the hardware specifications.

The move is likely to help Microsoft attract more casual gamers as the software giant doubles down on efforts to bolster its presence in the videogaming market and take on rival Sony Corp (6758.T). The company earlier this year unveiled a $68.7 billion takeover of ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O).

""Fortnite"" is the first free-to-play title to join the Xbox Cloud Gaming service. ""It's an important step to add a Free-to-Play title to the cloud gaming catalog as we continue our cloud journey,"" Microsoft said in a blog post.

Since launching in 2020, more than 10 million people around the world have streamed games through Xbox Cloud Gaming. The service is available in 26 markets, including the United States.

Microsoft, as well as Epic Games and scores of other firms, have criticized Apple's store practices, which require developers to pay commissions of up to 30% for purchases made in the store.

The ""Fortnite"" creator has also been involved in a legal battle with Apple, but it largely lost a trial last year over whether Apple's payment rules for apps were anticompetitive.

That decision found Apple had suitable reasons to force some app makers to use its payment system and take commissions of 15% to 30% on their sales.

REUTERS/Leah Millis/POOL















ATLANTA, May 5 (Reuters) - U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts on Thursday decried as ""absolutely appalling"" the leak of a draft decision indicating the Supreme Court is poised to overturn the constitutional right to abortion in his first public appearance since its disclosure on Monday.

The leak prompted an internal crisis at the nation's top judicial body and ignited a political firestorm, with abortion rights supporters staging rallies outside the courthouse and at various locations around the United States.

""A leak of this stature is absolutely appalling,"" Roberts told a judicial conference in Atlanta.

""If the person behind it thinks that it will affect our work, that's just foolish,"" Roberts added.

The chief justice the day after the draft was published announced an investigation into the source of the unprecedented leak that he called a betrayal of the confidentiality of the judicial process.

Roberts addressed the matter briefly on Thursday at the conference after another participant, Judge Ed Carnes of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, asked him about the ""elephant in the room."" Roberts praised the Supreme Court's workforce, from the clerks serving the nine justices all the way to the employees who empty waste baskets at night.

""I'd hate for one bad apple change the perception of that,"" Roberts said.

The draft opinion, authored by conservative Justice Samuel Alito and published by the Politico news outlet, would uphold a Mississippi law banning abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy and overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide.

The court confirmed the authenticity of the document but called it preliminary. The court is due to issue its ruling in the case by the end of June.

Roberts spoke at the 11th Circuit Judicial Conference, a gathering of lawyers and judges from the Atlanta-based federal appeals court and the federal district courts of Georgia, Florida and Alabama. Conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, a native of Georgia, was scheduled to appear at the conference on Friday.

BERLIN, May 5 (Reuters) - Europe's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, the architect of landmark rules to curb the power of U.S. tech giants, called on Thursday for a global approach towards Big Tech to prevent companies taking advantage of enforcement gaps.

Vestager, who has handed out billions of euros in fines to Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google and launched investigations into Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Meta Platform's (FB.O) Facebook, said there was global agreement on the issues raised by large digital platforms.

""This debate is no longer a hot topic amongst competition practitioners but it has strong political attention,"" she told a conference organised by the German Cartel Office.

Vestager urged antitrust watchdogs around the world to work together to tackle the issue.

""Close cooperation will be necessary because we will not be short of work and we will not be short of novel services or practices to look at,"" she said.

""It goes without saying that the more we, as an international competition community, are able to harmonise our approach, the less opportunity there will be for global tech giants to exploit enforcement gaps between our jurisdictions,"" Vestager said.

U.S. antitrust enforcers and some U.S. states are also investigating Google, Facebook and Apple. Big Tech is also under fire in South Korea, India and Australia.

127,883,APPLE,2022-05-06,Russia publishes list of 'parallel imports' goods,"













May 6 (Reuters) - Russia published a detailed list of goods from foreign carmakers, technology companies and consumer brands on Friday that the government has included in a so-called ""parallel imports"" scheme aimed at shielding consumers from business isolation by the West.

Many global brands have halted sales in Russia in response to Moscow sending tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, while unprecedented Western sanctions have limited access to already strained global supply chains.

The government had announced in March it would allow the ""parallel imports"" system. read more

The mechanism allows a Russian company to buy goods from any company outside Russia, including from the country of the goods' origin, that earlier purchased those goods legally, a source at the Russian trade ministry said on Friday, explaining the scheme.

The government list published in a document on Friday includes goods from all major foreign carmakers, technology companies such as Apple (AAPL.O) and Cisco (CSCO.O), and a long list of fashion brands.

The document named the trademark holders to whom it said certain copyright provisions no longer apply. The list of goods ranged from car parts and construction materials to cosmetics, electrical equipment and textiles.

""Parallel import does not mean permission to import and circulate counterfeit goods in Russia - the products must be legally put into circulation from the country of import,"" the trade ministry said in a statement.

""One of the principles of compiling the list was defending the interests of domestic consumers for products of those foreign companies that left the Russian market under the sanctions regime imposed by 'unfriendly' countries,"" it said.

Parallel imports should not be seen as equal to grey imports as customs services will be paid and the shipments will be legal from Russia's point of view, said Dmitry Polevoy, head of investment at LockoInvest asset management and former chief economist at the state-run Russian Direct Investment Fund.

""The volume of imports will likely be lower than before the latest sanctions, as issues with logistics need resolving,"" said Polevoy, adding that producers could impose restrictions to comply with sanctions and extra costs incurred would likely push prices up.

""The question is to what extent producers will be closing their eyes to the fact that their products will go to Russia.""

May 11 (Reuters) - Bumble Inc (BMBL.O) beat first-quarter profit and revenue estimates on Wednesday, helped by a rise in paying members crowding its dating apps to seek connection, sending the company's shares up 11% in after-hours trading.

The resurgence in COVID-19 cases has helped dating apps to keep users picked up during the pandemic, as people stuck at home sought virtual social interaction.

Data from research firm Apptopia showed that Bumble downloads in the United States increased 20.6% during the first quarter, while monthly average users rose 13.7%, compared to a year earlier.

""Bumble App drove substantial revenue growth across the U.S. and international markets and delivered a significant sequential increase in paying users,"" Chief Executive Officer Whitney Wolfe Herd said in a statement.

The owner of the dating app that requires women to make the first move said total paying users increased by 7.2% to 3 million during the quarter, which helped boost revenue to $211.2 million, above analysts' estimates of $208.30 million.

For the current quarter, Bumble forecast revenue between $218 million to $221 million, which includes an unfavorable impact from the Ukraine conflict of $6 million, primarily in Badoo App. Analysts are expecting $224.16 million.

Earlier in March, Bumble said it was discontinuing operations in Russia, that included the removal of all of its apps from Apple App Store and Google Play Store in Russia and Belarus. read more

Bumble said it lost 60,000 paying users between the fourth and first quarter in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus and it expects a decline of about 120,000 to 130,000 paying users across these three markets in the current quarter.

Excluding items, Bumble earned 13 cents per share for the first quarter. Analysts on average had expected the company to report a loss of 3 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Shares of the Austin, Texas-based company rose to $11.4% to $19.64 in extended trading.

Court rejected bid for new trial in 8-year-old case















(Reuters) - The University of Wisconsin's patent-licensing arm lost a bid Tuesday for a new trial against Apple Inc after the U.S. Supreme Court wiped out an earlier $506 million award it won against the iPhone maker.

A Madison, Wisconsin federal court rejected a request by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation to reopen the case based on a new theory of how Apple allegedly infringed a computer-processing patent. The court on Tuesday issued a final judgment for Apple.

WARF, Apple and their attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

WARF sued Apple in 2014, arguing that chips used in iPhones and iPads violated its rights in technology for improving processor performance.

A Wisconsin jury awarded WARF $234 million in 2015, and U.S. District Judge William Conley increased the award to over $506 million with additional damages in 2017.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit overturned the verdict in 2018 and said no reasonable juror could have found that Apple's chips infringed. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected WARF's request to review the decision in 2019.

WARF requested a new trial in Wisconsin later that year, arguing it should be allowed to present a new theory based on the Federal Circuit's new interpretation of its patent. The foundation said Apple's chips infringed by using the equivalent of its technology, even though it did not match the exact wording of its patent.

Conley rejected WARF's request Tuesday because the foundation had dropped the theory by choice before trial, and its decision to abandon the theory was unrelated to either court's interpretation of the patent.

The case is Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation v. Apple Inc, U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, No. 3:14-cv-00062.

Indexes: Dow down 1%, S&P 500 down 1.7%, Nasdaq down 3.2%















NEW YORK, May 11 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended sharply lower on Wednesday, with the Nasdaq dropping more than 3% and the Dow falling for a fifth straight day after U.S. inflation data did little to ease investor worries over the outlook for interest rates and the economy.

The benchmark S&P 500 lost 1.7% and is now down 18% from its Jan. 3 record closing high.

The Labor Department's monthly consumer price index (CPI) report suggested inflation may have peaked in April but is likely to stay strong enough to keep the Federal Reserve's foot on the brakes to cool demand. read more

The CPI increased 0.3% last month, the smallest gain since last August, while economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer prices gaining 0.2% in April.

""It did not dispel the notion that there's more to go in terms of reining in inflation,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.

""The market is trying to make sense of whether we're also going to see growth pullback more than expected"" as the Fed raises rates, she said.

Apple (AAPL.O) shares dropped 5.2% and were the biggest weight on the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes.

""There is much focus right now on Apple,"" Krosby said. ""Given its weighting, Apple is the bellwether for the market from many perspectives.""

Investor concerns about whether the Fed will continue to hike interest rates aggressively have hit growth stocks especially hard. The consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) and technology (.SPLRCT)sectors fell about 3% each, leading S&P 500 sector declines.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 326.63 points, or 1.02%, to 31,834.11, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 65.87 points, or 1.65%, to 3,935.18 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 373.44 points, or 3.18%, to 11,364.24.

The Dow's five-day decline was its longest losing streak since mid-February.

Energy (.SPNY) shares ended higher and helped to limit some of the declines in the S&P 500 and Dow. Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) shares were up 2.1%.

Value outperformed growth shares in general. The S&P growth index (.IGX) was down 2.8% on the day versus a 0.5% decline in the S&P value index (.IVX).

Investors are anxious to see more data on inflation Thursday, when U.S. producer price index data is due.

Stocks have fallen this year following the rate concerns, as well as the Ukraine war and the latest coronavirus lockdowns in China.

Google/Handout via REUTERS















May 11 (Reuters) - The science-fiction is harder to see in Google's second try at glasses with a built-in computer.

A decade after the debut of Google Glass, a nubby, sci-fi-looking pair of specs that filmed what wearers saw but raised concerns about privacy and received low marks for design, the Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) unit on Wednesday previewed a yet-unnamed pair of standard-looking glasses that display translations of conversations in real time and showed no hint of a camera.

The new augmented-reality pair of glasses was just one of several longer-term products Google unveiled at its annual Google I/O developer conference aimed at bridging the real world and the company's digital universe of search, Maps and other services using the latest advances in artificial intelligence.

""What we're working on is technology that enables us to break down language barriers, taking years of research in Google Translate and bringing that to glasses,"" said Eddie Chung, a director of product management at Google, calling the capability ""subtitles for the world.""

Selling more hardware could help Google increase profit by keeping users in its network of technology, where it does not have to split ad sales with device makers such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O)and Samsung Electronics CO (005930.KS)that help distribute its services.

Google also teased a tablet to be launched in 2023 and a smartwatch that will go on sale late this year, as it unveils a strategy to offer a group of products comparable to Apple.

But Google's hardware business remains small, with its global market share in smartphones, for instance, under 1%, according to researcher IDC. Recently launched challengers in search along with ongoing antitrust investigations across the world into Google's dominance in mobile software and other areas threaten to limit the company's ability to gain steam in new ventures.

Alphabet shares fell 0.7% on Wednesday.

The reveal of the new glasses reflect the company's growing caution amid greater scrutiny on Big Tech. When Google Glass was demonstrated at I/O in 2012, skydivers used it to live stream a jump onto a San Francisco building, with the company getting special air clearance for the stunt.

This time around, Google showed only a video of its prototype, which displayed translations for conversations involving English, Mandarin, Spanish and American Sign Language.

It did not specify a release date or immediately confirm that the device lacked a camera.

Separate to the gadget, Google earlier demonstrated a feature that eventually would let users take video of store shelves with wine bottles and ask the search app to perform functions like automatically identify options from Black-owned wineries.

Similarly, users later this year will be able to snap a photo of a product and locate nearby stores where it is available.

Also later this year, Maps will launch an immersive view for some big cities that fuses Street View and aerial images ""to create a rich, digital model of the world,"" Google said.

NEW HARDWARE

The tablet reverses Google's decision three years ago to abandon making its own after poor sales. It shipped just 500,000 of those units, according to IDC.

The new tablet follows increased user interest and was announced early to inform buyers considering alternatives, Rick Osterloh, Google senior vice president for devices and services, told reporters.

He added that the Pixel Watch, which will not be compatible with Apple's iPhones, will attract different users than devices from Google's Fitbit, which is associated with health and fitness and was acquired last year for $2.1 billion.

Among other announcements, a relaunched Google Wallet app will virtually store drivers licenses in some areas of the United States later this year, mirroring a feature Apple debuted for Arizona on its iPhones in March.

133,514,APPLE,2022-05-12,Abu Dhabi leads major Gulf bourses lower on recession fears,"













May 12 (Reuters) - Major Gulf bourses tumbled in early trade on Thursday, as data showed U.S. inflation persistently hot, deepening investor worries about the economic toll of aggressive interest rate hikes.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) fell 2.3% to a 22-month low. Japan's Nikkei (.N225) fell 1.8%.

In Abu Dhabi, the index (.FTFADGI) slid 4.9%, its biggest intraday fall since March 2020, dragged down by a near 8% fall in the United Arab Emirates' largest lender First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB.AD).

Saudi Arabia's benchmark index (.TASI) declined 2%, with Al Rajhi Bank (1120.SE) bank losing 2.4% and oil giant Saudi Aramco (2222.SE) retreated 3.1% to 44.1 riyals, pulling back from the top spot as the world's most valued company.

On Wednesday, Aramco dethroned Apple Inc (AAPL.O) as the biggest company by market capitalization after the latter fell more than 5%.

Aramco is now worth about $2.35 trillion easing from $2.43 trillion, compared to $2.37 trillion valuation of Apple, Refinitiv data shows.

Dubai's main share index (.DFMGI) tumbled 4.6%, as shares fell across the board, including sharia-compliant lender Dubai Islamic Bank (DISB.DU), which plunged 7.5%.

Oil prices dropped more than 1% in a volatile week as economic concerns and recession fears dogged global financial markets, outweighing supply concerns and geopolitical tensions in Europe.

Oil prices are under pressure this week, along with global financial markets, on jitters over rising interest rates, the strongest U.S. dollar in two decades, concerns over inflation and possible recession. Prolonged COVID-19 lockdowns in world's top crude importer China have also impacted the market.

The Qatari index (.QSI) dropped 1.2%, with petrochemical maker Industries Qatar (IQCD.QA) falling 3.8%.

May 12 (Reuters) - A Moscow law firm that has filed cases against Apple and Netflix over what it says are consumer rights violations is aiming to ""punish"" other Western companies that have quit Russia, its senior partner told Reuters.

A lot of mainly Western companies have said they will pause or halt operations in Russia since President Vladimir Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Netflix (NFLX.O) stopped all future projects and acquisitions in Russia in March and suspended its streaming service. read more Apple (AAPL.O) restricted the use of its Apple Pay service and stopped all exports into its Russia sales channels.

The law firm, Chernyshov, Lukoyanov & Partners, filed two class action lawsuits in April, seeking 60 million roubles ($948,617) in moral damages for Netflix users and 90 million roubles from Apple for reducing its devices' functionality and value. Those figures could rise as more people join. read more

Netflix and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Konstantin Lukoyanov, senior partner with Chernyshov, Lukoyanov & Partners that has invited aggrieved Russians to come forward with complaints against exiting companies, said the number of potential claims had surprised him.

""We have only now realised how many consumers feel their rights have been violated,"" Lukoyanov said in an interview. ""Every day we are getting calls with some new story.

""At the start of our journey, we thought there would be three, four or five big companies, but in fact there are many more,"" he said, declining to give specific names.

Lukoyanov said the goal of his firm's lawsuits was twofold - to establish precedents in Russia's nascent tradition of class action suits and to ""seriously punish"" companies that leave.

He expects Russia's judicial system to rule in favour of Russian consumers, but acknowledged that people may only hope to see compensation should companies choose to come back some day.

""We are counting on companies being compelled to return to the Russian market and then having to close any claims that accumulated before they left,"" he said.

Asked how genuine the lawsuits were, Lukoyanov said his firm was treating each case very carefully and seriously, and that if American users were cut off from Apple Pay, no one would be surprised by a class action suit.

""I would not be sceptical about this whole story. It is quite serious. There are no jokes here.""

135,288,APPLE,2022-05-12,"Apple supplier Foxconn sees challenges ahead in China COVID curbs, inflation","Summary

Summary Companies Q1 net profit T$29.45 bln vs T$29.76 bln market view

Sees flat Q2 and 2022 revenue

Sees flat revenue from consumer electronics business in 2022















TAIPEI, May 12 (Reuters) - Apple supplier Foxconn (2317.TW) warned that current-quarter revenue for its electronics business including smartphones could slip as growth slowed amid rising inflation, cooling demand and escalating supply chain issues partly due to lockdowns in China.

The Taiwanese firm, the world's largest contract electronics maker, has grappled with a severe shortage of chips like other global manufacturers, which has hurt smartphone production including for its major client Apple (AAPL.O). read more

While the company reiterated that COVID-19 controls in China only had a limited impact on its production as it kept workers on-site in a ""closed loop"" system, demand for its products in the country has suffered as people remain shut in. The slowdown has recently been exacerbated with a downturn in major markets due to high inflation and the war in Ukraine.

The predictions reinforce the urgency for Foxconn to reduce its reliance on smartphones and consumer electronics, which make up slightly more than half of its total revenue, and diversify into areas such as electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing which it sees as a $34 billion business by 2025.

""There are many uncertainties in the market at the moment,"" Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way told a post-earnings call, citing the pandemic, geopolitical risks and inflation among them for the year.

""They are presenting quite some challenges to demand and supply,"" Liu said.

The slight decline estimated in consumer electronics revenue for the second quarter was due to a higher base last year and before new product launches later this year, he said.

Liu said inflation is hitting demand for lower-end consumer electronics but the impact on the company so far has been limited as most of its products are higher end.

""We are closely watching when inflation will impact mid and high end products,"" he said.

The company, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, expects overall revenue to be flat for the current quarter and for the full year. It did not provide a numerical outlook, but projected strong growth for its other businesses such as components, computing products and cloud and networking products.

In the first quarter ended in March, Foxconn's revenue rose 4%. Net profit grew 5% to T$29.45 billion ($985.48 million) and was largely in line with an average analyst estimate of T$29.76 billion, according to Refinitiv.

In autos, Foxconn said it will develop new vehicles with struggling U.S. EV maker Lordstown Motors Corp (RIDE.O). On Wednesday, the Taiwan company said it completed a deal to buy a factory in Ohio from Lordstown for $230 million.

The two companies will also form a joint venture to make vehicles, with Lordstown owning a 45% stake and Foxconn owning the rest. read more

Liu said gross profit margins for assembling EVs are relatively low, similar to its smartphone assembly business. That is why Foxconn plans to develop more profitable EV components such as auto chips and batteries, he said.

""Only in this way can we achieve double-digit gross profit margins.""

Foxconn shares closed 1% lower ahead of the earnings release, versus a 2.4% drop in the broader market (.TWII). They have fallen about 2% so far this year, giving the company a market value of $48.1 billion.

May 12 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi led Middle East stock markets lower on Thursday as fears grew that fast-rising inflation will drive a sharp rise in interest rates that brings the global economy to a standstill.

The U.S. Labor Department's monthly consumer price index (CPI) report suggested inflation may have peaked in April but is likely to stay strong enough to keep the Federal Reserve's foot on the brakes to cool demand. read more

In Abu Dhabi, the index (.FTFADGI) tumbled 5.8%, its biggest intraday fall since March 2020, dragged down by a 8.5% plunge in the United Arab Emirates' largest lender First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB.AD).

The main share index (.DFMGI) in Dubai, the Middle East's business and tourism hub, dived 5.7%, with blue-chip developer Emaar Properties (EMAR.DU) tumbling 8%.

Oil prices, a key catalyst for the Gulf's financial markets, fell in a volatile week as recession fears dogged global financial markets, outweighing supply concerns and geopolitical tensions in Europe.

Saudi Arabia's benchmark index (.TASI) slid 4.1%, with Al Rajhi Bank (1120.SE) declining 6.5%.

Among other stocks that fell, oil behemoth Saudi Aramco (2222.SE) retreated 1.8% to 44.70 riyals.

Aramco had dethroned Apple Inc (AAPL.O) as the biggest company by market capitalization after the latter fell more than 5% in the previous session.

Aramco is now worth about $2.38 trillion easing from $2.43 trillion, still higher compared to $2.37 trillion valuation of Apple, Refinitiv data shows.

Outside the Gulf, Egypt's blue-chip index (.EGX30) fell 1.6%, as almost all the stocks on the index were in negative territory.

The Egyptian market remains exposed to the changing sentiment and could continue seeing a volatile performance, said Fadi Reyad, market analyst at CAPEX.com.

""The change in expectations comes on top of the impact the country is witnessing from the conflict in Ukraine.""

Tensions were stoked again as Finland confirmed it would apply to join NATO ""without delay"" in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a war that has already had a major economic effect by driving up global energy and food prices. read more

Summary Related documents Objectors challenged the $310 mln ""megafund"" settlement and lawyers' fees

On appeal, class attorneys and Apple counsel defend judge who approved settlement















(Reuters) - A national plaintiffs' firm on Wednesday asked a U.S. appeals court in California to uphold a nearly $80 million legal-fee award that was part of a $310 million settlement resolving class claims over the performance of certain Apple Inc iPhones.

In the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Mark Molumphy of Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy spurned objectors' allegations that the attorneys' fee award, which was 26% of the settlement, was too high, depriving the class of tens of millions of dollars, and other claims over the settlement notice process.

U.S. District Judge Edward Davila in San Jose, California, held two days of hearings and ""did not rubber-stamp the settlement,"" Molumphy told Circuit Judges Jacqueline Nguyen, Ryan Nelson and John Owens. Davila weighed objections to the compensation award and to the settlement, one of the largest class resolutions in California, before approving them in March 2021, Molumphy said.

The panel raised concerns at the hour-long argument about whether Davila used the wrong legal frame before approving the settlement. Nguyen questioned whether Davila wrongly approached reviewing the settlement under a ""presumption"" that it was reasonable.

Nelson said to Molumphy: ""It doesn't look to me like the district court engaged to the degree that we might expect the court to do on the substance of some of the arguments that were raised.""

Molumphy on Thursday declined to comment.

The settlement resolved multidistrict claims that Apple secretly diminished the performance of certain iPhone operating systems in order to minimize phones from shutting off unexpectedly.

In settling the case, Apple said it had ""agreed to put this matter behind it"" but stood by what it called a performance management feature that ""solved a complex technological problem.""

Apple's lawyer in the appeal, Chris Chorba, co-chair of Gibson Dunn's class actions practice group, deferred comment to Apple. A company representative did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

""What does the panel want Judge Davila to do that he did not do?"" Chorba said in court, defending the settlement.

""Maybe set up-front the standard that he's actually applying,"" Nelson replied.

The appeals court heard arguments from objectors including Ted Frank, director of the Hamilton Lincoln Law Institute for Class Action Fairness.

His brief in the appeal argued that the percentage should not be greater than about 17%, which would return more than $35 million to the consumer class.

The case is In re Apple Inc Device Performance Litigation, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-15758.

Summary Companies Digitalisation of several industries underpin growth

Ambitions operating margin of 30% by 2027 at latest

Shares up















PARIS, May 12 (Reuters) - Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics said itis hoping for over $20 billion in annual sales by 2027 at the latest, sending its shares higher as investors welcomed the prospect of prolonged growth underpinned by the digitalisation of the economy.

STMicro's mid-term sales target represents about a 30% increase from the top range of its expectations for this year, at $15.3 billion.

The semi-conductor industry is running at full steam to the point that it recently hit bottlenecks that affected the output of major carmakers.

STMicro said that it was ramping up its production to meet soaring demand for chips and sensors that can now be found in increased number in smartphones, cars and a growing number of connected devices.

The electrification of the car industry, new mobile networks and a boom in cloud services are beefing up orders for the group's chips, it said.

Chief Executive Officer Jean-Marc Chery said he expected sales of silicon carbide chips, aimed at improving the charging capacity of batteries in electric vehicles and the time between charges, to reach $1 billion in 2023, one year earlier than previously expected.

STMicro's shares were up by about 2% at 1000 GMT, topping France's blue-chip index CAC 40 (.FCHI).

The stock is down by 22% so far this year, as the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine fuelled market concerns about a sustained disruptions for the industry and an inflation of commodity and energy prices.

STMicro also hopes to to generate an operating margin of over 30% by 2027 at the latest.

The new guidance covers the 2025 to 2027 period, which means STMicro estimates it could reach the new sales and profit targets earlier, depending on market conditions.

The Geneva-based company, whose biggest clients include iPhone maker Apple (AAPL.O) and electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA.O), set the new financial forecast just before the start of its capital markets day held in Paris.

139,756,APPLE,2022-05-13,Global brands set too much store in China recovery,"













LONDON, May 13 (Reuters Breakingviews) - China’s Covid-19 “new normal” will challenge Western multinationals’ hopes for a quick rebound in the world’s second largest economy. Big groups from Apple (AAPL.O) to General Electric (GE.N) suffered a hit to revenue in the first quarter as renewed lockdowns paralysed factories and distribution networks and dented retail sales. Many companies are downplaying the impact as temporary. That’s overly optimistic.

Estée Lauder (EL.N) Chief Financial Officer Tracey Travis is probably not alone in making a bold call that China could reopen domestically in mid-May, and that pent-up demand would help it recover recent lost sales. The American cosmetics group’s revenue in Asia declined for the first time in two years in the three months to March. That was mainly due to China, where the company generates 36% of total sales, Jefferies analysts estimate. Remy Cointreau (RCOP.PA) insists its growth potential for the year remains unchanged, even though the French premium liquor maker’s revenue fell in the quarter ended in March, driven by a double-digit percentage drop in China.

The thinking is based on past experience. Foreign firms in China benefitted from the country’s rapid recovery from the pandemic’s early wave. Authorities also minimised economic damage by adopting targeted restrictions, especially in the key production and logistics hub of Shanghai. Both the American and European Chambers of Commerce in China said most of their member firms remained profitable in 2020 and 2021.

But the Omicron outbreak that crippled Shanghai in March triggered a profound change in Beijing’s approach. Authorities have introduced regular mass testing in nearly a dozen of the country’s top cities by GDP, even if no new cases are reported. Residents have to show a negative test result as frequently as every two days to enter public venues. Cheap testing kits will enable more cities to adopt the same approach.

In theory, this pre-empts another Shanghai-style flare-up read more . But it also makes reopening much tougher. The harsh treatment of those who catch the virus may discourage people from travelling and spending.

China’s 400 million middle-class consumers make the country a key growth market for companies like Italian luxury goods maker Salvatore Ferragamo (SFER.MI), which on Tuesday said it expects its sales to double in four to five years from 2021. One option is to expand online sales and invest more in marketing, but even then Covid-19 restrictions may interfere with deliveries. The alternative is to cultivate new consumers in other countries. For now, however, companies are setting too much store in China’s rapid recovery.

Brent crude prices ended the first quarter up almost 70% to $107.91 a barrel from end of March 2021, as the Russian invasion of Ukraine exacerbated concerns over petroleum supplies.

In Qatar, the index (.QSI) fell 0.5%, stretching losses for a third session, hit by a 4.5% slide in Commercial Bank (COMB.QA).

Most Gulf stock markets lost ground last week, reflecting investors' anxiety about fast-rising inflation that will drive a sharp rise in interest rates and put global economy growth at risk.

143,239,APPLE,2022-05-17,Apple sued after loud Amber Alert on AirPods said to damage Texas boy's hearing,"Summary Lawsuit says 12-year-old suffered ruptured eardrum from alert

Family says wireless earbuds defectively designed, claim fraud, negligence















(Reuters) - Apple Inc has been sued by the family of a Texas child who allegedly suffered permanent hearing loss from an Amber Alert on the company's AirPod wireless earbuds.

In the lawsuit filed Monday in San Jose, California, federal court, parents Carlos Gordoa and Ariani Reyes and their son, identified as B.G., said the AirPods were defective because they play alerts at dangerous volume, regardless of the volume set by the user. They accused the company of gross negligence and fraud.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

According to the lawsuit, the injury happened in May 2020, while B.G., then 12, was watching Netflix on his iPhone while wearing an AirPod connected to the phone in his right ear.

The family says an Amber Alert, which notifies users about missing and abducted children, abruptly produced an ""ear shattering"" sound level that ruptured B.G.'s eardrum and damaged his inner ear. As a result, B.G. has permanent hearing loss and tinnitus, suffers from dizziness and needs to wear a hearing aid, according to the lawsuit.

The family said Apple was aware that its AirPods played extremely loud alerts from online complaints going back to 2019 from users who noted that AirPods did not adjust the alert volume to match that of the media they were playing.

""This boy's life has been severely altered because Apple did not provide a warning about the volume levels of its AirPods, leading to his permanent hearing loss,"" Tej Paranjpe of PMR Law, a lawyer for the family, said in a statement.

The case is Gordoa v. Apple Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 3:22-cv-02900.

Apple told the court last year that it was entitled to a new damages trial or a ruling wiping out Optis' damages entirely. U.S. District Judge Rodney Gilstrap denied both of Apple's requests Tuesday, according to a notice of a sealed ruling.

The companies and their attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Plano, Texas-based Optis and its affiliates PanOptis Patent Management LLC and Unwired Planet LLC sued Apple in 2019, alleging its 4G LTE-capable products including iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches infringed its patents.

The Optis patents are essential to the international LTE wireless standard. Gilstrap tossed a $506 million verdict for Optis last April because the jury had not heard evidence about Optis' duty to offer licenses to the patents on fair terms.

Gilstrap ordered a new trial on damages, but upheld the finding that Apple infringed. A new jury awarded Optis $300 million in August after the second trial.

Apple asked Gilstrap to throw out the award in October. The tech giant cited several alleged problems with the second trial, including issues with evidence, expert testimony, jury instructions and the amount of money Optis demanded.

The case is Optis Wireless Technology LLC v. Apple Inc, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, No. 2:19-cv-00066.

Some migrant workers looking to leave Shanghai

Goldman cuts China GDP forecast, warns of further slip

E-commerce giant JD.com says consumers losing confidence















SHANGHAI/BEIJING, May 18 (Reuters) - Health authorities in Shanghai faced ""huge"" pressure to keep China's most populous city free of COVID-19 as residents were counting down the days until June 1 when their lockdown is set to end after almost two months of isolation.

The commercial hub of 25 million achieved a fourth consecutive day without any new infections in the community, holding on to its prized ""zero COVID"" status and keeping alive hopes for an imminent end to lockdown misery.

Despite no new cases, authorities are not lifting the lockdown immediately, instead gradually easing restrictions until the start of next month, with some shops allowed to open this week and public transport expected to partly resume over the weekend.

Residents at housing compounds across Shanghai have been given passes that allow one person from each household to go out for a few hours at a time. Some can go out only twice a week and only within a few streets of their home.

To get into a supermarket, they also need a pass from the shop.

""The risk of finding positive infections among risk groups still exists and the pressure of ... preventing a rebound remains huge,"" Zhao Dandan of the municipal health commission told reporters on Wednesday.

The government of Shanghai's Xuhui district posted pictures on its social media account of workers planting flowers alongside largely deserted streets to ensure a ""clean and beautiful"" environment for the ""resumption of work and production in the city"".

But piles of trash spilled onto the roads in the central Changning district, and photos posted online showed weeds blanketing steps outside Apple and Versace stores in a once-busy shopping district, signs of how the city has struggled to maintain services during the lockdown.

Reuters could not immediately verify the photos.

As part of the gradual reopening, Shanghai authorities issued a list of 864 financial institutions that can resume work, three people with knowledge of the matter said. read more

Social media posts have shown long queues of people, mostly migrant workers, outside one of the city's main railway stations, looking to return home after getting permission to go outside.

Some have been photographed hauling suitcases on rented bikes or making long walks from distant corners of the city.

The United States, Europe and other regions have lifted restrictions to ""live with the virus"" and get their economies going even as infections spread, betting that high vaccination rates will keep their populations protected.

But China has chosen a radically different path, ruthlessly restricting movement and isolating people to end any outbreak, no matter the economic cost.

Defeating the highly transmissible Omicron variant has proven an uphill battle, as the struggle in the capital, Beijing, over the past month has shown.

Overall, Shanghai reported fewer than 1,000 new cases for May 17, none from outside quarantined areas. Beijing reported 69 cases, up from 52.

The capital has been discovering dozens of new cases almost every day since April 22.

While most Beijing residents are working from home, they can at least wander about outside, albeit with few places to go, as many shops, gyms and other businesses have closed.

""I'm happy that we are not confined at home like in Shanghai but still pretty frustrated at what's happening, as most of the countries have already moved on from COVID,"" said Lin Cong, 27, who lives in Beijing's Chaoyang district.

LOSING INCOME AND CONFIDENCE

China's uncompromising strategy to fight COVID has placed hundreds of millions of people in dozens of cities under restrictions of some kind and disrupted a global rebound in production of everything from mobile phones to electric vehicles.

Companies from Apple (AAPL.O) to Tesla (TSLA.O) have taken a hit.

E-commerce giant JD.com (9618.HK) said on Tuesday it was cautious about its outlook, because consumers were losing income and confidence and logistics have been disrupted. read more

This week, data showed Chinese consumption and factory output falling in April at a pace unseen since early 2020, as COVID, first detected in Wuhan city in late 2019, was beginning its global spread.

Meanwhile, new-home prices fell last month for the first time since December.

Goldman Sachs on Wednesday cut its 2022 economic growth forecast for China to 4% from 4.5%, well below the government's official target of around 5.5%, and warned it could slip further.

""This lower growth projection embeds the assumption that COVID is mostly under control going forward, the property market improves from here, and the government provides substantial policy offset"" the bank's analysts said in a note.

""While risks to our central forecast are two-sided, the tail may be fatter on the downside.""

May 19 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower after a volatile session on Thursday, with Cisco Systems slumping after giving a dismal outlook, while investors fretted about inflation and rising interest rates.

Shares of Cisco (CSCO.O) slumped 13.7% after the networking gear maker lowered its 2022 revenue growth outlook, taking a hit from its Russia exit and component shortages related to COVID-19 lockdowns in China. read more

Apple (AAPL.O) and chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O) declined 2.5% and 4.3%, respectively, and weighed on the S&P 500.

""The reality is that inflation is running hot and interest rates are rising,"" said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, Minnesota. ""Until you get that inflation rate to start slowing, we're going to have increased volatility, and in our view that continues through throughout most of the summer months.""

Its shares, however, rebounded over 4% after slumping 11% in the previous session due to dismal results from Target Corp (TGT.N).

The S&P 500 is down about 18% from its record close on Jan. 3 as investors adjust to strong inflation, geopolitical uncertainty stemming from the war in Ukraine and tightening financial conditions with the U.S. Federal Reserve raising rates.

A close of 20% or more below its January record high would confirm the S&P 500 has been in a bear market since hitting that peak, according to a widely used definition.

147,560,APPLE,2022-05-19,Taiwan April export orders seen growing for 26th month on robust demand,"Summary

Summary Companies reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=cpurl://apps.cp./Apps/econ-polls?RIC=TWEXOR%3DECI

Orders median forecast +8.3% y/y (prior month +16.8%)

Data due Friday, May 20, 4:00 p.m. (0800 GMT)















TAIPEI, May 19 (Reuters) - Taiwan's export orders likely rose in April for the 26th straight month, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday, supported by the pandemic-led demand for technology products, although global economic woes pulled down the pace of export growth.

The median forecast from a poll of 15 economists expects export orders to rise 8.3% from a year ago. Forecasts for growth ranged from 3.8% to as high as 14.4%.

The island's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, rose 16.8% to $62.69 billion in March year-on-year, outperforming expectations and the highest figure for the month on record.

However, the government has predicted April orders will only grow between 1% and 3.8%, compared with the year-ago period, due to the Ukraine conflict and global supply bottlenecks.

Taiwan's export orders are a leading indicator of demand for hi-tech gadgets and Asian exports, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months.

The island's manufacturers, including the world's largest contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW), are a key part of the global supply chain for technology giants including Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

The data for April will be released on Friday.

TAIPEI, May 19 (Reuters) - Roughly half of Taiwanese companies that had previously suspended work in China due to COVID-19 control measures have resumed production as curbs ease, the island's economy minister said on Thursday.

Shanghai and neighbouring Kunshan, a hub for Taiwanese electronics makers including Apple (AAPL.O) supplier Quanta Computer Inc (2382.TW), last month imposed stringent lockdowns to control the country's biggest COVID outbreak.

After managing to bring community transmission down to zero, Shanghai has begun reopening and is aiming for normal life to fully resume by June. read more

""The resumption rate now is at about 50%. If everything goes well, we are hoping for a full resumption in June,"" Economy Minister Wang Mei-hua told reporters in Taipei.

Wang said companies were still facing problems such as supply chain bottlenecks and logistics issues and that the situation could change depending on China's pandemic prevention policies.

149,653,APPLE,2022-05-20,Netflix to pay $59 million to settle Italian tax dispute,"













MILAN, May 20 (Reuters) - U.S. streaming service Netflix has agreed to settle a tax dispute with Italy, the company and legal sources said on Friday.

Milan prosecutors issued a statement saying they had settled with a multinational video on-demand streaming company for a period covering Oct. 2015 to 2019 and asked it to pay 55.8 million euros ($59.1 million).

They gave the settlement figure without specifically naming the company involved but three sources with knowledge of the matter confirmed it was Netflix.

A Netflix spokesperson said the company was pleased to have the matter finalised.

""We have maintained constant dialogue and cooperation with the Italian authorities and continue to believe that we have acted in full compliance with Italian and international rules,"" the spokesperson said.

Prosecutors had opened an investigation into potential tax evasion three years ago.

They claimed Netflix should have paid taxes in Italy because it relied on digital infrastructure to stream content to 2 million users in the country.

As a backdrop to the payment agreement, Netflix has now opened an office in Italy, setting up a base in Rome and hiring more than 40 employees.

The investigation by Milan prosecutors who argued that cables and computer servers used by Netflix amounted to a physical presence in Italy, had been triggered by checks conducted by Italy's tax police.

Milan prosecutors in the past have probed other U.S. tech giants such as Apple, Amazon and Facebook for dodging taxes, allowing Italy to net several billion euros in fines and tax payments.

HAMBURG, May 20 (Reuters) - Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) supervisory board has called on management to present a reworked plan for the carmaker's software division, which forms the backbone of its strategy but has run into problems, two people familiar with the matter said.

The board is expecting an update at the last supervisory board meeting before the summer break, one of the people said, adding no date has been set yet.

""What the board has presented is not enough,"" said the other person.

Volkswagen declined to comment.

Volkswagen has called its software division, which is the central element in its autonomous driving push, ""the most ambitious project of our entire industry to tap into the most relevant profit pools of the future"".

Cariad plans to challenge existing software incumbents, including Apple (AAPL.O) and Tesla (TSLA.O), but has hit bumps in the road, which could become a problem for VW boss Herbert Diess, who is responsible for the unit on the group's management board.

Spiegel first reported the news, not citing where it obtained the information, adding that the problems at Cariad, which have caused delays to product launches at Europe's top carmaker, had been discussed at a supervisory board meeting on May 11.

Software has been a sore spot for Europe's largest carmaker ever since the use of illegal defeat devices resulted in the ""dieselgate"" scandal at Volkswagen in 2015, the largest such case to date.

May 20 (Reuters) - Match Group Inc (MTCH.O) said on Friday that Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google will temporarily allow the dating apps maker to offer users a choice in payment systems.

Match sued Google earlier in May, calling the action a ""last resort"" to prevent Tinder and its other apps from being booted off the Google Play store for refusing to share up to 30% of sales. read more

The date for the trial is currently set for April 2023.

The company said on Friday it has withdrawn its request for a temporary restraining order against Google after it made a number of concessions that would prevent Match's apps from being removed from the Play store for offering alternate payment options.

Match will have to continue to integrate Google Play billing through the trial or until the dispute is settled, Google said.

Match's lawsuit came against the backdrop of ongoing cases brought by ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games, dozens of U.S. state attorneys general and others in targeting Google's allegedly anticompetitive conduct related to the Play store.

Google had said it will block downloads of some of Match's apps by June 1 unless they solely offered Google's payment system and shared revenue, the lawsuit stated.

The majority of users on Match's most popular app, Tinder, prefer its payment system, which allows for installment plans, bank transfers and other features not provided by Google, according to the lawsuit.

Match said on Friday it plans to put up to $40 million into an escrow account, instead of paying Google directly for billing transactions on the Android operating system outside of Google Play store billing, as part of the temporary agreement.

Match has raised concerns over Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) App Store fees and payments policies as well. read more

Apple has also been criticized for building its App Store into a ""walled garden"" meant to extract fees from developers who want to access users on the iOS ecosystem.

Google and Apple charge developers hefty commissions and impose controls on software developers, forcing them to pay a sum when the in-app payment systems are used.

152,737,APPLE,2022-05-24,Russia's no. 1 mobile operator MTS starts selling used and discounted smartphones,"













May 24 (Reuters) - Russia's biggest mobile operator MTS (MTSS.MM) said on Tuesday it has started selling discounted and used smartphones, offering Russian consumers cheaper alternatives as inflation bites and Western brands suspend shipments.

Apple (AAPL.O) paused all product sales in Russia in early March, one of many Western companies to distance itself from Moscow since it sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special military operation.

Sales of Chinese smartphone brands in Russia doubled in the first two weeks of March, Kommersant newspaper reported at the time.

Now, MTS is offering smartphones from Chinese brands Huawei [RIC:RIC:HWT.UL], Honor and Xiaomi (1810.HK), as well as South Korean producer Samsung (005930.KS), for up to 50% less than new devices at its Moscow stores and online. MTS said the brands offered and locations where they are sold would be expanded.

""This is a good opportunity for our company to offer consumers an additional way to save on purchases of quality gadgets,"" said Pavel Sukhovarov, head of MTS' retail network development, who said consumers could now buy used gadgets at bargain prices.

Inflation is hovering above 17%, eating into Russians' purchasing power, although the central bank has said the firming rouble and a decline in recently elevated consumer demand are helping to put the brakes on.

Discounted devices that MTS is selling include models that were returned within two weeks or have a packaging defect, and will come with a 90-day warranty.

The telecoms company last week reported a 76.2% year-on-year drop in first-quarter net profit to 3.9 billion roubles ($67.83 million) which it blamed in part on higher interest rates. read more

PARIS, May 24 (Reuters) - A global digital tax deal might not be ready until the end 2023 or early 2024, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Tuesday, flagging a big delay to the reform's implementation.

The deal, which officials had hoped to sign off on at the middle of this year, aims to reallocate rights to tax big digital groups such as Apple and Google to the countries where the end clients are located.

It is the first of two pillars of a major overhaul of the rules of cross-border taxation which also include plans for a global minimum corporate tax of 15% on big multinationals.

""As far as Pillar I is concerned - digital taxation - we won't spare our efforts to convince the international community and the members of the OECD to do their best efforts to have a consensus in the coming months,"" Le Maire said after chairing a meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels.

""It might be the end of 2023, it might be the beginning of 2024, the key point is to have a total overhaul of the international taxation system,"" Le Maire added.

Nearly 140 countries agreed last October to rewrite the rules of international taxation for the first time in a generation, setting a 2023 deadline for implementation.

Law firms Related documents Apple says it should be able to challenge Qualcomm patents despite settlement

Government agrees with appeals court decision to toss the case















(Reuters) - The Justice Department on Tuesday urged the U.S. Supreme Court to deny a bid by Apple Inc to revive a patent fight with Qualcomm Inc over mobile technology.

The brief by U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said a federal appeals court was correct to rule that Apple lacked standing to continue efforts to cancel two Qualcomm patents after reaching a global settlement with the chip maker.

A Justice Department spokesperson said Wednesday that the agency would let the brief speak for itself. Apple, Qualcomm and their attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Qualcomm sued Apple in 2017 in Southern California federal court for infringing the two patents. Apple challenged the patents' validity at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's Patent Trial and Appeal Board, which ruled for Qualcomm.

The parties settled their litigation in 2019 before Apple appealed, signing an agreement worth billions of dollars that allowed Apple to continue using Qualcomm chips in iPhones. The settlement also contained a six-year license to tens of thousands of Qualcomm patents including the two at issue but allowed Apple's PTAB proceedings to continue.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said last year that Apple could not continue its appeal after settling the underlying dispute. It rejected Apple's contentions that its royalty payments and risk of being sued again justified hearing the case.

Apple asked the Supreme Court in November to revive the dispute.

""Qualcomm has already asserted the patents against Apple and has not disclaimed its intention to do so again,"" Apple said.

The U.S. government's Tuesday brief said that while Apple could ""eventually"" be sued sometime after the license expires, it had not provided any evidence that it was likely to make or sell more products that could be accused of infringing.

The brief also said Qualcomm's patents were not causing Apple any concrete harm. It noted that Apple did not say invalidating the patents would affect its agreement with Qualcomm or that the patents were keeping it from making any specific products.

Apple did not show that a win would ""redress any injury to it--or, indeed, would have any real-world effect"" on it at all, the brief said.

The case is Apple Inc v. Qualcomm Inc, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 21-746.

May 25 (Reuters) - Individual investors are buying stocks at a pace akin to the 2021 meme-stock frenzy even as the returns on retail investments sit at multi-year lows amid a widespread sell-off on concerns about rising interest rates, Vanda Research said.

Retail investors bought stocks worth $76 billion during a three-month period ending on May 24, or $1.3 billion a day on average, compared with net purchases of $80.6 billion, or $1.32 billion a day, between January and March 2021, Vanda data showed.

The investors last year shot to fame when they banded together on online forums to fuel gains in highly-shorted GameStop (GME.N) and AMC Entertainment (AMC.N) and others that cost hedge funds billions of dollars.

However, shares of retail darlings have since plummeted. GameStop has lost about half its value over the past year and AMC a quarter, compared with S&P 500's (.SPX) 6% slide.

The performance of retail investors' portfolio compared to broader markets in the last three months was the worst ever recorded by Vanda, which has data from the start of 2014.

That has not deterred small-time investors from buying shares of their favorite tech and growth companies such as Apple (AAPL.O), Tesla (TSLA.O) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) over the past week, per Vanda, when the benchmark S&P 500 came within spitting distance of confirming a bear market territory.

DAVOS, Switzerland, May 25 (Reuters) - Vedanta will finalize a location for its $20 billion semiconductor and display plants in India by mid-June and will have the first chip product ready in two years, its Chairman Anil Agarwal said on Wednesday.

Oil-to-metals conglomerate Vedanta (VDAN.NS) said in February it will diversify into chip manufacturing and announced plans to form a joint venture with Taiwan's Foxconn (2317.TW) to support Prime Minister Narendra Modi's drive to make India a semiconductor manufacturing hub.

Vedanta has a total planned investment outlay of $20 billion for two separate units for chip and display manufacturing.

""Foxconn is our technical partner. We may not take equity partner for the fab,"" Agarwal told Reuters in an interview in Davos, adding that the Apple contract manufacturer will have technical responsibility for the operation, from providing the tech to making semiconductors.

Vedanta is seeking incentives from Modi's government and is also in talks with several Indian states on the unit's location.

Agarwal said on the sidelines of the annual World Economic Forum the first phase of Vedanta's project will entail an investment of $2 billion.

Private equity wants to be part of India's semiconductor expansion and there was no shortage of funds, he said, while adding that Vedanta was yet to hold talks with PE firms.

India estimates its semiconductor market will reach $63 billion by 2026, compared with $15 billion in 2020.

""You have to create another Taiwan in India,"" Agarwal said, noting that India will have to focus on bringing the entire semiconductor ecosystem locally for it to be a global powerhouse.

The Indian government has said it will expand incentives beyond an initial $10-billion plan for those investing in semiconductor manufacturing, as it aims to become a key player in the global supply chain for chips.

WASHINGTON, May 26 (Reuters) - Republican senators want to bar U.S. app stores including Apple and Google from hosting apps that allow payments to be made with China's digital currency, amid fears the payment system could allow Beijing to spy on Americans.

The bill, unveiled Thursday and first reported by Reuters, states that companies that own or control app stores ""shall not carry or support any app in [their] app store(s) within the United States that supports or enables transactions in e-CNY."" It is sponsored by Senators Tom Cotton, Marco Rubio and Mike Braun.

According to Cotton's office, digital yuan could provide the Chinese government with ""real-time visibility into all transactions on the network, posing privacy and security concerns for American persons who join this network.""

The Center for a New American Security, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, said in a January 2021 report that China's digital currency and electronic payments system was ""likely to be a boon for CCP surveillance in the economy and for government interference in the lives of Chinese citizens,"" noting that ""transactions will contain precise data about users and their financial activity.""

The move comes after WeChat, a messaging and payment application owned by China's Tencent with over 1.2 billion users, announced it would begin supporting the currency earlier this year. Alipay, the hugely popular payments app owned by Jack Ma's Ant Group, also accepts the digital currency. Both apps are available in the Apple and Google App stores.

Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, Ant Group (688688.SS) and Tencent (0700.HK) did not respond to requests for comment.

The Chinese Embassy in Washington called the legislation ""another example of the United States wantonly bullying foreign companies by abusing state power on the untenable ground of national security.""

While stopping potential national security threats related to China is a rare point of bipartisan agreement in the deeply divided U.S. Congress, prospects for the bill's passage ahead of midterm elections are uncertain.

160,279,APPLE,2022-05-26,Deere tapping into Apple-like tech model to drive revenue,"













BONDURANT, Iowa, May 26 (Reuters) - Deere & Co (DE.N) has sold its tractors and other equipment to farmers for decades, but the world's largest agriculture machinery manufacturer is tearing a page from the technology world's playbook - combining cutting-edge hardware with software and subscription models to drive revenue growth.

In a world with a dwindling number of grain producers and a growing population, Deere and its rivals are developing self-driving equipment loaded with the latest software that is harvesting a new kind of bumper crop: data. All that translates into recurring revenue, something companies like Apple have long enjoyed and industrial manufacturers like Deere hungrily eye.

""The more technology we can develop to allow farmers to get productivity out of their land without having to spend so much money on fertilizer and inputs, the better off everybody is,"" Julian Sanchez, Deere's director of emerging technology, told Reuters.

Investments in automation for high-horsepower equipment is only at its inception for Deere and rivals AGCO (AGCO.N) and CNH Industrial (CNHI.MI). The next step is to equip machines to plant seeds using satellite imagery and soil data, Sanchez said.

While Deere has not outlined what that could mean to its bottom line, last fall U.S. automaker General Motors Co (GM.N) said it was targeting up to $25 billion in software-driven services by 2030, and added its Cruise self-driving unit could achieve $50 billion in annual revenue within six years. read more

The race among farm equipment companies to automate agriculture has accelerated amid a burgeoning food crisis. And Deere's strategy around scaling its suite of tech products is now in the spotlight, after the manufacturer's stock plunged 14% on May 20 following a quarterly revenue miss. It was the biggest drop for Deere in 14 years.

The timing comes as the war in Ukraine and widespread drought in key grain-producing countries have roiled commodity markets, causing grain and farm input prices to spike as supplies shrink. That, in turn, has U.S. farmers scrambling to boost crop yields, yet limit their fertilizer and pesticide use. read more

That and a shrinking farm labor workforce has opened the door for Deere and others to make their high-tech push. For farmers, the prize is higher crop yields. For Illinois-based Deere, it's the revenue.

Autonomous machinery is where Deere is placing its bet as artificial intelligence becomes more integrated in farming. Its self-driving 8R tillage tractor will be the latest addition to the company's algorithm-enabled offerings when the green machines go on sale in the fall.

The new tractor will be priced at $500,000. However, the autonomy feature will be sold separately. Deere executives told analysts at a conference that the company will largely maintain its ""point-of-sale"" model for equipment, but will integrate a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model for its autonomous solutions. That will likely include their self-driving tractor.

""While it may take us a few years to build out a base of recurring revenues, autonomous solutions, on top of our underlying machine forms, will be recurring,"" said Joshua Jepsen, Deere's deputy financial officer.

Deere & Co. 8R autonomous tractor is pictured at Jensen Test Farm in Bondurant, Iowa, U.S., April 28, 2022. Picture taken April 28, 2022. REUTERS/Bianca Flowers

The recurring revenue model can be economically favorable to heavy machinery manufacturers ""based on those data insights,"" said Michael Staebe, a Bain & Company partner focused on machinery.

In Deere’s case, using a subscription model by either selling or leasing its driverless tractor can result in higher margins.

""After expenses, every incremental dollar falls straight to the bottom line,"" Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold said. ""We would expect it to be an attractive offering to farmers given the efficiency it offers them, and lucrative to Deere.""

AGRONOMIC DATA HELPS BOTTOM LINE

Farmers have long been wary about how machinery and supplier firms profit off the data gleaned from their operations, and how secure such data is. But with farmers facing economic pressures, Deere and other manufacturers said it is easier to sell farmers on making such investments.

One key reason: The ability to glean crop insights from huge amounts of agronomic data takes the guesswork out of when to plant and how many seeds to use - which saves farmers money.

""Everybody in the industry is much more data-focused than we have ever seen them,"" said Michael Boehlje, a professor at Purdue University. ""(Companies) can do profit projections by geographic space in fields. That takes you to a different level of thinking and analysis.”

In 2020, Deere acquired Harvest Profit, a farm profitability software company that has been integrated into the John Deere Operations Center. The platform stores and lets farmers access their machine data from the cloud.

""When I look at what precision ag has done for our operations and what we can accomplish in a day's time compared to 10 to 20 years ago, it's so much easier,"" said Jeremy Jack, a row crop farmer in Mississippi and chief executive of Silent Shade Planting Co.

Ron Heck's fleet of Case IH combines and tractors are equipped with automated steering to harvest his 4,000 acres where he rotates soybeans and corn.

The fourth-generation farmer in Iowa said some of his new equipment is loaded with technology. ""Unfortunately for us it costs more, but hopefully the costs will be paid back in the long run by better efficiency.""

161,106,APPLE,2022-05-26,Apple to keep iPhone production flat in 2022 - Bloomberg News,"













May 26 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) plans to keep iPhone production for 2022 roughly flat at about 220 million units, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, as China's COVID-19 curbs, global supply chain issues, and cooling demand continue to hurt smartphone makers.

An outbreak of COVID-19 in China has kept its financial hub Shanghai largely paralysed by a city-wide lockdown — now in its seventh week. Beijing, meanwhile, has ramped up its quarantine efforts. read more

The iPhone maker's supplier Foxconn (2317.TW) has been able to keep its workers on-site in a ""closed loop"" system to limit the impact on production, but lockdowns in the country have pushed many to sound demand-related warnings.

Apple had also said last month any new lockdowns in China and Taiwan, where many parts and iPhones are produced, could bring new obstacles in terms of supply and demand in the current quarter. read more

The developments also comes as investors brace for a drop in consumer spending on tech gadgets and services as the war in Ukraine drives up the cost of oil, food, and other staples.

Separately, Nikkei reported on Wednesday that the company had told its suppliers to speed up iPhone development after China's COVID-19 lockdowns hampered schedule for at least one of the new phones. read more

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

May 25 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) will raise the starting pay for its U.S. employees, the iPhone maker said on Wednesday, as companies face a tight labor market and a surge in unionization efforts amid rising inflation.

The starting pay for the company's U.S. team members will rise to $22 per hour, or higher based upon the market, a 45% jump from 2018 levels, Apple said in a statement to Reuters.

""This year as part of our annual performance review process, we're increasing our overall compensation budget,"" a company spokesperson said.

Apple has informed some workers their annual reviews would be advanced by three months and the new pay will take effect in early July, the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the changes in compensation, said.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for further details on the compensation changes.

Cupertino, California-based Apple is known for its reticent culture, but last year some current and former workers began criticizing the company's working conditions online.

In April, workers at Apple's Atlanta store filed a petition to hold a union election, seeking to become the company's first U.S. store to unionize amid a wave of labor activity at other major firms. read more

Google (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) are among other tech companies that have revised performance reviews or adjusted pay this year as they fight to retain workers.

Summary Law firms

Law firms Related documents California federal judge says claims not time-barred, can move forward

Apple's Gibson Dunn team directed to respond in June















(Reuters) - Apple Inc on Thursday lost a bid to dismiss a lawsuit in California federal court from competing app store Cydia, which accused the iPhone maker of maintaining an unlawful monopoly over software distribution on its operating system.

U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, rejected Apple's contention that Cydia's allegations fell outside a four-year window allowed under federal antitrust law.

Gonzalez Rogers issued her ruling for plaintiff SaurikIT LLC, which developed Cydia, after dismissing an earlier legal challenge. She found the claims in the first lawsuit were outside the statute of limitations. But she allowed Cydia to bring a new complaint, which was filed in January.

Cydia's lawyers argued in the amended lawsuit that Apple's technology updates between 2018 and 2021 were ""overt"" acts that harmed iOS app distributors such as Cydia. In Thursday's ruling, Gonzalez Rogers said ""to the extent plaintiff's claims rely on Apple's technological updates to exclude Cydia from being able to operate altogether, those claims are timely.""

Apple and a lawyer for the company at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher did not immediately respond to messages on Friday seeking comment.

Cydia's lawyers at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan did not immediately respond to similar messages.

Apple's attorneys in February called Cydia's claims ""time-barred"" and ""stale"" and urged Gonzalez Rogers to dismiss the complaint and to bar any further effort to amend it.

Cydia's lawsuit ""seeks to open the markets for iOS app distribution and iOS app payment processing to those who wish to compete fairly with Apple, and to recover the enormous damages Apple caused Cydia.""

Cydia's case is similar to an antitrust lawsuit that Fortnite maker Epic Games Inc brought against Apple in 2020 over its removal of the popular video game from the App Store. Apple pulled Fortnite after Epic set up a payment system that went around Apple's 30% commission on in-app purchases.

Gonzalez Rogers largely ruled for Apple last year, and the case is now pending in the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Gonzalez Rogers directed Apple to respond by mid-June to Cydia's complaint.

The case is SaurikIT LLC v. Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 4:20-cv-08733-YGR.

For SaurikIT: Adam Wolfson and Stephen Swedlow of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan

For Apple: Jay Srinivasan of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher

164,550,APPLE,2022-05-27,"Russia opens cases against Google, other foreign tech over data storage","













May 27 (Reuters) - Russia's communications regulator Roskomnadzor said on Friday it had opened administrative cases against Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and six other foreign technology companies for alleged violations of personal data legislation.

Moscow has clashed with Big Tech over content, censorship, data and local representation in a simmering dispute that has erupted into a full-on information battle since Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Russia fined Google 3 million roubles ($46,540) last year for not storing the personal data of Russian users in databases on Russian territory, and on Friday said it had opened a new case over what it called Google's repeated failure to comply with Russian legislation.

Google, which declined to comment, could be fined between 6-18 million roubles, Roskomnadzor said.

The regulator also said it had opened cases against six other companies - Airbnb, Pinterest, Likeme, Twitch, Apple and United Parcel Service - for alleged first-time offences carrying a potential fine of 1-6 million roubles.

Likeme could not be reached, while the other five companies had no immediate comment.

165,767,APPLE,2022-05-31,Foxconn predicts more stable supply chain in the second half of 2022,"













TAIPEI, May 31 (Reuters) - Taiwan's Foxconn (2317.TW), the world's largest contract electronics maker, said on Tuesday that the second half of the year is heading ""in a better direction"" as Shanghai's COVID-19 lockdown appears to be easing.

""We are quite confident in the stability of our supply chain for the second half of this year,"" Foxconn chairman Liu Young-way told the company's annual shareholder meeting.

The Shanghai government will allow all residents in 'low-risk' areas to return to work from Tuesday. [nB9N2XA00P}

Foxconn is aiming to become the first electric vehicle (EV) maker ""not short on material supplies"", Liu said, referring to a prolonged global chip shortage that has forced carmakers to halt production and hurt smartphone production including for Apple Inc (AAPL.O), a major client.

""A car that costs tens of thousands of dollars cannot be shipped because of a tiny chip worth fifty cents. This has been a pain for our customers,"" he said.

Foxconn is aiming to capture around 5% of the global electric vehicle market by the end of 2025 and has said it is hoping to boost its capacity to make EV chips, many of which are small lower-end integrated circuits including those used in power management.

The company warned this month that revenue for its electronics business including smartphones could slip this quarter due to rising inflation, cooling demand and escalating supply chain issues partly due to lockdowns in China. read more

Foxconn reiterated that while China's strict COVID-19 controls in China had only a limited impact on production as it kept workers on-site in a ""closed loop"" system, demand for its products in the country has suffered as people remain shut in.

Foxconn's shares closed up 2.3%, outperforming a 1.2% rise in the broader market (.TWII). They have gained 8.7% so far this year, giving the company a market value of $52.3 billion.

166,874,APPLE,2022-05-31,U.S. investigates Chinese companies over export sanction issues,"













WASHINGTON, May 31 (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Tuesday the Biden administration is actively considering adding new Chinese companies to the government's economic blacklist as it investigates what it calls efforts by China to evade U.S. sanctions.

The Commerce Department's Entity List restricts access to U.S. exports.

Raimondo told reporters the administration was working to ""get information around bad actors in China and adding those companies to the Entity List ... We are in the middle of a number of investigations.""

She added: ""I don't see us relaxing sanctions any time soon.""

China is not standing still, she said. ""They are coming up with we know new ways to evade our sanctions, setting up new (companies) and the like. We have a very aggressive and vigilant effort under way.""

She said when possible she wants to work with U.S. allies to align their trade restrictions with U.S. export controls.

The Trump administration aggressively used the Entity List, adding dozens of Chinese companies including Huawei (HWT.UL) in 2019. It also added chipmaker SMIC (0981.HK) and Chinese drone manufacturer DJI in 2020.

The Biden administration has extended that policy and in November put a dozen Chinese companies on the Entity List over national security and foreign policy concerns, in some cases citing their help in developing the Chinese military’s quantum computing efforts.

In December, Commerce added China's Academy of Military Medical Sciences and its 11 research institutes to the Entity List.

Raimondo cited a recent report that Apple Inc (AAPL.O) was considering moving some production out of China. ""I've heard that same thing from numerous other American manufacturing companies, many of whom have been manufacturing in China for decades,"" she said.

In February, the Commerce Department added 33 Chinese entities to its ""unverified list"" which requires U.S. exporters to go through more procedures before shipping goods to the entities.

China’s embassy in Washington said last year the United States ""uses the catch-all concept of national security and abuses state power to suppress and restrict Chinese enterprises in all possible means.""

WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - Big tech has launched a media blitz aimed at derailing one of the most ground-breaking bipartisan bills in the U.S. that would bar tech companies, like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), from giving preference to their own businesses on their websites.

Amazon lambasted the bill on Wednesday saying in a blog post that the bill ""jeopardizes two of the things American consumers love most about Amazon: the vast selection and low prices made possible by opening our store to third-party selling partners, and the promise of fast, free shipping through Amazon Prime.""

It argued the bill targets one retailer, Amazon, by requiring a market value of at least $550 billion to qualify for regulation, thus excluding Walmart (WMT.N)and Target (TGT.N).

Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar and Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican, are lead co-sponsors of the bill.

A spokesperson for Klobuchar, when asked about the Amazon post, said: ""Who do you trust? The largest online retailer in America with a demonstrated record of stiffing small businesses and lying about this bill’s impact, or small businesses themselves?""

The spokesperson also listed business groups, which back the bill, including Small Business Rising and Main Street Alliance.

The Senate could vote on the bill as early as this month, a source familiar with the situation said, helping explain the growing voice of opposition. The measure passed the Senate Judiciary Committee in January, despite hefty lobbying from top executives like Apple (AAPL.O) Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook. read more It also passed the House Judiciary Committee last year.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in a letter to the Senate Tuesday, called the bill ""misguided"" and said it would ""be an overhaul of the American economy, one sector at a time.""

Pro-tech groups that oppose the bill include the Chamber of Progress, TechNet and the Computer & Communications Industry Association.

The Chamber of Progress said late last month that the bill, if it became law, would ""break popular consumer products,"" specifically Amazon Prime, Google Maps and Apple apps for the iPhone. It's been running an online ad saying ""Senator Klobuchar wants to erase Amazon Basics,"" Amazon branded products.

Senate sponsors have said if the bill becomes law that Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google would be allowed to show maps and answer queries, that companies could offer free shipping and cell phones that could be sold with pre-installed apps.

Amazon argued the bill could harm the hundreds of thousands of small businesses that sell goods on its website as its large fines for violations ""would make it difficult to justify the risk of Amazon offering a marketplace in which selling partners can participate.""

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson















June 2 (Reuters) - California port leaders expect imports to rise as Shanghai, home to the world's busiest seaport, emerges from a two-month COVID-19 lockdown.

The question is whether that release of pent-up goods will again swamp West Coast ports that have recently emerged from the pandemic's massive cargo wave, they and other experts said.

The Port of Shanghai was open during the city's shutdown, but cargo flows still slowed. Area factories that make everything from Tesla (TSLA.O) electric vehicles to Apple (AAPL.O) laptops ran out of components and quarantines idled some truckers. read more

As the city returns to normal, trade should follow.

""We will have some form of a surge, given the delay of cargo volume from Shanghai and China overall,"" Mario Cordero, executive director of the Port of Long Beach, said on the sidelines of a Reuters Events logistics conference in Chicago.

""To what extent that surge will be remains to be seen,"" Cordero said.

The Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex is the busiest in the United States. The Port of Shanghai is its second-biggest source of container trade cargo, behind Port of Shenzen.

When Shanghai closed, some factories there re-routed goods to other ports that trade with Southern California.

April imports soared 9.2% to a new monthly record at the Port of Long Beach.

""The question is - but for lockdowns and slowdowns, what would have been that percentile?"" said Cordero. He expects the Shanghai surge to begin this month - landing alongside back-to-school goods, Fall fashions and early Christmas shipments.

April imports fell 6.8% at the Port of Los Angeles, giving it a chance to prepare for the Shanghai uptick. The port thinned its cargo backlog and cut the queue of ships waiting to unload to about two dozen - the lowest number in about a year, Executive Director Gene Seroka, said in a telephone interview.

171,168,APPLE,2022-06-02,Apple to improve working hours for retail staff - Bloomberg News,"













June 2 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) will make work schedules for retail staff flexible amid a push towards unionization, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, citing sources.

The company told staff at some stores that scheduling changes will take effect in coming months, the report said, quoting workers. The changes will include extending the minimum time period between shifts to 12 hours from 10 hours.

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Last week, the iPhone maker told Reuters it will raise pay for its U.S. employees to $22 per hour or more. read more

The Cupertino, California-based company, known for its reticent culture, was last year criticized online for its working conditions by some current and former workers.

In April, workers at Apple's Atlanta store filed a petition to hold a union election, seeking to become the company's first U.S. store to unionize amid a wave of labor activity at other major firms. read more

Meanwhile, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Thursday it will not resist unionization efforts by its employees as it recognizes their legal right to choose to form or join a union.

172,544,APPLE,2022-06-03,Wall St ends down with strong jobs data keeping the pressure on for rate hikes,"Summary

Summary Companies Apple, Tesla are S&P's biggest drags

Solid jobs report keeps focus on rate hike expectations

Indexes fall: Dow 1.05%, S&P 1.63%, Nasdaq 2.47%















June 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street's three major stock indexes ended lower on Friday after a solid jobs report ate in to hopes for a pause in the Federal Reserve's aggressive policy-tightening which is needed to cool decades-high inflation.

The technology-heavy Nasdaq led the declines, falling 2.5% as shares of market heavyweights Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) were the biggest drags on the market.

Earlier, the Labor Department's closely watched report showed nonfarm payrolls rose by 390,000 jobs last month and wages grew, while the unemployment rate held steady at 3.6% - all signs of a tight labor market. read more

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that nonfarm payrolls would rise by 325,000 jobs. read more

While the jobs report was reassuring for the current state of the economy, investors focused primarily on its potential influence on central bank policy.

""The market is trying to funnel its response through what the Fed may or may not do,"" said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP, who expects the market to continue to seesaw as a result of uncertainty around interest rates and inflation.

Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi Personal Wealth Management, saw the solid report as a double-edged sword.

""It's telling us the economy is in fairly good shape which is good news but when viewed in the context of what it means for the Federal Reserve and tightening monetary policy it likely makes them more confident they can continue to tighten,"" he said. ""That comes through as a bit of a negative for investors because they're hoping for the Fed to pause later this year.""

Money markets are fully pricing in 50 basis-point rate hikes by the Fed in June and July.

While the May report's slower-than-expected increase in hourly earnings looked like good news for inflation, Snyder cited rising oil prices as an offsetting factor.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 348.58 points, or 1.05%, to 32,899.7, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 68.28 points, or 1.63%, to 4,108.54 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 304.16 points, or 2.47%, to 12,012.73.

Among the S&P's 11 major sectors consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) was the weakest with a 2.9% drop followed by technology's (.SPLRCT) 2.5% drop. The energy index (.SPNY), up 1.4%, was the only gainer of the pack, as oil prices rose.

For the week, the S&P 500 fell 1.2% while the Nasdaq declined 0.98% and the Dow lost 0.94% after all three indexes had risen sharply the week before.

Volatility has gripped Wall Street in recent weeks as investors debated whether markets had hit a bottom against the backdrop of some hawkish comments from Fed officials and data suggesting that inflation may have peaked. read more

""For right now, the economy looks OK. And the labor market as a signal of the real economy on Main Street looks incredibly solid,"" said ADP's Richardson, adding she sees inflation as ""a threat to that outlook"" even if it may have peaked.

""The peak is less relevant than the staying power of inflation and elevated rates,"" she said. ""That's why wages in this report were so material. While wage growth may not drive up inflation past the peak, it could play a strong role in keeping inflation around these higher levels much longer than anybody wants or anticipates.""

IPhone maker Apple finished down 3.9% after a bearish brokerage outlook and a report that EU countries and lawmakers would agree next week on a common charging port for mobile devices and headphones - a proposal Apple has criticized.

Tesla shares sank 9.2% after CEO Elon Musk, in an email to executives seen by Reuters, said he has a ""super bad feeling"" about the economy and needs to cut about 10% of jobs at the electric car maker. read more

Meanwhile, after markets closed, FTSE Russell was due to reveal an early list of index members as a part of its annual reconstitution aimed at reflecting shifts in the broader market.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.68-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.79-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 1 new 52-week high and 29 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 32 new highs and 88 new lows.

On U.S. exchanges 9.42 billion shares changed hands on Friday compared with the 12.89 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

173,290,APPLE,2022-06-03,Exclusive: EU deal on single mobile charging port likely June 7 in setback for Apple,"













BRUSSELS, June 3 (Reuters) - EU countries and EU lawmakers are set to agree on a common charging port for mobile phones, tablets and headphones on June 7 when they meet to discuss a proposal that has been fiercely criticised by Apple (AAPL.O), people familiar with the matter said.

The proposal for a single mobile charging port was first broached by the European Commission more than a decade ago after iPhone and Android users complained about having to use different chargers for their phones.

The former is charged from a Lightning cable while Android-based devices are powered using USB-C connectors.

The trilogue next Tuesday will be the second and likely the final one between EU countries and EU lawmakers on the topic, an indication of a strong push to get a deal done, the people said.

Outstanding issues include broadening the scope of the proposal to laptops, a key demand by EU lawmakers that is likely to impact Samsung (005930.KS) and Huawei [RIC:RIC:HWT.UL] and other device makers, the people said.

EU lawmakers also want to include wireless charging systems to be harmonised by 2025 while EU countries and the Commission wants a longer lead-in period for technical reasons.

Apple was not immediately available for comment. It has previously said the inappropriate use of dated international standards stifles innovation and that forcing users to change to new chargers could create a mountain of electronic waste.

174,112,APPLE,2022-06-06,Apple dives deeper into autos with software for car dashboard,"













CUPERTINO, Calif., June 6 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Monday announced it would more deeply integrate its software into the core driving systems of cars, while the iPhone maker rolled out a slew of features for payments and business collaboration and a pair of new laptops.

The announcements at Apple's annual developer conference showed a company that was once an outsider working its way firmly into the mainstream of nearly every screen in day-to-day life. read more

The company whose late 1990s turnaround meant branding itself for rebels and troublemakers spent Monday talking up how to use iPads to collaborate on business presentations and how its software will eventually help display fuel economy on car dashboards. Notably absent were any hints of Apple's expected next big product, a mixed-reality headset that can overlay digital objects on a view of the real world. Hopeful fans got only a few tidbits of new augmented reality technology at a technical talk.

And Apple announced Apply Pay Later, a service that lets users make interest-free installments. The business, which will work over the MasterCard Inc (MA.N) network wherever Apple Pay is accepted, puts Apple in direction competition with payment providers like Affirm Holdings Inc (AFRM.O) and PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O).

But mostly Apple doubled down on existing products. A MacBook Air laptop was redesigned around a new M2 silicon processor, which it says is 35% faster than the previous M1 chip. The new laptop will be 2.7 pounds (1.2 kg) and have a 1080p high-definition camera to provide better images on video calls. The MacBook Air will start at $1,199, Apple announced at its WWDC 2022 conference.

The M2 chip will also power the 13-inch MacBook Pro, which will start at $1,299 and be available next month. Both chips will use a second generation of 5-nanometer chip manufacturing technology. Apple did not say who would make the chip, but likely manufacturers include longtime Apple partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW), which is struggling with delays of newer technology.

""They have to do volume"" with the new laptops, said Bob O'Donnell of TECHnalysis Research. ""That's the safe choice,"" he said of the 5-nanometer chips.

But Apple did break with its tradition of not tipping its hand about future technology when it showed off a new car dashboard that it said would be able to display data from major instruments such as speed, fuel levels and gas mileage. Apple said it was in talks with automakers such as Ford Motor Co (F.N), Nissan Motor Co (7201.T), Mercedes-Benz (MBGn.DE) and Honda Motor Corp (7267.T). Vehicles with the software will not be announced until late next year.

The software connects more deeply into core driving systems than prior versions that were limited to the vehicle's infotainment displays for playing music and showing maps. While Apple's car software has been in vehicles since 2014 is currently available in more than 600 models - even including a few motorcycles - it is largely separate from the vehicle's own operating systems. Vehicles owners must leave the system for even basic functions like adjusting a car's climate controls, a shortcoming the updated system is designed to address.

Polestar, the premium electric vehicle maker owned by China's Geely (GEELY.UL) and Volvo Cars, is installing the current version of Apple CarPlay into its Polestar 2 cars through an over-the-air update later this month, Polestar spokesman JP Canton said. Which Polestar cars will get the newer version Apple announced on Monday are under discussion and no further information was available, he said.

A spokeswoman for Ford, which announced a software deal with Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google last year, declined to comment on Apple's announcement. Automakers remain wary of allowing the tech giants unfettered access to the data generated by connected cars, or to allow them to displace the automakers' brands with their own in dashboard displays.

Apple's iPad also received a revamp to make it easier for users to juggle multiple applications and displays and to collaborate on business-centric documents such as presentations. The company also previewed an app called Freeform, which will act as a virtual whiteboard that multiple users can tap to share ideas during video meetings over Apple's FaceTime service. The productivity features put Apple in more direct competition with Microsoft (MSFT.O), whose Surface tablet computers are popular among business users.

Apple also added an edit button to iMessage for sent messages, beating Twitter (TWTR.N) to a long-requested feature.

The tech giant is also adding a tool called ""Safety Check"" to turn off access to sensitive information for people in abusive situations.

Apple introduced a new technology called Passkeys to replace passwords on websites. Apple said Passkeys are safer than traditional passwords because Passkeys are never stored on a web server. The company said it is working to enable the use of Passkeys with non-Apple devices.

Apple shares closed up less than 1%, similar to their level at the start of the presentation.

175,163,APPLE,2022-06-06,U.S. House speaker Pelosi discloses trades in Apple and Microsoft,"













June 6 (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi disclosed new stock market trades on Monday, showing purchases of options to buy shares of Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

In a periodic transaction report signed last Friday and appearing on the House of Representatives' website on Monday, the senior Democrat disclosed that her husband, financier Paul Pelosi, on May 13 bought Apple call options for between $500,001 and $1 million.

On May 24, he bought more Apple call options, in an amount between $250,001 and $500,000, the disclosure shows. On the same day, Paul Pelosi bought Microsoft call options for as much as $600,000.

Users on social media platforms including Twitter, Reddit, Youtube and TikTok have scrutinized Pelosi's trade disclosures in recent months, believing her position as House Speaker gives her and her husband an edge. read more

A 2012 law makes it illegal for lawmakers to use information from their work in Congress for their personal gain. The law requires them to disclose stock transactions by themselves or family members within 45 days.

Pelosi in January signaled that she might be willing to advance legislation to completely ban stock trading by lawmakers. That was a reversal from her previous position defending lawmakers' right to trade stocks.

Proposals by Democrats in Congress this year to prohibit stock trading by lawmakers have yet to pass.

Pelosi's stock trading performance ranked sixth-best in Congress in 2021, with Republican Congressman Austin Scott leading the way, according to an analysis by Unusual Whales, a service selling financial data.

Paul Pelosi's purchases of Apple and Microsoft options in May followed a steep Wall Street selloff this year related to worries about inflation and rising interest rates.

So far in 2022, Pelosi has filed six transaction reports, disclosing several trades in Apple, the world's most valuable company. She has also disclosed trades in Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), PayPal Holdings (PYPL.O) and other widely held stocks.

The Justice Department ended investigations of stock trades by at least three senators ahead of the 2020 market slump, caused by the coronavirus pandemic, without filing charges.

June 6 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Monday launched a software update to its iPhones, unveiled a buy now pay later service and introduced a MacBook Air powered with its latest M2 chip. read more

At the Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple's second major annual event, the tech giant showed off a new car dashboard that will come in new models including those of Ford and Jaguar, and the iPhone maker rolled out a slew of features for collaboration and data safety.

Here are the major launches made at the event:

IOS16 TO INCLUDE BUY NOW PAY LATER SERVICE

The latest operating system for iPhones will have a refreshed lockscreen that comes with new widgets, greater personalization and a new approach towards notifications.

Apple Pay Later will allow users to pay using Apple Pay where it is accepted and pay for it in four installments over six weeks, without any additional fee.

The new iOS will have feature fresh updates for CarPlay including new gauge clusters and automakers including Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Jaguar Land Rover will integrate the feature with their cars.

FASTER SILICON

Apple revealed the M2 chip, the successor to the company's first in-house chip, named M1.

The latest M2 chip, which comes with 24 gigabytes of unified memory, is 18% better than its predecessor and can playback multiple streams of 4K and 8K video.

Apple also launched a redesigned MacBook air and a MacBook Pro with the new chip.

UPGRADED MACBOOK

The powerful M2 chip will be loaded on a brand new MacBook Air, redesigned around the M2 chip. Weighing just 2.7 pounds, new Air is 11.3 inches thick, fitted with a 13.6 inch liquid Retina display and will have a Magsafe charging system. There is also headphone jack.

The MacBook Air will start at $1,199 and come in gray, gold, silver and blue.

MacBook Pro starts at $1,299. Both laptops will be available next month.

IPAD GETS NEW PRODUCTIVITY FEATURES

IPadOS 16 will include the Free Form productivity app, which will allow users to share ideas on FaceTime video meetings.

The iPad Pro will now be able to show groups of apps on a secondary screen, allowing for greater productivity in a bid to make iPad apps more ""desktop-like"".

WATCHOS TO HAVE IMPROVED HEALTH AND FITNESS FEATURES

Apple's new WatchOS 9 will bring new watch faces, new metrics for workouts and heart rate zones for exercise.

It also expects to receive the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's clearance for the atrial fibrillation health feature soon.

The software update will also help users build a medication list and remind them to take medicines.

TIGHTER SECURITY FEATURES

Apple also beefed up security features on the new iOS. It launched Safety Check in the settings app that lets users revoke access to personal data like location they had shared with other users.

Users can also logout from iCloud accounts on other devices for added safety from the Safety Check page.

MACOS GETS UPDATES

The new MacOS, dubbed Ventura, will have updates to the Mail app, camera software updates and improved productivity features.

June 6 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Monday announced significant updates to CarPlay at the Worldwide Developers Conference event, as the company looks to upgrade it from an infotainment system to a software solution that will allow drivers to control parts of their car and show more information such as speed and fuel level.

The iPhone maker said it is talking to several automakers to bring the new generation of the software to their cars, which will be announced from late 2023.

Here's what Apple is working on for CarPlay:

MULTIPLE SCREENS SUPPORT

CarPlay will support multiple screens on cars irrespective of size and layout and will be able to show information including weather and navigation, according to images posted during a presentation.

Widgets powered by the iPhone will be available across all screens in a vehicle including the instrument cluster, with multiple styles of dials, layouts, themes and colors.

AUTOMAKERS TO SUPPORT NEXT-GEN CARPLAY

Apple gave a long list of carmakers that could endorse the program. Among the prominent names are Ford Motor Co (F.N), Renault SA (RENA.PA), Mercedes Benz (MBGn.DE), Volvo (VOLCARb.ST), Honda Motor Co (7267.T) and Jaguar Land Rover.

INTEGRATION WITH IPHONE

With the next generation of CarPlay, drivers will be able to change temperature settings, use apps such as the Audiobooks, News, Podcasts and tune the car's radio without leaving the CarPlay interface.

The iPhone will communicate with the vehicle's systems in real time in a ""privacy-friendly way"" to show driving information such as speed, fuel level and temperature.

178,175,APPLE,2022-06-07,EU agrees single mobile charging port in blow to Apple,"Summary

Summary Companies Apple has until 2024 to make changes

Company has said the change will hurt innovation

Apple could gain sales boost from selling newer phones















BRUSSELS, June 7 (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) must change the connector on iPhones sold in Europe by 2024 after EU countries and lawmakers agreed on Tuesday to a single charging port for mobile phones, tablets and cameras in a world first.

The political intervention, which the European Commission said would make life easier for consumers and save them money, came after companies failed to reach a common solution.

Brussels has been pushing for a single mobile charging port for more than a decade, prompted by complaints from iPhone and Android users about having to switch to different chargers for their devices.

iPhones are charged from a Lightning cable, while Android-based devices use USB-C connectors.

The company, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, had earlier warned that the proposal would hurt innovation and create a mountain of electronics waste.

Despite that, its shares were up 0.9% in morning trade in New York.

The move could become a sales driver for Apple in 2024, analysts said, encouraging more Europeans to buy the latest gadgets instead of ones without USB-C.

It could persuade consumers to upgrade to a new phone sooner, said CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino.

""Existing consumers can still use the Lightning cable, but maybe there would be less purchases of older products on third-party platforms,"" he said.

Apple is already working on an iPhone with a USB-C charging port that could debut next year, Bloomberg reported last month.

When Apple releases new iPhones, the older generation phones are usually discounted, leading to millions of customers opting for the cheaper variants.

If the EU prohibits the sale of older models, it risks upsetting many consumers and the government would be forcing consumers to shell out more, said Jitesh Ubrani, research manager at research firm IDC.

Half the chargers sold with mobile phones in 2018 had a USB micro-B connector while 29% had a USB-C connector and 21% a Lightning connector, a 2019 Commission study showed.

""By autumn 2024, USB Type-C will become the common charging port for all mobile phones, tablets and cameras in the EU,"" the European Parliament said in a statement.

EU industry chief Thierry Breton said the deal would save about 250 million euros ($267 million) for consumers.

""It will also allow new technologies, such as wireless charging, to emerge and to mature without letting innovation become a source of market fragmentation and consumer inconvenience,"" he said.

Laptops will have to comply with the legislation within 40 months of it coming into force. The EU executive will have the power in future to harmonise wireless charging systems.

That the deal also covers e-readers, earbuds and other technologies means it will also have an impact on Samsung (005930.KS), Huawei (HWT.UL) and other device makers, analysts said.

""We are proud that laptops, e-readers, earbuds, keyboards, computer mice and portable navigation devices are also included,"" said lawmaker Alex Agius Saliba, who steered the debate at the European Parliament.

179,308,APPLE,2022-06-07,"Buy now, pay later stocks roiled by Apple's entry","













June 7 (Reuters) - Shares of buy now, pay later (BNPL) companies stumbled on Tuesday as the entry of Apple Inc (AAPL.O) threatened to ratchet up competition in a sector reeling from geopolitical tensions, regulatory scrutiny and rising interest rates.

The service, called Apple Pay Later, presents a direct challenge to Afterpay-owner Block Inc (SQ.N), PayPal Holdings (PYPL.O) and Affirm Holdings (AFRM.O) - the biggest BNPL player in the United States.

""(The) move into BNPL suddenly makes Apple the most accepted BNPL product out there,"" said Vincent Caintic, an analyst at Stephens Inc.

He added Apple has a big competitive advantage over industry players as its Apple Pay service was used by 85% of U.S. merchants, compared with rivals' relatively small presence.

Shares in Affirm, PayPal and Jack Dorsey-led Block fell between 1.1% and 4.8%, while Australia-listed peers Zip Co (ZIP.AX) and Sezzle Inc closed down 5.2% and 14.4%, respectively.

""Apple's latest BNPL offering competes with their products directly, adding to the gloomy outlook that BNPL firms will struggle to survive the cost-of-living crisis,"" said Kunal Sawhney, chief executive officer at Kalkine Group.

Even before Apple's entry, the sector was under pressure as a boom sparked by the pandemic fizzled out and governments ramped up oversight of what was a largely unregulated industry.

Responding to that pressure, Swedish fintech firm Klarna - seen as the bellwether of the industry - laid off 10% of its staff last month. read more

Affirm, however, said on Tuesday it was confident about its long-term prospects.

""Even as more players join the movement we started, the prize remains massive, and Affirm is well-positioned to win,"" a company spokesperson said.

180,312,APPLE,2022-06-07,Analysis: Apple's next frontier is your car's dashboard,"













June 7 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) wants to power the dashboard of your next car, but first it must convince automakers they will not end up surrendering future profits to the iPhone company like the makers of flip-phone handsets.

Apple on Monday gave a preview of a new generation of its CarPlay software that will migrate from its current home on the entertainment screen to power everything in front of the driver. read more

While the move from one screen to another may seem like a small step for Apple, it's a huge leap in terms of both the technological and business engagement between the iPhone maker and the world's automakers.

Electric vehicle leader Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) has proven the popularity of a large in-vehicle screen and fully integrated software with consumers. Carmakers are pushing to control the relationship with consumers in the more software-dominated car as a way to generate more profits.

The current version of Apple CarPlay, available in 98% of new cars in the United States, is fundamentally limited in its capabilities.

CarPlay apps live on the entertainment screens of vehicles and can play music or podcasts after a user has connected their iPhone to the car. But the software cannot control even basic functions of a vehicle like changing climate control settings.

Presenters at Apple's developer conference Monday showed a slide with the logos of more than a dozen automotive brands, including Ford (F.N), Mercedes, Audi and Porsche. Apple says the carmakers are ""excited"" about the concept of dashboard displays that offer a more consistent Apple look and feel.

To do so, iPhones will communicate with a vehicle's real-time driving systems for the first time - a critical step toward Apple potentially powering autonomous driving functions in the future.

Representatives of some of those brands described their companies as interested but said no decisions have been made yet for future models.

""We are working with Apple on this development project,"" a Porsche spokesperson said.

AUTOMAKERS ARE THE GATEKEEPERS

Automakers are wary of Apple and other tech giants. They saw how phone makers such as Motorola (MSI.N) and Nokia (NOKIA.HE) and the one-time powers of the music industry shriveled as iPhones and Android smartphones consumed those businesses.

""There's no question this is a threat because the automakers, particularly as we transition to software-defined vehicles, realize they run a significant risk of losing whatever ability they have to interact with the consumer unless they get their act together,"" said Evangelos Simoudis, a Silicon Valley venture capital investor and adviser who closely follows connected vehicle technology.

At the same time, big automakers know their current entertainment systems are a persistent cause of consumer complaints to quality scorekeepers at J.D. Power and Associates and other market research firms.

In China, younger consumers are turning their backs on established brands in part because their connectivity doesn't match what Tesla or China's own technology-industry bred electric vehicle startups offer. read more

The next generation of vehicles from major automakers will have sprawling dashboard screens. Mercedes-Benz, for example, has shown a prototype Vision EQXX electric sedan with a display screen that is 47.5 inches (121 cm) wide, and would offer functions such as an ""efficiency assistant"" that would calculate the most fuel-efficient route for a journey.

The competition now is over who will develop the software to power such displays, who will control the data flowing from the vehicle and the customers on board, and who will get to generate revenue as vehicles roll down the road.

Automakers do have one advantage over former phone handset makers: They are the gatekeepers for the critical electronic systems of vehicles, which are subject to extensive government safety regulation and hardware durability requirements that are far more stringent than those of the smartphone industry.

There are signs that automakers and technology industry companies are coming to terms. Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google has agreements with General Motors Co (GM.N), Volvo Cars and the Renault-Nissan Alliance (RENA.PA) to provide software for the next generation of systems. Amazon.com (AMZN.O) has cut deals with automakers to integrate its Alexa voice assistant in vehicles.

At Apple, Emily Schubert, an engineering manager for car experience, said during Monday's conference that using the new software, ""your iPhone communicates with your vehicle's real-time systems in an on-device, privacy friendly way, showing all of your driving information.""

The software also provides hints at Apple's future in autonomous driving.

While Reuters has previously reported that Apple could release its own electric vehicle with autonomous feature as early as 2024 or 2025, moving its software to instrument clusters puts the iPhone maker closer to the key vehicle systems and controls Apple would need to access to provide autonomous driving software to other companies. read more

""Cars have changed a lot, with larger-sized screens and more of them throughout the car,"" Schubert said during the keynote. ""There's an opportunity for iPhone to play an even more important role.""

Apple announced the software far ahead of its release to the public, saying cars using it will not be announced until late next year. Apple appears to be giving automakers plenty of time to customize the new CarPlay software, an acknowledgment that the final look of the software could be different for Fords and Ferraris.

181,454,APPLE,2022-06-07,"Sony's former chief, who pushed content but missed iPod wave, dies at 84","













TOKYO, June 7 (Reuters) - Nobuyuki Idei, the urbane former chief executive of Sony Group Corp (6758.T), who spearheaded the Japanese conglomerate's push into content but missed the shift to MP3s that led to the iPod, died on June 2, the company said on Tuesday.

Idei, who was 84, took the helm in 1995 to drive Sony into entertainment from hardware, but under his leadership the company behind the Walkman was slow to embrace MP3s and flat-panel TVs.

Known for his charisma and frank manner, Idei had been handpicked by predecessor Norio Ohga but his push into content opened a rift between Japan-based engineers and foreign movie and music executives.

""When I was in charge of Sony, I was criticised for saying we shouldn't make panels,"" Idei told Reuters in 2012.

""But when Toyota builds cars it buys the steel from Nippon Steel. The value is in the car, not the steel.""

Under Idei, Sony ceded its lead in the portable music industry it had created to Apple, with the company also outmanoeuvered by domestic rivals and Korean companies in televisions.

In 2000, Sony's valuation was seven times that of Apple and Ohga had considered a takeover of the California-based firm during the early 1990s, Reuters has reported.

Idei stepped down in 2005 to take responsibility for slumping earnings and was replaced by Britain-born Howard Stringer, who became the first foreigner to lead the company.

The drive away from fabrication accelerated after Idei's tenure as Sony sold off loss-making hardware operations to focus on entertainment, such as the PlayStation games business.

""The prescience and foresight with which (he) predicted the impact of the internet, and engaged proactively with digitalisation across Sony, amazes me to this day,"" Sony's chief executive, Kenichiro Yoshida, said in a statement.

Idei died of liver failure. After his departure from Sony,he had continued to play a role in corporate Japan as an adviser and director on company boards.

June 7 (Reuters) - Shareholders of Shopify Inc on Tuesday voted in favor of protecting Chief Executive Officer Tobias Lutke's 40% voting stake, a source told Reuters, citing preliminary results from the e-commerce firm's annual shareholder meeting.

The company, which in May reported its slowest quarterly revenue growth since going public in 2015, will also carry out a 10-for-one split of the company's class A and class B shares after investors voted for it, the person familiar with the matter said.

Shopify announced the stock split in April, joining a growing list of companies that have split their shares to make them more attractive for investors. read more

Other stock split announcements this year came from e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O). Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) also had said it would seek shareholder approval for a stock split. read more

June 8 (Reuters) - Twitter (TWTR.N) users will be able to receive reminders when retailers release limited edition items for sale, through a new feature the social media company announced on Wednesday.

Twitter will test the feature with brands including Dior, Home Depot and Fossil.

Luxury designers, streetwear brands and other retailers have created a trend in recent years of releasing small collections of clothes and accessories that can often sell out within minutes and generate hype among shoppers.

The new feature from Twitter is intended to play off the platform's reputation as a place for real-time information and news.

""It's directly inspired by the vibrant conversation about product launches on our service – from new gaming consoles and new handbags to the latest limited edition sneaker,"" said Justin Hoang, staff product manager at Twitter, in a statement.

When brands tweet about an upcoming product launch, users can tap a ""Remind me"" button on the tweet. Shoppers will receive an app notification 15 minutes before the item goes on sale and a second notification when it is on sale.

The feature is only available for users in the United States using Apple devices to start.

It comes as Twitter's deal to be acquired by billionaire Elon Musk remains uncertain. The Tesla CEO in a filing on Monday threatened to walk away from the deal if he did not receive access to certain data. read more

June 8 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday dismissed a proposed class-action lawsuit accusing Apple Inc (AAPL.O) of defrauding customers by selling iPhones and iPads whose processors proved vulnerable to two cybersecurity flaws first disclosed in 2018.

U.S. District Judge Edward Davila in San Jose, California said customers failed to prove that they overpaid for their devices because Apple knowingly concealed defects, and provided security patches that made its devices significantly slower.

The lawsuit was filed after Apple and other companies including Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google revealed the Meltdown and Spectre flaws, which could let hackers access computer devices and steal their memory contents, in January 2018.

Apple customers claimed that the Cupertino, California-based company learned about the defects in June 2017, but said nothing until after the New York Times reported on the flaws.

Davila, however, said the customers did not show they relied on Apple's marketing, and that the company's assertions that its products were ""secure"" and built ""with your privacy in mind"" were too general to support their claims.

The judge also said it was not false or misleading for Apple to claim that its newer processors were faster and lasted longer than older processors, just because the patches may have degraded performance.

""Plaintiffs have failed to allege an affirmative misrepresentation, an actionable omission, and actual reliance"" on misstatements by Apple, Davila wrote.

Lawyers for the plaintiff customers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Davila said they can try to replead their claims by June 30.

Meltdown affected only chips from Intel Corp (INTC.O), while Spectre affected nearly all chips made in the prior decade.

In seeking a dismissal, Apple said similar lawsuits had previously been dismissed against other manufacturers including Intel and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O).

The case is In re Apple Processor Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-00147.

186,887,APPLE,2022-06-08,Baidu's electric vehicle firm Jidu unveils first 'robot' car,"













BEIJING, June 8 (Reuters) - Baidu's electric vehicle (EV) arm Jidu Auto on Wednesday launched a ""robot"" concept car, the first vehicle to be revealed by a Chinese internet company.

The concept car, which is free of door handles and can be fully controlled via voice recognition, was launched through an online press conference held on Baidu's metaverse-themed app Xirang.

Jidu, an EV venture controlled by Baidu and co-funded by Chinese automaker Geely, plans to mass produce the model, which would be 90% similar to the concept car, in 2023.

The 'robot' EVs will possess autonomous Level 4 capabilities that need no human intervention as well as utilize Qualcomm's (QCOM.O) 8295 chips, which will enable users to access voice assistance offline when internet connection is poor.

Baidu's EV-making plan comes as tech companies around the world race to develop smart cars after Tesla's (TSLA.O) success in commercializing electric vehicles.

Besides equipping the vehicle with autonomous driving software technology powered by Baidu, Jidu will also build two lidars and 12 cameras alongside the car. Lidars are detection systems, similar to radars, which use pulsed laser light rather than radio waves.

""The Jidu robocar aims to meet users' needs for intelligent travel ... and intelligent cabin in the new era,"" said Joe Xia Yiping, Jidu chief executive, adding ""the ultimate goal is to realize a fully driverless transportation experience.""

Jidu cars will target users who like cutting-edge technologies, Luo Gang, head of operations at Jidu, told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.

The EVs will be manufactured in Hangzhou Bay in China's eastern city of Ningbo, where Geely has several plants.

Jidu has hired ex-Cadillac designer Frank Wu as its head of design, and Wang Weibao, a former member of Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) EV initiative Project Titan, as its head of intelligent driving.

Jidu's first model will be priced above 200,000 yuan ($29,914.59), Baidu chief executive Robin Li said on a conference call last month.

Smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp (1810.HK) and Didi Global are among other Chinese tech giants who are pursuing auto-making ambitions.

187,446,APPLE,2022-06-08,Intel freezes hiring in PC chip division for at least two weeks,"













June 8 (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) has frozen hiring in the division responsible for PC desktop and laptop chips, according to a memo reviewed by Reuters, as part of a series of cost-cutting measures.

Intel is ""pausing all hiring and placing all job requisitions on hold"" in its client computing group, according to the memo sent on Wednesday. The memo said that some hiring could resume in as little as two weeks after the division re-evaluates priorities and that all current job offers in its systems will be honored.

""We believe we are at the beginning of a long-term growth cycle across the semiconductor industry and we have the right strategy in place,"" Intel said in a statement. ""Increased focus and prioritization in our spending will help us weather macroeconomic uncertainty, execute on our strategy and meet our commitments to customers, shareholders, and employees.""

Intel shares are down nearly 28% over the past year and the company has told investors to brace for lower gross margins than it has historically earned as it spends heavily to catch up to rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW) whose manufacturing technology has overtaken Intel's.

The company's client computing group is its largest by sales, generating $9.3 billion of its $18.4 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter. Once dominant, Intel's desktop and laptop chips face increased competition from Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O), and the division lost Apple Inc (AAPL.O) as a customer after Apple started using it own custom-designed chips.

The memo sent Wednesday also outlined other cost-cutting measures such as cancelling some travel for the group immediately, limiting participation in industry conferences and instructions to hold group meetings virtually when possible.

The hiring freeze does not appear to affect all of Intel. In a memo sent to all employees on Tuesday, Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said the company would ""slow"" its hiring and would onboard 23,000 recently hired employees over the next 90 days. Intel had 121,000 employees at the end of 2021.

189,46,APPLE,2022-06-08,Apple to fund pay-later loans off its own balance sheet,"













June 8 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) plans to fund loans for its forthcoming Apple Pay Later service off its corporate balance sheet, the company said on Wednesday.

Apple said its treasury department will decide the exact mechanism it will use to fund the loans and funding sources may shift over time. Loans and creditworthiness decisions will be handled by a wholly owned subsidiary, Apple Financing LLC.

Apple announced the pay-later service this week, offering to split purchases up into four equal payments over six weeks. The service will launch later this year along with Apple's latest operating systems for iPhones and iPads and will put it into competition with existing buy-now, pay-later firms such as Affirm Holdings Inc (AFRM.O) and Block Inc's (SQ.N) Afterpay.

Apple's pay-later loans will have zero interest and no fees of any kind. To judge creditworthiness, Apple said it plans to use a soft pull of a customer's credit and other data, such as the customer's purchase and payment history with Apple in both its stores and online services such as the App Store.

To use the pay-later service, Apple customers will have to connect a debit card to their Apple Pay account to fund repayment of the loans. A quarter of the purchase price for approved loans will be due at the time of purchase, and, like other debit card transactions, Apple will run an instant check to ensure there are sufficient funds to cover the upfront payment.

Apple will offer the loans anywhere that Apple Pay is accepted, both online and in physical retail stores. The payments to merchants will be made over the MasterCard (MA.N) network through a payment credential issued by Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Apple said.

Apple Financing LLC has lending licenses in all U.S. states where such pay-later services are allowed, it added.

190,628,APPLE,2022-06-08,Russia's Sberbank to close gaming unit as restrictions bite,"













June 8 (Reuters) - Russia's dominant lender Sberbank (SBER.MM) on Wednesday said it would close its gaming unit, SberGames, due to external restrictions on Russian developers, as Western sanctions force the company to scale back in areas beyond banking.

Sberbank has been developing its non-financial businesses such as e-commerce, technology and cloud services in an attempt to combat shrinking margins, and although it maintains a presence in several other sectors, its gaming efforts will fall by the wayside.

""Due to external restrictions for Russian developers on the global market, Sber has taken the decision to close its gaming business,"" Sberbank said in a statement.

The Kommersant daily in early May cited a source as saying that SberGames may have to close as it faced difficulties in distributing its games since Apple (AAPL.O) and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google limited access to their application stores.

""SberGames is stopping hiring new employees and launching new projects,"" Sberbank said. ""It is planned that some SberGames employees will move to work in other departments of the bank and the company's ecosystem.""

Sberbank, hit with blocking sanctions by the United States and United Kingdom and losing access to the SWIFT global payments system, has exited most of its European markets and been forced to make some dollar-denominated debt repayments in roubles as the West targets Russia's key institutions over Moscow's actions in Ukraine.

WASHINGTON, June 8 (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar and lawmakers from both parties said on Wednesday they had the Senate votes needed to pass legislation aimed at reining in the four tech giants, Meta's Facebook (FB.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google and Amazon.com (AMZN.O), and urged a vote be taken.

Versions of the bill before the House and Senate would bar the companies from favoring their own businesses in search results and other ways.

""We wouldn't be asking for a vote if we didn't think we could get 60 votes,"" said Klobuchar, who was flanked by Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican who backs the bill, and House sponsors Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat, and Ken Buck, a Republican.

In the Senate, bills generally need support from 60 senators to cut off debate and move to a vote on final passage.

Amazon.com, the Chamber of Commerce and others took aim at the proposal last week. read more

The Senate is expected to vote on the bill this summer, perhaps as early as late June, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The House is then expected to vote on the Senate version, sources said.

""This bill has to pass in June,"" said Buck. Grassley said: ""We need a Senate vote. And we need that Senate vote to be soon.""

The tech giants have said the bill would imperil popular consumer products like Google Maps and Amazon Basics and make it harder for the companies to protect their users' security and privacy.

Cicilline, who said he expected a House vote ""very soon,"" disagreed with the companies' criticism of it.

""This bill will not prevent Amazon from providing free shipping or other services to its Prime members. But it will prohibit Amazon from misleading customers by rigging search results and cheating its sellers by stealing their nonpublic product information,"" he said.

June 9 (Reuters) - China's market share in the Russian smartphone market jumped significantly in May as manufacturers like Apple and Samsung (005930.KS) paused new sales in Russia and Western sanctions weighed on the Russian economy.

Chinese manufacturers Xiaomi (1810.HK), Realme and Honor accounted for 42% of Russia's smartphone sales in May 2022, according to data from mobile network MTS shared with Reuters, - up from 28% during the same month last year.

South Korea's Samsung lost its spot as the market leader, with 14% of devices sold versus 28% last year, and Apple's share dropped to 9% from 12%.

Overall smartphone sales were down 26% year-on-year, MTS said, as Western sanctions and supply chain disruptions have severely hit Russia's consumer economy.

Apple and Samsung stopped new product sales in Russia after Moscow sent its army into Ukraine in late February, but retailers have been able to use up existing stocks.

The Kremlin has also moved to allow Russian companies to ship in some products, including smartphones, without the license holder's permission in a so-called ""parallel imports"" scheme.

193,479,APPLE,2022-06-09,Biden administration scraps policy on tech-standard patents,"Summary Supporters of policy said it would promote competition

Detractors said it would weaken patent rights, incentives to innovate















(Reuters) - The Biden administration said Wednesday that it would end Trump-era policy guidance aimed at strengthening patents that cover industry standards for important technologies, but also withdrew its own proposed policy for making such patents less restrictive.

The policy adopted under the Trump administration encouraged courts to issue injunctions like sales bans for violations of so-called standard-essential patents in certain cases. Supporters of the 2019 policy said it enhanced patent rights and incentivized innovation.

Supporters of U.S. President Joe Biden's proposed policy, which discouraged injunctions, said such bans can inflate royalties and stifle competition.

Standard-essential patents cover technology that devices must include to comply with international standards like 4G, Wi-Fi, and USB. Some standards have thousands of essential patents, and their owners are required to offer licenses on fair and reasonable terms.

In a joint statement by the U.S. Department of Justice, Patent and Trademark Office, and National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Biden Administration said Wednesday that withdrawing the 2019 policy was ""the best course of action for promoting both competition and innovation.""

The statement said DOJ would assess issues related to standard-essential patents on a ""case-by-case basis.""

Biden's proposed revisions to the 2019 policy, announced in December, attracted over 150 public comments.

Democratic Senators Chris Coons and Mazie Hirono and Republican Senator Thom Tillis said in a joint statement in February that the revised policy would ""embolden strategic infringers,"" ""disincentivize U.S. research and development,"" and weaken the United States' ability to compete with countries like China that are ""actively seeking to dominate the next generation of technological standards.""

Tech companies like Apple, Amazon, Sony and Verizon supported the proposed revisions. Apple said in February that the proposal was a ""return to a balanced policy focused on ensuring fair competition, advancing innovation, and promoting U.S. competitiveness internationally.""

Amazon also said in response to the proposal that the 2019 policy on injunctions ""badly distorts licensing negotiations"" and ""promotes needless litigation.""

194,0,APPLE,2022-06-09,Apple pay-later foray blurs tech-finance boundary,"













LONDON, June 9 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tim Cook has crossed the banking divide. Big U.S. tech firms have so far largely kept out of the lending business. But on Monday Apple’s (AAPL.O) chief executive unveiled plans to use the $2.4 trillion company’s balance sheet to offer “buy now, pay later” loans to iPhone users. The push into financial services will keep traditional banks on their toes.

Apple has played around the fringes of finance for some time. Its Apple Pay service allows customers to use their devices to make swift payments. And in 2019 the company launched a credit card with much fanfare. The key difference this time, however, is that its Apple Financing subsidiary is making the lending decisions and will fund the loans with the backing of its parent company’s balance sheet, which included $193 billion of cash and securities at the end of March. Goldman Sachs (GS.N), the lender behind Apple’s credit card, will in this case serve as the bank sponsor that allows Apple to access the Mastercard (MA.N) payments network.

Keeping the loans in-house should enable Apple to earn better margins. A typical pay-later transaction charges the retailer a fee of at least 4%. Jefferies analysts reckon Afterpay, now owned by payments firm Block (SQ.N), keeps about half of that after deducting credit card transaction fees, borrowing costs and loans that customers fail to repay. But Apple probably has lower borrowing costs than its rivals. Rising interest rates are squeezing pay-later providers such as Affirm (AFRM.O) and Klarna, which rely on wholesale credit and bank deposits. Meanwhile, data about users’ spending on its products may give Apple an edge when assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers, limiting future losses. Acting as the lender will allow it to keep a bigger chunk of the transaction fees.

Chinese tech firms like Ant, an offshoot of e-commerce giant Alibaba (9988.HK), have long mined user data to make loans. Fear of regulation, and the humdrum returns earned by most banks, have largely kept big U.S. tech firms out of the lending business. Even a successful foray into pay-later credit will barely register compared with fast-growing revenue streams like advertising, which research outfit Omdia estimates brought in $3.7 billion for Apple last year. However, Cook’s decision to step decisively across the tech-finance boundary will have big banks watching with interest – and some trepidation.

195,499,APPLE,2022-06-10,Co-producer Hamilton says he will not appear in Brad Pitt F1 film,"













BAKU, June 10 (Reuters) - Seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton on Friday said he would not appear in a film starring Brad Pitt based on Formula One that the Mercedes racer is co-producing as he does not want it to flop.

Apple TV earlier this week said its studio arm had landed the rights to the feature which will be directed by Joseph Kosinski, director of newly-released blockbuster 'Top Gun: Maverick'.

It said Kosinski would also produce the movie along with Hamilton, Plan B Entertainment, Jerry Bruckheimer and Chad Oman.

""It’s a really cool project,"" Hamilton told reporters at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix on Friday.

""We’re already working on the script for example ... which is fun, spending good time with Brad which is pretty epic,"" added the 37-year-old.

Hamilton, the most successful driver in Formula One history, has varied interests outside the sport, including fashion and music and he has even featured in a Christina Aguilera song.

He is also a keen campaigner for human rights, social justice, equality and the environment.

Hamilton, who is currently involved in the making of a documentary about him, said he saw his role as ensuring diversity among the cast and crew.

He also wanted the movie, which Apple TV said would feature Pitt as a driver who comes out of retirement to compete alongside a rookie against the titans of the sport, to capture the essence of Formula One.

""I don’t plan to be in it, no,"" said Hamilton.

""Really my responsibility and something that I take on is just making sure that the cast and the crew in the background is diverse.

""It's really about showing how great this sport really is to people that maybe have never watched it but also making sure that we really keep the real heritage and the true racing spirit in the movie.""

He didn't rule out inviting fellow drivers to be a part of it.

""There’s lots of people within the sport who are being a part of this, helping educate those who are trying to create this movie,"" said Hamilton.

""There’s talk of already how we’re going to capture some of the footage.

""It’s going to take us drivers to be involved in that.

""But we’re not actors ... we don’t want this movie to be crap, which is probably why I’m not going to be part of it also.""

June 10 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Friday laid out how developers of dating apps offered in the Netherlands can skip Apple's in-app payment systems, a closely watched step by the iPhone maker in the face of global antitrust concerns about its control over the mobile app industry.

Apple has long mandated use of its in-app payment system, which charges commissions of up 30% that some developers like Tinder owner Match Group Inc (MTCH.O) have argued are too high. The Dutch Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) last year ruled that Apple's rules violated Dutch competition laws in the dating app market and required Apple to allow those developers to use third-party payment processors.

Investors are watching the developments in the Dutch antitrust case for the impact they could have on Apple's App Store revenues, the biggest component of its $68.4 billion services business.

Under the rules, Apple said dating app developers will still have to pay it commissions for sales made outside of its in-app payment system, though it will give them a slight discount. Apple had previously said developers who were paying its 30% commission rate would owe it a 27% commission.

But some developers already pay Apple a lower 15% commission rate when they meet certain criteria such as retaining subscription customers for more than a year.

Apple's previous rules did not make clear whether those developers would also get a discount when using third-party payment services. Apple on Friday said those developers will pay a 12% commission when using outside payment systems.

Apple on Friday also said that Dutch authorities mandated changes to how apps look when using third-party payments.

Apple's system will show users a warning that says the user will have to contact the developer over payment problems such as asking for a refund. Apple had originally included a button that would allow users to back out of using the third-party payment option after being shown the warning, but the iPhone maker said Friday that Dutch authorities had rejected that button.

""We don’t believe some of these changes are in the best interests of our users’ privacy or data security,"" Apple said in a news post. ""As we’ve previously said, we disagree with the ACM’s original order and are appealing it.""

197,98,APPLE,2022-06-10,"UK plans to probe Apple, Google's mobile browser dominance","













LONDON, June 10 (Reuters) - Britain's competition watchdog said it was planning to investigate the market dominance of Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Google's mobile browsers, as well as the iPhone maker's restrictions on cloud gaming through its app store.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Friday it was also taking enforcement action against Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google over its app store payment practices.

It said the two tech giants had an ""effective duopoly"" on mobile ecosystems that gave them a stranglehold on operating systems, app stores and web browsers on mobile devices.

""When it comes to how people use mobile phones, Apple and Google hold all the cards,"" CMA Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli said following the publication of a report on mobile ecosytems.

""As good as many of their services and products are, their strong grip on mobile ecosystems allows them to shut out competitors, holding back the British tech sector and limiting choice.""

It said 97% of all mobile web browsing in Britain last year was powered by either Apple's or Google's browser engine, and in addition Apple banned alternatives to its own browser on iPhone.

The CMA said it was concerned this severely limited the potential for rival browsers to differentiate themselves from Apple's Safari, for example on features such as speed and functionality.

Apple said in a statement it had ""created a safe and trusted experience users love and a great business opportunity for developers"" through its ecosystem.

""We respectfully disagree with a number of conclusions reached in the report, which discount our investments in innovation, privacy and user performance — all of which contribute to why users love iPhone and iPad and create a level playing field for small developers to compete on a trusted platform,"" a spokesperson said.

""We will continue to engage constructively with the CMA to explain how our approach promotes competition and choice, while ensuring consumers’ privacy and security are always protected.""

Google said smartphones using its Android operating system offered people and businesses more choice than any other mobile platform, and its Google Play app store has been the launchpad for millions of apps.

""We regularly review how we can best support developers and have reacted quickly to CMA feedback in the past,"" a Google spokesperson said.

""We will review the report and continue to engage with the CMA.""

The regulator said it was also worried about Apple blocking the emergence of cloud gaming services, which allow high-quality games to be streamed rather than individually downloaded.

""By preventing this sector from growing, Apple risks causing mobile users to miss out on the full benefits of cloud gaming,"" it said.

The CMA said its proposed investigation would further assess its concerns and could result in legally binding orders requiring changes to be made to Apple's and Google's practices.

The consultation on the proposed the market investigation reference will close on 22 July.

198,178,APPLE,2022-06-13,Rune Labs gets FDA clearance to use Apple Watch to track Parkinson's symptoms,"













June 13 (Reuters) - San Francisco-based startup Rune Labs on Monday said it received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to use the Apple Watch to monitor tremors and other common symptoms in patients with Parkinson’s disease.

The Rune Labs software uses motion sensors built into the Apple Watch, which can already be used to detect when a person falls. Rune Labs Chief Executive Brian Pepin said in an interview that Apple Watch data will be combined with data from other sources, including a Medtronic Inc (MDT.N) implant that can measure brain signals.

Rune Labs' goal is for doctors to use the combined data to decide whether and how to fine-tune the patients' treatment. At present, Pepin said, most doctors have to gather data on a patient's movements by observing them during a short clinical visit, which is not ideal because Parkinson's symptoms can vary widely over time.

Using the Apple Watch, Rune Labs' StrivePD software platform will provide doctors a continuous stream of observations over long stretches, Pepin said.

""When you think about the process of getting someone to their optimal therapy or combination of drugs or devices, or even whether or not a patient might be a good fit for a certain clinical trial, it's a very hard decision to make when you only have a little context,"" Pepin said.

The Rune Labs FDA clearance is the first prominent use of software tools that Apple released for measuring movement disorders in 2018.

Last year, a group of scientists at Apple published a study in the journal Science Translational Medicine showing the device was effective at monitoring Parkinson's symptoms. After contacting Apple about the tools, Pepin said, ""it took about eight minutes for the team lead to get back to me and say, 'Hey, perfect, let's explore this.'""

Apple has partnered with a range of other companies to use the Apple Watch as a health monitoring device, including a deal with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) to study whether it can be used to help lower stroke risk.

199,244,APPLE,2022-06-13,"Apple music, gaming to bring in over $8 billion in revenue by 2025, J.P. Morgan says","













June 13 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) revenue from gaming and music offerings is expected to jump 36% to $8.2 billion by 2025, J.P.Morgan said on Monday, as the iPhone maker taps its huge user base to drive its subscription services.

The two services are likely to have a combined subscriber base of about 180 million by 2025 - 110 million for music and 70 million for gaming - boosted by the rapid spread of the internet and a booming gaming industry, according to JPM analysts, led by Samik Chatterjee.

Apple Music, which was launched in 2015 and is the second-biggest music-streaming service after Spotify Technology (SPOT.N), is expected to account for a bigger chunk of that revenue, raking in about $7 billion by 2025, the brokerage said.

Apple Arcade, the gaming subscription service launched in 2019, is estimated to pull in $1.2 billion.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The company does not give a sales breakup for gaming and music services but the overall segment, which includes App Store, Apple TV+, Arcade and Apple Music, reported revenue of $19.82 billion for the March quarter. The business is seen as Apple's engine for expansion.

Chatterjee, who is rated five stars for his estimate accuracy on Apple by Refinitiv Eikon, expects the gaming-market size to hit $360 billion by 2028 and music streaming to reach $55 billion by 2025.

200,766,APPLE,2022-06-13,U.S. bill to rein in Big Tech backed by dozens of small and big companies,"













WASHINGTON, June 13 (Reuters) - Dozens of companies and business organizations sent a letter to U.S. Congress members on Monday, urging them to support a bill that would rein in the biggest tech companies such as Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google.

Last week, Democratic U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar and lawmakers from both parties said they had the Senate votes needed to pass legislation that would prevent tech platforms, including Apple (AAPL.O) and Facebook , from favoring their own businesses.

Companies supporting the measure, which include Yelp, Sonos, DuckDuckGo and Spotify, called it a ""moderate and sensible bill aimed squarely at well-documented abuses by the very largest online platforms.""

Other signatories included the American Booksellers Association, the American Independent Business Alliance, the Institute for Local Self-Reliance and Kelkoo Group. Amazon.com, the Chamber of Commerce and others oppose the measure. read more

Supporters urged lawmakers to pass the bill, saying it would modernize antitrust laws so smaller companies can compete.

Last week, Klobuchar said she believed she had the 60 Senate votes needed to end debate and move to a vote on final passage. There is a similar bill in the House of Representatives.

""It's no surprise that Yelp and Spotify like the bill since it's designed to help them. But senators are telling us that they just aren't hearing their voters demanding changes to Amazon Basics and Google Maps,"" the pro-tech Chamber of Progress said in a statement.

The tech giants have said the bill would imperil popular consumer products like Google Maps and Amazon Basics and make it harder for the companies to protect their users' security and privacy.

Carl Szabo of NetChoice said the pressure being exerted to get a vote on the bill was a sign that it did not have enough support to pass. ""This is a drowning bill's last gasp for air,"" he said.

201,387,APPLE,2022-06-14,Adobe revamps metaverse design tools for Apple's chips,"













June 14 (Reuters) - Adobe Inc (ADBE.O) on Tuesday said it has reworked several of its tools for creating three-dimensional content to make them work well on Apple Inc (AAPL.O) computers that use the iPhone maker's proprietary ""M"" series chips.

Adobe has long been a major player providing software in creative fields like photography, graphic design and film. But Adobe has been working to build out more tools for making the three-dimensional worlds and objects used in video games and, increasingly, the so-called metaverse, where companies like Meta Platforms Inc are hoping to use augmented reality technology to overlay digital content on the real world.

Adobe acquired software tools called Substance 3D in 2019 when it bought French firm Allegorithmic for an undisclosed sum. The tool helps the makers of movies like ""Frozen 2"" and games imbue the digital objects they create with a wide array of lifelike textures, like wood or leather.

Adobe said that it has reworked the software so that it will run on Apple's proprietary chips, a move that is likely to help Apple gain some ground of its own. While Apple's laptops and desktop are widely used in some creative fields like music production, game developers tend to still rely on PCs that can be paired with power graphics chips from Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) that help graphics look more realistic.

But Apple's new chips have added new graphics processing power, and Adobe plans to take full advantage of it in the new software, said Francois Cottin, senior director of marketing at Adobe.

""For these kinds of use cases, vertical integration is really key, from the app all the way to the chip,"" Cottin said. ""We've been working very closely with Apple on future-looking use cases. I think Substance 3D definitely represent that.""

Adobe also said Tuesday that it had signed up new customers for its three-dimensional content creation tools, including German fashion brand Hugo Boss and outdoor footwear brand Salomon Group.

202,701,APPLE,2022-06-14,Warren Buffett donates $4 billion to charity,"













June 14 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Tuesday donated about $4 billion to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust and four family charities, part of the billionaire's pledge to give away nearly all of his net worth.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), which Buffett has run since 1965, said the donation comprises about 14.4 million of its Class B shares, whose closing price on Tuesday was $277.64.

Eleven million shares will go to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and 1.1 million will go to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for Buffett's late first wife.

Another 770,000 shares will also go to each of three charities run by Buffett's children Howard, Susan and Peter: the Howard G. Buffett Foundation, the Sherwood Foundation and the Novo Foundation.

Since 2006, the 91-year-old Buffett has donated more than half of his Berkshire shares, with the donations worth about $45.5 billion at the time they were made.

Despite the donations, Buffett still owns approximately 16% of Berkshire and controls about one-third of its voting power.

Both percentages have been fairly stable in recent years because Berkshire has aggressively repurchased its own stock.

Buffett has built Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire into a more than $600 billion conglomerate, owning dozens of businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Geico auto insurance, and stocks such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N).

He and Bill Gates also pioneered ""The Giving Pledge,"" where more than 200 people like Michael Bloomberg, Larry Ellison, Carl Icahn, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg committed at least half their fortunes to philanthropy.

WASHINGTON, June 14 (Reuters) - A top Democratic lawmaker on antitrust issues said Tuesday a bill aimed at reining in the market power of Big Tech platforms like Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google had the votes to pass the both chambers of Congress in the next few weeks.

On the sidelines of an event to rally support for measures before the Senate and House of Representatives that would prevent tech platforms, including Apple (AAPL.O) and Facebook , from favoring their own businesses in search and other ways, Representative David Cicilline, chair of the House antitrust subcommittee, said: ""I'm very confident when these bills come to the floor, they will pass. Convincingly.""

Asked when, he said: ""Before we leave for the summer, my hope is that it will happen. Obviously, best case scenario would be in the next week. Worst case scenario in my view, the month of July.""

U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, chair of a Senate antitrust panel, also said last week that she enough support in the Senate to win passage.

Representative Ken Buck, a Republican sponsor, said Tuesday he supported the bill at least partially because of his view that conservative views are stifled online. ""We're being discriminated against,"" he said.

The bills have been the subject of a ferocious amount of lobbying, with tech giants warning of dire consequences, like the disappearance of popular consumer online applications like Google Maps. Cicilline called some of those allegations ""lies"" on Tuesday.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce opposes the bills, and said on Tuesday: ""The legislation would empower government bureaucracy to reign over our economy. No longer would competition be evaluated on the merits, instead the interest of consumers would be sidelined in favor of the interest of competitors.""

Dozens of companies and business organizations sent a letter to U.S. lawmakers Monday, urging them to support the measures. L1N2Y01EC Companies supporting the measure include Yelp, Sonos, DuckDuckGo and Spotify.

Law firms Related documents Apple calls subpoena 'boundless,' asks court to seal any hearing

Plaintiffs seeking internal Apple records amid long-running case challenging NFL, DirecTV distribution of games















(Reuters) - Apple Inc is fighting to shield its commercial information in a dustup in California federal court, as plaintiffs' lawyers seek to pry information from the company in their antitrust case involving the National Football League's ""Sunday Ticket"" programming package.

Apple, which isn't a defendant in the case, asked a U.S. federal judge to reject a ""boundless"" subpoena and also to seal any hearing the court might hold in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On Monday, the plaintiffs' lawyers fired back, saying Apple had not offered any compelling reason to keep the public out.

""Apple's broad and unsubstantiated allegations of harm are insufficient under the good cause standard,"" lawyers for the plaintiffs wrote in a filing.

Apple and its lawyers at Walker Stevens Cannom, including Hannah Cannom, on Tuesday did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

The plaintiffs' claims in 2015 challenged ""interlocking agreements"" among the NFL, its teams and DirecTV. The NFL and DirecTV's ""Sunday Ticket"" package allows fans to watch ""out-of-market"" football games that are not broadcast in their local television market.

The plaintiffs contend the agreements restrained the distribution of NFL telecasts and artificially drove up the price of the Sunday games package. The plaintiffs have said potential damages are in the billions of dollars.

In their demand for Apple information, the plaintiffs lawyers pointed to recent news stories that said Apple was part of the bidding for ""Sunday Ticket,"" which is in its last year on DirecTV.

""Apple is not a party to this litigation, and the parties' claims and defenses have nothing to do with Apple or its business practices,"" attorney Cannom told the court.

The plaintiffs' attorneys, who did not respond to messages seeking comment, told the court they ""can no longer wait for Apple to voluntarily comply with the subpoena.""

Court papers in the subpoena fight were heavily redacted, shielding information from the public about the full scope of what the plaintiffs want to review. The plaintiffs' lawyers said in filings that a ""protective order"" would shield against disclosure of any confidential commercial information from Apple.

Apple said in its filings that it has ""worked diligently to try to reach agreement with plaintiffs on a narrowed scope of the subpoena.""

Trial in the underlying case is scheduled for February 2024.

The case is In re: National Football League's ""Sunday Ticket"" antitrust litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 3:22-mc-80140-DMR

BERLIN, June 14 (Reuters) - Germany's cartel office is looking into Apple's (AAPL.O) rules on tracking for third-party apps to see whether they give the U.S. tech giant preferential treatment or hinder other companies, it said on Tuesday.

""We welcome data-friendly business models that give users choices about how their data is used,"" said cartel office president Andreas Mundt. ""However, a company like Apple, which can unilaterally set the rules in its ecosystem and especially in the App Store, should make them in line with competition.""

In question is Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework, which requires users to give additional consent to having their data collected through tracking on apps that are not from Apple, according to the cartel office.

Tracking allows apps to collect user data and can be used for advertising purposes, such as personalized advertising.

A spokesperson for Apple said the company would work constructively with the cartel office to resolve any issues and discuss its approach to tracking rules.

The spokesperson added that ATT does not stop companies from showing ads while also allowing users to control their privacy.

Under new regulations that came into force in 2021, the regulator can ban companies that have particular market weight from carrying out practices that harm market competition.

The office has meanwhile used the instrument to also open proceedings against Facebook, Amazon and Google. read more

JERUSALEM, June 15 (Reuters) - U.S. defence contractor L3Harris (LHX.N) is in talks to buy Israeli spyware firm NSO Group, U.S. and Israeli media reported, citing sources with knowledge of the deal.

The deal is yet to be finalised and needs to be approved by Israel, the U.S. and L3Harris’ board of directors, according to the joint report by Haaretz, The Washington Post and The Guardian, and confirms parts of a report published in Intelligence Online this week.

It noted that The White House is concerned that any deal with to buy the Israeli firm’s hacking tools would raise serious counterintelligence and security concerns.

NSO declined to comment on the reports.

The surveillance firm, which makes the Pegasus software, has been in the spotlight after revelations its tools had been used by governments and other agencies to spy on people’s cellphones. NSO has said its technology helps catch criminals.

NSO lost many of its existing customers when the U.S. Commerce Department in November banned the company.

The reports said that if approved, the deal could see NSO removed from the banned list – either directly, or by having its assets bought by L3Harris, which will only work with the United States and its allies.

In January, NSO had told Reuters it was in talks with a number of U.S. funds over ""various financial moves"", confirming media reports that it was discussing a sale of its assets.

Apple (AAPL.O) is among those to have sued NSO, saying it violated U.S. laws by breaking into the software installed on iPhones.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc , Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) have also criticised NSO or taken legal action.

STOCKHOLM, June 15 (Reuters) - The European smartphone market declined by 12% in the first quarter of the year, registering the lowest shipments in the period for nearly a decade, according to a report from Counterpoint Research.

The fall was a result of ongoing component shortages, COVID-19 related lockdowns in China, deteriorating economic conditions and the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war, the research firm said.

While market leader Samsung (005930.KS) saw shipments fall by 16% and Apple's (AAPL.O) declined 6%, Realme was the only top-five vendor to register an annual growth in shipments.

""Rising inflation levels across the region are impacting consumer spending, while Samsung and Apple, Russia's first and third ranked smartphone vendors, halted all shipments into Europe's largest market in early March 2022,"" said Jan Stryjak, Counterpoint Research's associate director.

The research firm expects annual growth in smartphone shipments in Europe to continue to decline for the next few quarters, especially in the second quarter.

209,504,APPLE,2022-06-15,Qualcomm wins fight against $1 bln EU antitrust fine,"













LUXEMBOURG, June 15 (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM.O) on Wednesday won its fight against a 997 million euro ($1.05 billion) fine imposed by EU antitrust regulators four years ago, dealing a major setback to EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager's crackdown on Big Tech.

The European Commission in its 2018 decision said Qualcomm paid billions of dollars to Apple (AAPL.O) from 2011 to 2016 to use only its chips in all its iPhones and iPads in order to block out rivals such as Intel Corp (INTC.O)

Qualcomm's fine is one of several imposed by Vestager on companies ranging from Alphabet unit Google (GOOGL.O) to banks and truckmakers over anti-competitive practices. Apple, Amazon and Facebook are being investigated.

The General Court, Europe's second-highest, annulled the EU finding and faulted the EU competition enforcer over the handling of the case.

""A number of procedural irregularities affected Qualcomm's rights of defence and invalidate the Commission's analysis of the conduct alleged against Qualcomm,"" judges said.

""The Commission did not provide an analysis which makes it possible to support the findings that the payments concerned had actually reduced Apple’s incentives to switch to Qualcomm's competitors in order to obtain supplies of LTE chipsets for certain iPad models to be launched in 2014 and 2015,"" they said.

The EU competition enforcer can appeal on matters of law to the EU Court of Justice (CJEU), Europe's highest court.

[1/2] A woman walks past a counter displaying mobile phones at the Qualcomm booth during the 2021 China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS) in Beijing, China September 4, 2021. REUTERS/Florence Lo 1 2

The Commission said it would carefully study the judgement and its implications and consider its next steps. Qualcomm did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

""The high-level conclusion is that the Court is telling the Commission to be extremely cautious in pricing abuses,"" said Assimakis Komninos, a partner at law firm White & Case.

""The Commission will now be very hesitant to start investigations into such cases unless they are really sure,"" he said.

This is the second major defeat for Vestager who in January lost the court's backing for a 1.06 billion euro fine on Intel 12 years ago for squeezing rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O).

Vestager's next test is on Sept. 14 when the General Court will rule on Google's challenge against a record 4.34 billion euro antitrust fine levied for using its Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals.

The case is T-235/18.

210,271,APPLE,2022-06-15,"China COVID controls makes Apple supplier Pegatron ""emphasise"" expansion elsewhere","













TAIPEI, June 15 (Reuters) - China's recent lockdowns to control the spread of COVID-19 have made Apple Inc (AAPL.O) iPhone assembler Pegatron Corp (4938.TW) ""emphasise"" its expansion in other countries, a senior executive at the Taiwanese firm said on Wednesday.

In April, Taiwan-headquartered Pegatron suspended operations at its Shanghai and Kunshan plants in China due to strict COVID-19 protocols, impacting production and deliveries. China has since lifted those restrictions.

However, the company is still facing labour shortages, exacerbated by COVID restrictions in China, leading the company to ""emphasise"" its expansion plans elsewhere, President Liao Syh-jang told an annual shareholder meeting in Taipei.

""We faced COVID controls for two months. We couldn't have assessed that in advance, so that makes me emphasise our expansions in Vietnam, India, Indonesia, and North America, to solve our labour shortage, the gap between peak and low seasons, and to increase the utilisation of our production capacity.""

In recent years, Pegatron has sought to expand its footprint in Southeast Asia and North America.

Chairman T.H. Tung added that their customers had ""different reasons"" for setting up factories in Vietnam, India and Mexico.

""But one shared factor is the ability to reduce concentration in Shanghai, Suzhou, Chongqing,"" Tung said, adding that recruiting staff in China has become increasingly difficult over the past seven to eight years.

Tung said that with the COVID pandemic easing globally, China coming out of its lockdowns to control the coronavirus and the electronics industry's peak season coming later in the year, the rest of 2022 should be much better for the company.

""Combining these factors, I expect the second half of the year to be better, or a lot better, than quarter two.""

Taiwanese firm Foxconn (2317.TW), the world's largest contract electronics maker which also assembles iPhones, last month predicted more stable supply in the second half of 2022.

LONDON, June 16 (Reuters) - Britons cancelled over 1 million music subscriptions in the first quarter as a worsening cost of living crisis forced them to make savings, industry data showed on Thursday.

Pessimism in British households has hit unprecedented levels, as wages struggle to keep pace with inflation that reached a 40-year high of 9% in April and is heading for double digits.

That is forcing many to eke out savings from household budgets.

Market researcher Kantar said 37% of UK consumers cited wanting to save money as the reason they cancelled music subscriptions in a market dominated in recent years by platforms such as Spotify (SPOT.N), Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O).

""The rising cancellation rates of music subscriptions is evidence that British households are starting to prioritise the spending of their disposable income,"" Kantar said.

It noted that in Britain, subscriptions are dropping the fastest amongst younger consumers, with the percentage of under 35s having access to a music subscription dropping from 57.0% to 53.5% year-on-year.

Kantar said penetration of total individuals who have access to at least one music subscription was 39.5% of British adults in the first quarter of 2022, down from 39.7% in the previous quarter.

That compares with an unchanged 48.8% in the United States and 36.6% in Germany, up from 35.9%.

In April, Kantar reported that Britons were cancelling television and film subscription services.

To cut costs, Britons are also trading down in both stores and products, switching from mainstream supermarkets to discounters and from branded to lower priced private label products. read more

They are also cutting back on fuel purchases as they reduce the number of car journeys they make and cancelling repair warranties on domestic appliances. read more

Poundland owner Pepco (PCOP.WA) said last week Britons were even reining in spending on essential items. read more

212,441,APPLE,2022-06-16,"U.S. Senators Leahy, Tillis introduce bill to revamp patent review board","Summary

Summary Related documents Bill addresses serial petitions, abuse of PTAB process

Proposal would also scrap rule that reduced number of reviews















(Reuters) - The two ranking members of the U.S. Senate's subcommittee on intellectual property introduced a bipartisan bill on Thursday that would make wide ranging reforms to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office tribunal that hears challenges to patent validity.

The proposed bill from Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina would modify an internal rule limiting the number of patents the Patent Trial and Appeal Board reviews, ban serial petitions by patent challengers and cover expenses for some patent owners defending their intellectual property.

Leahy said in a statement that he was ""proud to continue the work of ensuring that our patent system reinforces high-quality patents while protecting startups, small businesses and American manufacturers from patents that do not represent true innovation.""

Tillis said the bill maintains Trump-era reforms aimed at stopping big tech companies from misusing PTAB challenges while also ""preserving the vital role of the PTAB in furthering innovation.""

Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas also co-sponsored the bill.

The proposal would modify an internal PTO rule that gave PTAB judges more discretion to deny petitions based partly on whether related court litigation is closer to trial. Detractors have said patent plaintiffs misuse the rule by suing in fast-moving federal courts to avoid board review.

The proposed bill would stop the board from denying review based on parallel proceedings.

Leahy and Cornyn introduced separate legislation last year to change the rule. Tillis, who has previously said the rule helped make the board less of a ""death squad"" for patents, said Thursday that the new bill was a ""carefully crafted compromise requiring sacrifices from both sides.""

The new bill would also ban petitioners from repeatedly requesting reviews of patents that the board has already reviewed at their request, which the senators said would prevent harassment.

It also prescribes sanctions for parties that offer to sabotage their own cases in exchange for payment, and it would require the PTO to cover expenses for small businesses defending their patents at the board if they have not sued for infringement in court.

Taking to social media on Thursday, the chart-topper simply listed the words "" act i Renaissance"" and July 29 date in her bio. Streaming sites Spotify and Apple also posted artwork for the record.

Fans had anticipated news from the Grammy Award winner after the singer deleted her profile picture from social media platforms last week.

214,750,APPLE,2022-06-17,Regulator calls for Big Tech privacy cases to be handled by EU watchdog,"













BRUSSELS, June 17 (Reuters) - Cross-border Big Tech privacy cases should be handled by the EU watchdog rather than national agencies, the head of the bloc's data protection watchdog said on Friday as he lamented the poor enforcement of landmark rules adopted four years ago.

The rules known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have drawn criticism over the costs of compliance and long-running investigations with few decisions.

The Irish regulator, which has oversight of Google (GOOGL.O), Meta , Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N), has in particular come under fire for its slow pace of enforcement.

One solution could be to hand over big cases to the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) whose members are national privacy regulators and the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) which oversees EU institutions, EDPS head Wojciech Wiewiorowski said.

""I myself share views of those who believe we still do not see sufficient enforcement, in particular against Big Tech,"" he told a conference.

""At a certain moment, a pan-European data protection enforcement model is going to be a necessary step to ensure real and consistent high-level protection of fundamental rights to data protection and privacy across the European Union,"" Wiewiorowski said.

He said this could mean that key investigations, based on a certain threshold, would be done at a central level, in essence the EDPB, and subject to direct scrutiny of Europe's top court.

Empowering the EDPB to take on Big Tech cases directly would mean changing GDPR rules, a move which the European Commission is unlikely to do under the current leadership because of insufficient time, a European Commission official told Reuters.

June 21 (Reuters) - Meta (META.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and other tech giants racing to build the emerging metaverse concept have formed a group to foster development of industry standards that would make the companies' nascent digital worlds compatible with each other.

Participants in the Metaverse Standards Forum include many of the biggest companies working in the space, from chip makers to gaming companies, as well as established standards-setting bodies like the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the group said in an statement announcing its creation on Tuesday.

Conspicuously missing from the member list for now however is Apple (AAPL.O), which analysts expect to become a dominant player in the metaverse race once it introduces a mixed reality headset this year or next. read more

Gaming companies Roblox and Niantic also were not included among the forum's participants, nor were emerging crypto-based metaverse platforms like The Sandbox or Decentraland.

Apple has not yet publicly acknowledged plans for a headset, although it has reportedly given its board a sneak peek of the product, according to Bloomberg. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the new metaverse forum.

The logo of Meta Platforms is seen in Davos, Switzerland, May 22, 2022. Picture taken May 22, 2022. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo

Introducing such a device would put Apple in direct competition with Meta, which has staked its future on the growth of the metaverse and invested heavily in hardware to make its vision of interconnected virtual worlds a reality.

Meta, known as Facebook until it changed its name as part of its metaverse pivot last year, has disclosed plans for a mixed-reality headset code-named ""Cambria"" to be released this year.

Apple has been heavily involved in creating web standards such as HTML5 in the past. For three-dimensional content in the metaverse, Apple worked with Pixar on the ""USDZ"" file format and with Adobe to ensure it supported the format.

Neil Trevett, an executive at chip maker Nvidia who is chairing the Metaverse Standards Forum, said in a statement to Reuters that any company is welcome to join the group, including participants from the crypto world.

The forum aims to facilitate communication between a variety of standards organizations and companies to bring about ""real-world interoperability"" in the metaverse, he said, without addressing how Apple's absence would affect that goal.

Indexes up: Dow 2.15%, S&P 2.45%, Nasdaq 2.51%















June 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes jumped over 2% on Tuesday as investors scooped up shares of megacap growth and energy companies after the stock market swooned last week on worries over a global economic downturn.

All 11 major S&P 500 (.SPX) sectors gained, as stocks rebounded broadly after the benchmark index last week logged its biggest weekly percentage decline since March 2020.

Investors are trying to assess how far stocks can fall as they weigh risks to the economy with the Federal Reserve taking aggressive measures to try to tamp down surging inflation. The S&P 500 earlier this month fell over 20% from its January all-time high, confirming the common definition of a bear market.

""Do I think we have hit bottom? No. I think we are going to see more volatility, I think the bottoming process will likely take some time,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. ""But I do think it is a good sign to see investor interest.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 641.47 points, or 2.15%, to 30,530.25, and the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 89.95 points, or 2.45%, at 3,764.79. The Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 270.95 points, or 2.51%, at 11,069.30.

The energy sector (.SPNY), the top-gaining S&P 500 sector this year, surged 5.1% after tumbling last week. Every sector gained at least 1%.

Megacap stocks Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) all rose solidly to give the biggest individual boosts to the S&P 500. Apple rose 3.3%, Tesla jumped 9.4% and Microsoft added 2.5%.

The Fed last week approved its largest interest rate increase in more than a quarter of a century to stem a surge in inflation.

Investors are pivoting to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony to the U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday for clues on future interest rate hikes and his latest views on the economy.

Investors are ""trying to read the tea leaves to see how aggressive the Fed is going to get,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. ""That's a hard question to answer right now because they are going to see what happens to the inflation story.""

Summary Law firms Ashurst to launch its third U.S. outpost in Austin, Texas

More law firms are flocking to Austin owing to strong client demand















Reuters - International law firm Ashurst said Thursday it opened its third U.S. outpost in Austin, Texas, amid an influx of firms setting up shop in the city.

Ashurst is among a small group of U.K.-headquartered firms that have moved to Austin in the last few years. The firm entered the U.S. in New York in 2009 followed by Los Angeles in February 2020, according to Ashurst’s website.

Wes Strickland will be managing partner of the Texas office and is expected to split his practice between Los Angeles and Austin, Ashurst said.

Strickland will initially be joined by another lawyer from the firm's Los Angeles outpost, but Ashurst said it plans to eventually build up a small group of lawyers in Austin.

The firm’s Austin entry is a response to a surge in demand for counsel on infrastructure investment, development and finance matters in the transport, social infrastructure and water sectors, Ashurst said.The expansion ""puts us at the heart of infrastructure investment development in America,” said Anna Hermelin, co-head of Ashurst's Americas projects practice, in a statement.

Texas has been fertile ground for major corporations as the state has no corporate income tax and also because tech companies are hungry for fresh talent.

Major U.S. tech companies, including Oracle, Apple Inc, Google, Hewlett-Packard, SpaceX and Tesla Inc, have expanded their operations in the state in recent years.

Kirkland & Ellis, Latham & Watkins, O'Melveny & Myers, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and more recently Morrison & Foerster are some of the large U.S. law firms that opened in Austin between 2021 and 2022.

Northern California and Austin have recently been among the top destinations for large U.S. law firms expanding into new markets.

SAN FRANCISCO, June 23 (Reuters) - An Italian company's hacking tools were used to spy on Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Android smartphones in Italy and Kazakhstan, Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google said in a report on Thursday.

Milan-based RCS Lab, whose website claims European law enforcement agencies as clients, developed tools to spy on private messages and contacts of the targeted devices, the report said.

European and American regulators have been weighing potential new rules over the sale and import of spyware.

""These vendors are enabling the proliferation of dangerous hacking tools and arming governments that would not be able to develop these capabilities in-house,"" Google said.

The governments of Italy and Kazakhstan did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An Apple spokesperson said the company had revoked all known accounts and certificates associated with this hacking campaign.

RCS Lab said its products and services comply with European rules and help law enforcement agencies investigate crimes.

""RCS Lab personnel are not exposed, nor participate in any activities conducted by the relevant customers,"" it told Reuters in an email, adding it condemned any abuse of its products.

Google said it had taken steps to protect users of its Android operating system and alerted them about the spyware.

The global industry making spyware for governments has been growing, with more companies developing interception tools for law enforcement. Anti-surveillance activists accuse them of aiding governments that in some cases use such tools to crack down on human rights and civil rights.

The industry came under a global spotlight when the Israeli surveillance firm NSO’s Pegasus spyware was in recent years found to have been used by multiple governments to spy on journalists, activists, and dissidents.

While RCS Lab's tool may not be as stealthy as Pegasus, it can still read messages and view passwords, said Bill Marczak, a security researcher with digital watchdog Citizen Lab.

""This shows that even though these devices are ubiquitous, there’s still a long way to go in securing them against these powerful attacks,"" he added.

On its website, RCS Lab describes itself as a maker of ""lawful interception"" technologies and services including voice, data collection and ""tracking systems."" It says it handles 10,000 intercepted targets daily in Europe alone.

Google researchers found RCS Lab had previously collaborated with the controversial, defunct Italian spy firm Hacking Team, which had similarly created surveillance software for foreign governments to tap into phones and computers.

Hacking Team went bust after it became a victim of a major hack in 2015 that led to a disclosure of numerous internal documents.

In some cases, Google said it believed hackers using RCS spyware worked with the target's internet service provider, which suggests they had ties to government-backed actors, said Billy Leonard, a senior researcher at Google.

Summary Companies This content was produced in Russia where the law restricts coverage of Russian military operations in Ukraine















MOSCOW, June 23 (Reuters) - Russian e-commerce firm Ozon (OZON.O) said on Thursday it had started selling goods through a parallel imports mechanism on its platform, benefiting from legislation Russia has brought in to try to limit the impact of Western sanctions.

Hit by unprecedented sanctions and supply chain issues, Russia has legalised so-called parallel imports, which allow retailers to import products from abroad without the trademark owner's permission.

""Goods imported with the help of parallel imports are available on Ozon,"" the company told Reuters. ""We have already started selling popular electronics brands on Ozon, including smartphones and their components.""

Ozon said parallel imports gave Russian consumers a range of products but said it was working to prevent counterfeit items appearing on its platform, requiring sellers to confirm the proof of originality of the goods they sell.

Ozon said it would not disclose the names of brands.

Russia has included a wide range of goods from foreign carmakers, technology companies and consumer brands in the parallel imports scheme, aiming at shielding consumers from business isolation by the West after regular imports slumped due to sanctions and logistics disruptions. read more

Scores of foreign companies have withdrawn from Russia over Moscow's actions in Ukraine even though they face the prospect of new laws being passed in coming weeks allowing Moscow to seize assets and impose criminal penalties.

Nike (NKE.N) and Cisco have both announced plans to exit on Thursday. They have joined McDonald's (MCD.N), Renault (RENA.PA) and others. read more

Ozon competitor Wildberries in March described the parallel imports scheme as an effective support measure, highlighting its importance for small and medium-sized businesses and for the import of socially-significant products.

Wildberries, like others in the sector, has continued selling some goods from brands that have suspended operations in Russia. read more

Electronics retailer Svyaznoy has expanded its range to sell games consoles and smartphones from the likes of Apple and Samsung, the Kommersant daily reported on Thursday.

Svyaznoy told Reuters it was not an importer of appliances and electronics, but replenishes stocks available inside Russia.

Kommersant cited an industry source as saying that devices could be 10-20% more expensive than before Russia began what it calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

222,522,APPLE,2022-06-24,Analysis: Swiss policy pivot signals exit for big stock and bond investor,"Summary

Summary Companies Central bank no longer sees Swiss franc as ""highly valued""

Had invested FX bought to weaken the currency

May start unwinding its huge stock and bond holdings

SNB says would seek to minimise any market impact















LONDON, June 24 (Reuters) - From Silicon Valley shares to U.S. and European government bonds, securities that are already under heavy pressure stand to lose a major buyer as Switzerland ends its long-standing policy of recycling euros and dollars into foreign markets.

The Swiss National Bank recently delivered a surprise half-point interest rate hike and for the first time in years omitted references in its statement to the franc being highly valued.

The shift is a momentous one, suggesting the SNB will no longer prioritise weakening the currency by purchasing foreign exchange - a policy that enabled it to build a reserve pile of nearly $1 trillion.

Unlike most central banks, it recycled these proceeds of intervention into world markets rather than holding them at home, making it a huge stock and bond investor. In recent years it ranked among the top shareholders in the likes of Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. read more

Any reduction in its purchases, or an eventual move towards selling - a possibility after the bank said it is also ready to check a weakening of the franc - risks heightening volatility on already shaky markets.

""The SNB's departure from its previous approach to keep the franc weak means they will unwind their large U.S. stock holdings, particularly in FAANGS, which should increase selling pressure on these mega-cap names,"" said Kaspar Hense, senior portfolio manager at Bluebay Asset Management, referring to the tech quintet of Facebook (Meta), Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google.

The SNB had already cut back forex buying in recent weeks, as evidenced by a drop in ""total sight deposits"" at Swiss banks that are seen as a proxy for intervention. These deposits declined by 1.3 billion Swiss francs in the week ending June 17, versus a rise of 756 million francs a month earlier and an increase of nearly 6 billion francs in early April.

The SNB said it would seek to minimise the market impact whether it were to let existing bonds expire or actively sell assets, with the focus remaining on the overall liquidity of the portfolio.

With inflation above the SNB's target, the franc has been allowed to rise to seven-year highs against the euro , briefly pushing beyond one franc per euro in March. It has performed less well against the dollar , which has soared on expectations of aggressive policy tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve.

FAANGs

The SNB's recent policy shift is not quite on a par with its shock decision in 2015 to ditch the franc's euro exchange rate peg. But tighter policy and its potential step back from markets coincides with a deepening market selloff that has sent global stocks to a 21% loss this year.

Bond yields have also surged as inflation hits multi-decade highs, prompting steep rate hikes.

""In isolation, the impact (of potential asset sales) would have been limited but it comes in the middle of a sharp re-pricing and lower market liquidity so the effect will likely be magnified,"" said ING senior rates strategist Antoine Bouvet.

It is difficult to gauge accurately the impact of any investment pullback, as the SNB does not provide a breakdown of exactly which assets it holds in each currency.

SNB data does show that a quarter of its FX reserves were in equities as of end-March.

At that time, U.S. regulatory filings show the SNB's U.S. equity portfolio was worth $177 billion, including $12.4 billion in Apple shares, $9.5 billion in Microsoft and $6.4 billion in Amazon. Other holdings included $1.5 billion in Exxon Mobil and $1.1 billion in Coca Cola.

The SNB also holds 600 billion francs in foreign government bonds, making up 64% of FX reserves, according to Reuters calculations from SNB data.

Assuming bonds make up the same share of holdings in each currency as they do across its entire FX portfolio, Reuters calculations show that might include some $248 billion of U.S. Treasuries and 221 billion euros of euro zone government debt - most of it likely to be in top-rated bonds like Germany's.

""Their activities have been quite large over the last few years, and we did see in general increased euro holdings by central banks, and the SNB is one of them,"" BofA strategist Sphia Salim said. She predicted pressure on short-dated German bonds.

Unsurprisingly, last week's policy pivot sent euro zone and U.S. bond yields surging. read more

If the SNB were to wind down bond holdings, it would first stop reinvesting the proceeds of maturing bonds, Lyn Graham-Taylor, senior rates strategist at Rabobank said. That could see the SNB drop nearly 5 billion euros of German government debt by year-end, he estimates.

In 2023, ""you'll get those concerns around the SNB potentially selling bonds, merged with higher issuance next year and the potential for ECB QT,"" BofA's Salim said - a reference to expectations the European Central Bank may eventually start reducing its own balance sheet, a process known as Quantitative Tightening.

June 24 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O)accepts the outcome of a vote by Maryland store workers to become its first U.S. employees to join a union and is ready to bargain with them, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.

Apple is one of several major American companies whose workforces have moved to unionize, with workers at some Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and Amazon Inc (AMZN.O) locations also voting to join a union in recent months.

Nearly two-thirds of the employees at the Apple store in Towson, Maryland who organized as the Coalition of Organized Retail Employees (CORE), voted to join a union last week. The store is the first of Apple's roughly 270 U.S. outlets to do so.

The successful vote came after another planned vote in Georgia was called off earlier this year.

Apple intends to participate in the bargaining process in ""good faith,"" the person familiar with the matter said.

The Maryland employees voted to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM).

In a statement, David Sullivan, the union's eastern territory vice president, said the members ""look forward to bargaining with Apple and obtaining a strong first contract that makes positive changes for Apple workers and the customers they are proud to serve.""

Companies have responded to employee efforts to organize in different ways.

Amazon challenged the outcome of a plan to unionize at a warehouse in New York City, while Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O)President Brad Smith said in a blog post earlier this month that his company will not resist efforts by employees to organize.

Apple employees at a store in Georgia earlier this year had plans to vote on unionization but canceled the vote, with union officers later filing a complaint alleging Apple intimidated its employees. Employees at two other Apple stores in New York are also considering unionization.

224,302,APPLE,2022-06-27,U.S. Supreme Court won't hear Apple's bid to revive Qualcomm patent challenges,"[1/2] Apple logo is seen in this illustration taken March 1, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo















WASHINGTON, June 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) bid to revive an effort to cancel two Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) smartphone patents despite the global settlement of the underlying dispute between the two tech giants.

The justices turned away Apple's appeal of a lower court's ruling that the Cupertino, California-based company lacked standing to pursue the matter because of the settlement. Apple had argued that it should be allowed to appeal because San Diego-based Qualcomm could sue again after the settlement ends.

Qualcomm sued Apple in San Diego federal court in 2017, arguing that its iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches infringed a variety of Qualcomm mobile-technology patents. That case was one element of a broader dispute between the rivals.

Apple challenged the validity of the two patents at issue at the Patent and Trademark Office's Patent Trial and Appeal Board.

The parties settled their litigation in 2019, signing an agreement worth billions of dollars that allowed Apple to continue using Qualcomm chips in iPhones. The settlement also featured a license to tens of thousands of Qualcomm patents, including the two at issue, but allowed the patent board case to continue.

The board ruled in favor of Qualcomm. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent law, dismissed Apple's appeal last year based on the settlement. The Federal Circuit rejected Apple's contention that its royalty payments and risk of being sued again justified hearing the case on the merits.

Apple told the Supreme Court that it still faced the risk of litigation after the agreement expires in 2025, or in 2027 if the settlement term is extended. Qualcomm already sued once, has ""not disclaimed its intention to do so again,"" and has a ""history of aggressively enforcing its patents,"" Apple said.

Qualcomm asked the justices to reject the appeal, arguing Apple had not shown any concrete injury that would give it proper legal standing.

President Joe Biden's administration urged the Supreme Court to reject the appeal in a brief in May.

Summary Companies This content was produced in Russia, where the law restricts coverage of Russian military operations in Ukraine















MOSCOW, June 28 (Reuters) - Video streaming service Twitch, social network Pinterest, holiday rental company Airbnb and United Parcel Service (UPS) were all fined by a Moscow court on Tuesday for allegedly refusing to store Russian citizens' personal data in Russia.

Moscow has clashed with Big Tech over content, censorship, data and local representation in a simmering dispute that has erupted into a full-on battle since Russia sent its armed forces into Ukraine on Feb. 24.

The Moscow court's press service said Amazon-owned (AMZN.O) Twitch, Pinterest (PINS.N) and Airbnb (ABNB.O) had been found guilty by the Tagansky District Court of breaching Russian legislation on personal data and fined 2 million roubles ($37,700) each. UPS (UPS.N) was fined 1 million roubles.

A UPS spokesperson said: ""We are reviewing the court’s decision. As this review is ongoing we can provide no further information at this time.""

Twitch, Pinterest and Airbnb did not respond to requests for comment.

Russia's communications regulator Roskomnadzor said in late May that it had also opened an administrative case against U.S. tech giant Apple (AAPL.O).

For first-time offences, companies can be fined 1-6 million roubles, said Roskomnadzor.

Russia fined Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google 15 million roubles this month for what it said was repeated failure to comply with Russian legislation on data storage, after handing it a 3-million-rouble penalty last year. read more

Google's Russian subsidiary has filed for bankruptcy after authorities seized its bank account, making it impossible to pay staff and vendors. It is facing other possible fines over content. read more

Separately, the court said it had fined Canada-based storytelling platform Wattpad Corp. 1 million roubles for failing to delete content that Russia deems illegal.

Wattpad had no immediate comment.

226,769,APPLE,2022-06-28,Tencent to explore hardware opportunities with extended reality unit,"













HONG KONG, June 28 (Reuters) - China's Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) said it saw multiple opportunities to explore extended reality (XR) technologies in the next 4-5 years and that it had set up a unit focused on exploring the space, confirming an earlier Reuters report.

The company's gaming chief Steven Ma made the comments to local media on the sidelines of a mobile game event the Chinese tech giant held on Monday. Tencent later shared a transcript of the remarks with Reuters.

Ma said that the company had set up an XR business line that would combine both hardware and software due to its belief that most manufacturers exploring the space would take the approach of Apple (AAPL.O) and create closed ecosystems that bring together both elements.

""We hope to seize the opportunity in the next 4-5 years to actively experiment in software, content, systems, SDK tools, hardware and other links to create virtual reality experiences which can be industry benchmarks,"" he said.

Reuters reported last week that Tencent had announced to staff the official formation of the unit, citing sources who said it will eventually have over 300 staff. read more

Extended reality refers to immersive technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality, which are seen to be the building blocks of the metaverse, an immersive virtual world which many consider the next iteration of the internet

Tencent’s foray into extended reality reflects an intensifying race among global tech giants to capture opportunities in the metaverse. It also marks a rare move into hardward for Tencent, which is mostly known for its software.

Ma also said Tencent’s growing interest in XR resulted from the many technological breakthroughs the industry has seen with VR devices recently, including better display resolution and lighter headsets.

June 28 (Reuters) - Arm Ltd, the British chip technology firm owned by SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), on Tuesday unveiled a set of new chip technologies aimed at making video games on smartphones look better while preserving battery life.

The latest products are designs for graphics processing units, or GPUs, most often used for video processing in gaming. Arm makes money by licensing its blueprints to chip companies like MediaTek Inc (2454.TW) who in turn use them to design chips for Android-based smartphones.

Arm on Tuesday also upgraded plans for its CPUs, or central processing units, the main brains in a computer. In both cases, Arm is aiming to improve the performance of chips while using less electricity.

The latest push to improve mobile chips comes as Arm customers like Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) are reducing their dependence on Arm.

While Apple and Qualcomm still pay Arm some licensing fees to ensure their chips work with software written for Arm-based chips, they now design many more critical parts of their chips themselves rather than using Arm-made designs.

""Our latest suite of compute solutions for consumer devices will continue to raise the threshold of what's possible in the mobile market,"" said Arm executive Paul Williamson in a blog announcing the new products.

""For developers, making these immersive real-time 3D experiences even more compelling and engaging requires more performance.""

Law firms Related documents AliveCor accused Apple of copying heart-monitoring technology Judge initially finds infringement, full ITC could ban imports















(Reuters) - An administrative judge at the U.S. International Trade Commission said that Apple Watches violate AliveCor Inc's patent rights in wearable devices with electrocardiogram (ECG)technology, setting up a vote by the full commission that could lead to an import ban.

The judge's preliminary ruling Monday that Apple violates two AliveCor patents sets the stage for a ban on infringing Apple Watch imports if the full commission affirms the decision. The commission is expected to issue a final decision by Oct. 26.

The U.S. president can veto an import ban, but does so rarely. Parties can appeal a ban to the Federal Circuit after the presidential review period ends.

AliveCor CEO Priya Abani said in a statement Monday that the decision was ""a strong validation of our IP"" that ""underscores that patents matter and even an influential company like Apple cannot simply violate them to stifle innovation.""

Apple and its attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

AliveCor accused Apple of infringing three patents related to its KardiaBand, which monitors a user's heart rate, detects irregularities, and performs an electrocardiogram (ECG) to identify possible atrial fibrillation.

It told the ITC last year that Apple copied its ECG technology to use in Apple Watches beginning with its Series 4 model, and drove AliveCor out of the market by making the Apple operating system incompatible with the KardiaBand and AliveCor's SmartRhythm app. Apple responded that it does not infringe and that the patents are invalid.

AliveCor sued Apple last year in California federal court for allegedly monopolizing the U.S. market for Apple Watch heart-rate monitoring apps, in a case that is still ongoing.

AliveCor also sued Apple for patent infringement in West Texas in 2020. That case has been paused based on the ITC proceedings.The ITC case is In the Matter of Certain Wearable Electronic Devices with ECG Functionality and Components Thereof, U.S. International Trade Commission, Investigation No. 337-TA-1266.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, June 29 (Reuters) - A Republican member of the Federal Communications Commission has urged the chief executives of Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google to kick Chinese-owned TikTok out of its app stores.

Brendan Carr, the FCC commissioner, said in a letter to the CEOs, dated June 24 and sent on FCC letterhead, that video-sharing app TikTok has collected vast troves of sensitive data about U.S. users that could be accessed by ByteDance staff in Beijing. ByteDance is TikTok's Chinese parent.

Carr tweeted details of the letter on Tuesday.

""TikTok is not just another video app. That's the sheep's clothing,"" Carr said on Twitter. ""It harvests swaths of sensitive data that new reports show are being accessed in Beijing.""

Carr asked the companies to either remove TikTok from their app stores by July 8 or explain to him why they did not plan to do so.

Carr's request is unusual given that the FCC does not have clear jurisdiction over the content of app stores. The FCC regulates the national security space usually through its authority to grant certain communications licenses to companies.

A TikTok spokeswoman said the company's engineers in locations outside of the United States, including China, can be granted access to U.S. user data ""on an as-needed basis"" and under ""strict controls.""

Google declined comment on Carr's letter, while Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

TikTok has been under U.S. regulatory scrutiny over its collection of U.S. personal data. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews deals by foreign acquirers for potential national security risks, ordered ByteDance in 2020 to divest TikTok because of fears that U.S. user data could be passed on to China's communist government.

To address these concerns, TikTok said earlier this month that it migrated the information of its U.S. users to servers at Oracle Corp (ORCL.N). read more

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which chairs CFIUS, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

""What we're seeing here from Commissioner Carr is a suggestion that at least some parts of the U.S. government don't think that this is enough,"" Richard Sofield, a national security partner at law firm Vinson & Elkins LLP, said about TikTok's partnership with Oracle.

230,410,APPLE,2022-06-29,"China's smartphone makers gain ground in Russian market, says M.Video","













LONDON, June 29 (Reuters) - Chinese smartphones accounted for two-thirds of all new sales in Russia between April and June, the country's top electronics retailer said on Wednesday, the latest sign of how Moscow's invasion of Ukraine is impacting the country's consumer economy.

Several major smartphone makers, including Apple and Samsung, have paused new sales in Russia following Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, while financial sanctions and airspace bans have hit supply chains, pushing Russian retailers and consumers to look towards China to fill the gap.

""The total share of Chinese brands in the Russian market in terms of smartphone sales is steadily increasing - from 50% in the first quarter, to 60% in April to more than 70% in June,"" Russian electronics retailer M.Video-Eldorado (MVID.MM) said on Wednesday.

Overall, Chinese smartphones accounted for more than 65% of devices sold across the second quarter, up from 50% in the same period of 2021. Mobile operator MTS (MTSS.MM) reported a jump in sales of Chinese phones in May. read more

M.Video said the average price of a smartphone sold during the three-month period was down 4% on last year as Russian consumers shift to lower-ticket goods amid an earnings squeeze and economic downturn.

Apple and Samsung stopped new product sales in Russia after Moscow sent its army into Ukraine in late February, but retailers have been able to use up existing stocks. read more

231,667,APPLE,2022-06-30,"Global smartphone, PC shipments to decline in 2022 on China slowdown - Gartner","













June 30 (Reuters) - China's slowing economy and an inflation-driven drop in consumer spending are expected to drag down global shipments of computers and smartphones this year, according to research firm Gartner.

Shipments to China - the world's biggest smartphone market - are expected to shrink by 18% as demand takes a beating from strict COVID-19 curbs that halted activity in key economic hubs including Shanghai, Gartner said in a report on Thursday.

The research firm expects a 7% drop in worldwide smartphone shipments, also reflecting the expected toll of supply chain snarls and the Russia-Ukraine conflict on demand.

""A perfect storm of geopolitics upheaval, high inflation, currency fluctuations and supply chain disruptions have lowered business and consumer demand for devices across the world, and is set to impact the PC market the hardest in 2022,"" said Ranjit Atwal, senior director analyst at Gartner.

Gartner expects global computer shipments to drop 9.5% this year.

The forecast mirrors commentary from industry players, with chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) saying earlier this month that the PC market was set for a slowdown after two ""very strong"" years. read more

The soft demand for PCs and smartphones is likely to weigh on companies from chipmakers such as Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) to mega-cap tech firms including Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). Those companies are set to report second-quarter earnings starting next month.

June 30 (Reuters) - The former top corporate lawyer at Apple Inc (AAPL.O) pleaded guilty on Thursday to insider trading charges, for what prosecutors called a five-year scheme to trade ahead of the iPhone maker's quarterly earnings announcements.

Gene Levoff, 48, of San Carlos, California, pleaded guilty to six securities fraud charges at a hearing before U.S. District Judge William Martini in Newark, New Jersey.

Levoff allegedly exploited his roles as corporate secretary, head of corporate law and co-chair of a committee that reviewed drafts of Apple's results to generate $604,000 of illegal gains on more than $14 million of trades from 2011 to 2016.

Prosecutors said Levoff ignored the quarterly ""blackout periods"" that barred trading before Apple's results were released, as well as the company's broader insider trading policy -- which he was responsible for enforcing.

""Gene Levoff betrayed the trust of one of the world's largest tech companies for his own financial gain,"" First Assistant U.S. Attorney Vikas Khanna in New Jersey said in a statement.

A lawyer for Levoff did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Each count carries a maximum 20-year prison term and $5 million fine, though Levoff's punishment would likely be much less. Levoff's sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 10.

Apple, based in Cupertino, California, fired Levoff in September 2018, five months before he was criminally charged. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed related civil charges.

Authorities have said servers were located in New Jersey for firms that handled Levoff's trades, explaining why the criminal case was filed in that state.

The case is U.S. v. Levoff, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No. 19-cr-00780.

233,199,APPLE,2022-06-30,Apple eyes fuel purchases from dashboard as it revs up car software,"













June 30 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) wants you to start buying gas directly from your car dashboard as early as this fall, when the newest version of its CarPlay software rolls out, accelerating the company's push to turn your vehicle into a store for goods and services.

A new feature quietly unveiled at Apple's developer conference this month will allow CarPlay users to tap an app to navigate to a pump and buy gas straight from a screen in the car, skipping the usual process of inserting or tapping a credit card. Details of Apple's demo for developers have not previously been reported.

But Dallas-based HF Sinclair (DINO.N), which markets its gasoline at 1,600 stations in the United States, told Reuters that it plans to use the new CarPlay technology and will announce details in coming months.

""We are excited by the idea that consumers could navigate to a Sinclair station and purchase fuel from their vehicle navigation screen,"" said Jack Barger, the company's senior vice president of marketing.

Fuel apps are just the latest in a sustained push by Apple to make it possible to tap to buy from the navigation screen. It has already opened up CarPlay to apps for parking, electric vehicle charging and ordering food, and it also is adding driving task apps such as logging mileage on business trips.

Fuel is a major expense for car owners. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated in April that the average U.S. household will spend about $2,945 on gasoline in 2022, or about $455 more than last year.

Apple currently does not charge automakers, developers or users for CarPlay; the business interest is putting Apple at the forefront as cars transform into rolling computers, said Horace Dediu, an analyst with Asymco and founder of Micromobility Industries. The new feature will hit hundreds of car models already compatible with CarPlay when Apple releases software updates this fall.

""Forget about Apple Car - Apple CarPlay is a bigger deal,"" Dediu said. ""It's very likely to scale to millions and millions of cars, if not hundreds of millions.""

To use the new CarPlay feature this fall, iPhone users will need to download a fuel company's app to their phone and enter payment credentials to set up the app. After the app is set up, users will be able to tap on their navigation screen to activate a pump and pay.

""It's a massive marketplace, and consumers really want to take friction out of payments,"" said Donald Frieden, chief executive officer of Houston-based P97 Networks, which makes the digital plumbing that many fuel companies will use to connect their apps to cars.

Frieden said he has fielded calls from oil companies that are interested to make their apps work with CarPlay. BP (BP.L), Shell (SHEL.L) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N) did not respond to requests for comment about whether they plan to make their iPhone apps work with CarPlay.

FAILED ATTEMPTS

Apple's latest move is likely to increase tensions with automakers that have their own ambitions for commerce in the car.

For example, vehicle makers have tried - and failed - to popularize gasoline purchasing from the car before. General Motors Co (GM.N) rolled out a system for doing so in 2017, but shuttered it earlier this year ""due to a supplier exiting the business,"" GM told Reuters in a statement.

Beyond apps for fuel and other purchases, Apple is also seeking to expand CarPlay further into the car's driving systems by accessing speed and fuel gauge data. read more

But automakers are not likely to hand over that data to Apple without making demands of their own in talks that analysts believe are likely already under way.

Speaking at the Reuters Automotive Europe conference in Munich on Wednesday, Mercedes Benz CEO Ola Kaellenius said the company's goal ""is to have a complete, holistic, Mercedes experience.""

Kallenius said Mercedes would not seek to reinvent every category of app, but that ""when interacting with companies that are in this digital domain ... anything and everything that crosses into product liability relevance, we would be very cautious.""

234,810,APPLE,2022-06-30,"Exclusive: Meta slashes hiring plans, girds for 'fierce' headwinds","













June 30 (Reuters) - Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) has cut plans to hire engineers by at least 30% this year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees on Thursday, as he warned them to brace for a deep economic downturn.

""If I had to bet, I'd say that this might be one of the worst downturns that we've seen in recent history,"" Zuckerberg told workers in a weekly employee Q&A session, audio of which was heard by Reuters.

Meta has reduced its target for hiring engineers in 2022 to around 6,000-7,000, down from an initial plan to hire about 10,000 new engineers, Zuckerberg said.

Meta confirmed hiring pauses in broad terms last month, but exact figures have not previously been reported.

In addition to reducing hiring, he said, the company was leaving certain positions unfilled in response to attrition and ""turning up the heat"" on performance management to weed out staffers unable to meet more aggressive goals.

""Realistically, there are probably a bunch of people at the company who shouldn't be here,"" Zuckerberg said.

""Part of my hope by raising expectations and having more aggressive goals, and just kind of turning up the heat a little bit, is that I think some of you might decide that this place isn't for you, and that self-selection is OK with me,"" he said.

The social media and technology company is bracing for a leaner second half of the year, as it copes with macroeconomic pressures and data privacy hits to its ads business, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Thursday.

The company must ""prioritize more ruthlessly"" and ""operate leaner, meaner, better executing teams,"" Chief Product Officer Chris Cox wrote in the memo, which appeared on the company's internal discussion forum Workplace before the Q&A.

""I have to underscore that we are in serious times here and the headwinds are fierce. We need to execute flawlessly in an environment of slower growth, where teams should not expect vast influxes of new engineers and budgets,"" Cox wrote.

The memo was ""intended to build on what we've already said publicly in earnings about the challenges we face and the opportunities we have, where we're putting more of our energy toward addressing,"" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement.

The guidance is the latest rough forecast to come from Meta executives, who already moved to trim costs across much of the company this year in the face of slowing ad sales and user growth. read more

Tech companies across the board have scaled back their ambitions in anticipation of a possible U.S. recession, although the slide in stock price at Meta has been more severe than at competitors Apple (AAPL.O) and Google (GOOGL.O).

The world's biggest social media company lost about half its market value this year, after Meta reported that daily active users on its flagship Facebook app had experienced a quarterly decline for the first time. read more

Its austerity drive comes at a tricky time, coinciding with two major strategic pivots: one aimed at re-fashioning its social media products around ""discovery"" to beat back competition from short-video app TikTok, the other an expensive long-term bet on augmented and virtual reality technology.

In his memo, Cox said Meta would need to increase fivefold the number of graphic processing units (GPUs) in its data centers by the end of the year to support the ""discovery"" push, which requires extra computing power for artificial intelligence to surface popular posts from across Facebook and Instagram in users' feeds.

Interest in Meta's TikTok-style short video product Reels was growing quickly, said Cox, with users doubling the amount of time they were spending on Reels year over year, both in the United States and globally.

Some 80% of the growth since March came from Facebook, he added.

That user engagement with Reels could provide a key route to bolster the bottom line, making it important to boost ads in Reels ""as quickly as possible,"" he added.

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told investors in April that executives viewed Reels as ""a major part of the discovery engine vision,"" but at the time described the short video shift as a ""short-term headwind"" that would increase revenue gradually as advertisers became more comfortable with the format.

Cox said Meta also saw possibilities for revenue growth in business messaging and in-app shopping tools, the latter of which, he added, could ""mitigate signal loss"" created by Apple-led privacy changes.

He said the company's hardware division was ""laser-focused"" on successfully launching its mixed-reality headset, code-named ""Cambria,"" in the second half of the year.

(Reuters) - Video game maker Epic Games Inc on Wednesday accused Apple Inc of ""needlessly delaying"" a pivotal hearing in an antitrust clash in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals over key App Store policies.

The San Francisco-based U.S. appeals court said it was considering setting an argument hearing between October and December in Epic's effort to revive its case against Apple, and the court, as a matter of routine, asked the lawyers representing the two companies to reveal any date conflicts.

Apple's chief appellate lawyer, Mark Perry of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, told the court this week that October could work but wasn't ideal, since he'll be in final preparation mode for a major copyright trial that will tie him up in November and December. Perry is on the team defending software support company Rimini Street Inc against claims Oracle Corp filed in Nevada federal court.

On Wednesday, lawyers for Epic at Cravath, Swaine & Moore cried foul over Perry's schedule. October didn't pose an actual conflict, Cravath partner and former U.S. federal judge Katherine Forrest told the 9th Circuit. ""This is a scheduling preference, not an 'unavoidable conflict' with the October schedule,"" Forrest wrote.

Forrest and an Epic spokesperson didn't respond to a message seeking comment. Apple and its lawyers, who also include a team from Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, also didn't immediately comment.

A California federal judge last year after a trial ruled against Epic's claims that Apple's payment rules for apps were anticompetitive. Apple is appealing part of the court's order that said the company violated California's state unfair competition law.

Epic has asked the 9th Circuit to deem the case a hearing ""priority."" The Cary, North Carolina-based company, which makes the popular Fortnite game, said the case ""implicates important and time-sensitive issues"" under federal antitrust law. Epic filed its opening brief in January, after receiving a one-month extension.

The 9th Circuit asks lawyers for input before setting argument dates ""to minimize the need to remove a case from a calendar after judges invest time in it."" The court advises lawyers: ""Please do not submit scheduling preferences, only actual conflicts.""

The appeals court on Thursday did not immediately set an argument date.

The case is Epic Games Inc v Apple Inc, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-16506.

For Epic: Katherine Forrest of Cravath, Swaine & Moore

For Apple: Mark Perry of Weil, Gotshal & Manges and lawyers from Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher

236,289,APPLE,2022-06-30,"Enjoy Technology, led by ex-Apple and JC Penney executive Johnson, files bankruptcy","[1/2] Signage is seen at the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., August 24, 2020. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly















June 30 (Reuters) - Enjoy Technology Inc (ENJY.O), a Silicon Valley retailer led by former Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and JC Penney Co executive Ron Johnson, filed for bankruptcy protection on Thursday, fewer than nine months after going public through a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC).

The Palo Alto, California-based startup said it plans to sell its U.S. assets to Asurion LLC, a technology repair company.

Asurion agreed to provide $55 million of financing so Enjoy can operate while it reorganizes under Chapter 11 protection from creditors with the U.S. bankruptcy court in Delaware.

Founded by Johnson in 2014, Enjoy operates what it calls mobile retail stores that let customers buy smartphones and other technology that they can set up at home.

But in a court filing, a restructuring adviser said Enjoy has struggled with declining liquidity, in part because a large number of SPAC investors took back their money, as well as the ""supply chain crisis"" and an inability to retain staff.

Enjoy said it has just $523,000 of cash on hand. It also said its British unit is eliminating 411 jobs, or about 18% of the company's total workforce.

SPACs, or blank-check companies, are listed shell entities that let sponsors take private companies public faster than through traditional initial public offerings.

Many investors are pulling back from SPACs as the vehicles, which critics say are prone to conflicts of interest and shoddy due diligence, face tighter regulatory scrutiny. read more

Share prices of 291 companies that went public through SPAC mergers between 2019 and 2021 have fallen an average 58% since the mergers closed, according to University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter, citing data from SPACResearch.com.

Johnson became a star executive overseeing the growth of Apple's retail stores.

He became JC Penney's chief executive in November 2011, but was ousted 17 months later after his turnaround plan, emphasizing fixed prices and eschewing coupons, alienated customers used to big discounts.

In late afternoon trading, Enjoy shares were down 27.8% at 21 cents. They peaked at $12.16 on Oct. 12.

237,839,APPLE,2022-06-30,Gartner revises 2022 mobile sales estimates to fall 7.1%,"













STOCKHOLM, June 30 (Reuters) - Gartner forecast global mobile phone sales to fall 7.1% this year on Thursday, revising its earlier estimate of a growth of 2.2%, citing inflation, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and lockdowns in China.

Mobile phone shipments in 2022 is expected to fall to 1.46 billion units from 1.57 billion, and Gartner's earlier forecast of 1.60 billion.

""I have taken out about 150 million mobile shipment out of the forecast and what that say to you is the lifetimes (of mobiles) are increasing,"" Ranjit Atwal, senior director analyst at Gartner, told Reuters in an interview.

""For every three months people hold on to their phones, around 150 million units get lost.""

Worries of a global recession and high inflation in several countries might influence consumer decisions in spending for discretionary items.

The research firm also expects worldwide personal computer shipments to drop 9.5% in 2022, compared with its earlier forecast of a 4% fall. Lenovo (0992.HK), HP Inc (HPQ.N) and Dell (DELL.N) are the top three PC makers.

The declining PC and smartphone market will not get compensated by automobiles and other areas which will likely result in easing of chip shortage later this year, Atwal said.

Higher demand for smartphones and PCs during the pandemic had led tech companies to place big orders with chipmakers which resulted in shortage of semiconductors that are used in industries including automobiles and telecom.

Mobile phone makers Samsung (005930.KS) and Apple (AAPL.O) saw declining sales in several regions in the first quarter hit by China's COVID-19 lockdowns.

Smartphone shipments are estimated to decrease 5.8% this year and greater China shipment to fall 18.3%, Gartner said.

""At the beginning of the year, the greater China 5G phone market was expected to show double-digit growth,"" said Atwal.

""The back half of the year is very strong for China but even then its nowhere strong enough to compensate for what has happened.""

238,470,APPLE,2022-07-01,Google to pay $90 mln to settle legal fight with app developers,"[1/2] The logo of Google is seen at the high profile startups and high tech leaders gathering, Viva Tech,in Paris, France May 16, 2019.















WASHINGTON, June 30 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google has agreed to pay $90 million to settle a legal fight with app developers over the money they earned creating apps for Android smartphones and for enticing users to make in-app purchases, according to a court filing.

The app developers, in a lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco, had accused Google of using agreements with smartphone makers, technical barriers and revenue sharing agreements to effectively close the app ecosystem and shunt most payments through its Google Play billing system with a default service fee of 30%.

As part of the proposed settlement, Google said in a blog post it would put $90 million in a fund to support app developers who made $2 million or less in annual revenue from 2016-2021.

""A vast majority of U.S. developers who earned revenue through Google Play will be eligible to receive money from this fund, if they choose,"" Google said in the blog post.

Google said it would also charge developers a 15% commission on their first million in revenue from the Google Play Store each year. It started doing this in 2021.

The court must approve the proposed settlement.

There were likely 48,000 app developers eligible to apply for the $90 million fund, and the minimum payout is $250, according to Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP, who represented the plaintiffs.

Apple Inc (AAPL.O) agreed last year to loosen App Store restrictions on small developers, striking a deal in a class action. It also agreed to pay $100 million. read more

In Washington, Congress is considering legislation that would require Google and Apple to allow sideloading, or the practice of downloading apps without using an app store. Google says it already allows sideloading. It would also bar them from requiring that app providers use Google and Apple's payment systems. read more

239,190,APPLE,2022-07-01,Apple hikes Japan price of iPhone by nearly a fifth,"













TOKYO, July 1 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has hiked by nearly a fifth the cost of its flagship iPhone phone in Japan, which is battling a weakening yen currency and rising inflation.

The Cupertino, California-based manufacturer's entry level iPhone 13 now costs 117,800 yen ($870), Apple's website showed, compared to 99,800 yen previously.

With the dollar up 18% against the yen year-to-date, the higher cost of the iPhone, which dominates Japan's smartphone market, comes as consumers' wallets are being squeezed by price hikes for daily necessities.

Such widespread hikes are a change for most Japanese following years of stable prices for many products.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

240,821,APPLE,2022-07-01,New Zealand dairy and meat farmers disappointed in EU trade deal,"













WELLINGTON, July 1 (Reuters) - New Zealand dairy, sheep and beef farmers are largely disappointed by the newly signed New Zealand-European Union free trade agreement, lamenting it provides little new access to the profitable market for meat and dairy.

The agreement, which has been in negotiation since mid-2018, will remove tariffs on a wide range of products and be the first struck by the EU to include potential sanctions for violations of environmental or labour standards. (nL8N2YH52B)

Tariffs will fall for EU exports such as clothing, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and cars, as well as wine and confectionary. The EU will increase by 10,000 tonnes its quota of New Zealand beef, a sensitive area for France in particular, as well as raising volumes for lamb, butter and cheese.

The New Zealand government has said the agreement provides tangible gains into a restrictive agricultural market.

But the New Zealand meat and dairy sectors say this has very little impact on them.

Simon Tucker, a director of trade at dairy giant Fonterra (FCG.NZ), said in a statement that outcomes for dairy were very disappointing and reflect the degree of protectionism afflicting dairy trade globally.

Tucker said new commercial opportunities from the FTA for dairy products remained constrained relative to the relative size of the market.

Sirma Karapeeva, chief executive of the Meat Industry Association, added in a separate statement the FTA did not provide commercially meaningful access for meat exporters.

""With more volatility in global markets, diversification is important, and a high-quality FTA with the EU was critical in helping us achieve this,"" she said.

New Zealand agriculture exporters have long struggled to get good access to the market and analysts say the outcome should not have come as a huge surprise.

""Negotiating a deal with one of world’s most protectionist economic blocs was always going to be difficult and as such the benefits for broader New Zealand Inc. are modest,"" said Westpac Senior Agri Economist Nathan Penny.

He added that small New Zealand exporters such as firms in the kiwifruit, apple, wine, manuka honey and seafood sectors will see tariffs eliminated.

SHANGHAI, July 1 (Reuters) - Chinese smart vehicle supplier Shanghai PATEO Electronic Equipment Manufacturing Co said on Friday it had raised 1 billon yuan ($149.28 million) in a latest funding round led by state-owned investment firms.

Shanghai Guosheng Capital, Jinggangshan Investment and the investment arm of the country's biggest insurer Ping An Insurance Group (601318.SS) were the investors of this round of fundraising, PATEO said in a statement.

With the new funding, the company has raised a total of 2.5 billion yuan to improve its technology development and innovation, PATEO said. Xiaomi Corp (1810.HK), FAW Group and Dongfeng Motor Group (0489.HK) were among its investors.

The 13-year-old company said it had been supplying its software developed for smart vehicle cockpit and autonomous driving to nearly 30 auto brands.

As the global auto industry pursues an electric and smart future, automakers and tech companies are developing technologies to make vehicles more connected and autonomous.

Apple also said earlier it was talking to several automakers to bring the new generation of the Carplay software to make their cars smarter.

242,807,APPLE,2022-07-01,Analysis: Some investors bet top growth stocks will thrive in U.S. recession,"[1/2] A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., June 27, 2022. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo















NEW YORK, July 1 (Reuters) - Concerns about a possible U.S. recession are prompting some fund managers to rotate back into the big tech and growth winners of the last decade in the hope that they can better weather an economic storm.

Many stalwarts like Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Apple and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) have suffered declines on par with or exceeding those in broader stock indexes this year, as jumbo rate hikes delivered by an inflation-fighting Federal Reserve hit the tech and growth names that led markets in previous years.

Since growth companies tend to be less affected by the broader economy’s performance, however, some investors believe the category’s most profitable names may outperform the rest of the market if the Fed’s hawkish policy stance drags the U.S. into recession.

""You are starting to see some cracks in economic growth, which will help select companies that are very well positioned in the technology space,"" said Saira Malik, chief investment officer at Nuveen, who has been increasing her positions in companies including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N).

""The conceptual companies that don't have profitability will continue to be challenged because you need real fundamentals to back it up,"" she said.

The trade is still a nascent one. Global fund managers have increased their allocations to tech by approximately seven basis points as measured by the latest survey from BofA Global Research, although they remain bearish on the sector as a whole.

Retail investors, meanwhile, have been buying ""evergreen large tech companies"" such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on recent market dips, according to Vanda Research.

Overall, the Russell 1000 Growth index (.RLG) is down 28.4% year-to-date, well behind the 13.9% decline for the Russell 1000 Value index (.RLV), which contains stocks in more economically-sensitive sectors like energy. The benchmark S&P 500 index is down 20.7%, marking its worst first-half of the year since 1970. read more

Some names in tech have suffered even steeper losses: Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK.P), which holds an array of newer companies including Zoom Video Communications and Teladoc, is down 57.7% year-to-date. read more

Meanwhile, recession worries have grown in recent weeks. A global poll of investors by Deutsche Bank in June found that 90% now expect a U.S. recession by the end of 2023, up from 78% the month before.

'ATTRACTIVE VALUATIONS'

For Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, those concerns are a good reason to increase positions in companies such as Google-parent Alphabet. Janasiewicz is also betting that the pounding their shares have taken has lowered valuations to attractive levels.

The forward price to earnings ratio for the S&P 500 technology sector, for instance, is down to 19.1, its lowest level since early 2020, according to Yardeni Research.

""We are seeing some of the most attractive valuations for this space that we've seen in a long time,"" Janasiewicz said.

Of course, signs of continued high inflation could further ramp up expectations for Fed hawkishness, potentially driving up bond yields and dealing another blow to tech and growth stocks.

Higher yields dull the allure of companies in technology and other high-growth sectors, whose cash flows are often heavily weighted in the future and are diminished when discounted at higher rates.

Earnings season, which kicks off in July, may present another risk. One important factor for tech companies is likely to be the strength of the dollar, which cuts into profits from overseas earnings. Microsoft cited the strong dollar when it cut forecasts June 2. read more

""We think a better approach for global investors is to stay diversified and rely upon stock selection to extract value from markets,"" said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Allspring Global Investments.

Others, however, are betting that a tech bounce may be ahead.

Signs that commodity prices may have peaked could pave the way for the Fed to pull back from its aggressive rate hiking path in September, said Lindsey Houghton, a portfolio manager on Harbor Capital’s Multi-Asset Solutions Team.

Houghton's firm has been selling some of its energy holdings to rotate shares of large technology companies, which he believes could rally by 20% or more a year over the next several years due to their depressed valuations and increasing market share.

""Over the last two months, those valuations have started to get to a point where they look quite attractive to us,"" he said.

Balance median forecast $3.26 bln (prior month $2.41 bln)

CPI median forecast +3.5% y/y (prior month +3.39%)















TAIPEI, July 5 (Reuters) - Taiwan's exports likely rose for the 24th straight month in June and at a faster clip than in May, thanks to easing supply chain woes and stronger technology demand, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.

Taiwan, a global hub for chip production and a key supplier to Apple Inc (AAPL.O), is one of Asia's leading exporters of technology goods, so the trade data is seen as an important gauge of world demand for tech gadgets.

Exports last month were estimated to have risen 13.55% from a year earlier, a Reuters poll of 18 analysts showed, faster than the 12.5% jump in May.

The export forecasts ranged between rises of 6% and 19.4%, reflecting uncertainties over the global economic recovery and supply chain disruptions caused by COVID-19 lockdowns in eastern China and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Separately, the consumer price index was expected to have risen 3.5% from a year earlier, a slightly quicker rate than an on-year increase of 3.39% in May.

The inflation data will be released on Wednesday, followed by the trade data on Friday.

BRUSSELS, July 5 (Reuters) - EU lawmakers gave the thumbs up on Tuesday to landmark rules to rein in tech giants such as Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Facebook and Microsoft (MSFT.O), but enforcement could be hampered by regulators' limited resources.

In addition to the rules known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA), lawmakers also approved the Digital Services Act (DSA), which requires online platforms to do more to police the internet for illegal content.

Companies face fines of up to 10% of annual global turnover for DMA violations and 6% for DSA breaches. Lawmakers and EU states had reached a political deal on both rule books earlier this year, leaving some details to be ironed out. read more

The European Commission has set up a taskforce, with about 80 officials expected to join up, which critics say is inadequate. Last month it put out a 12 million euro ($12.3 million) tender for experts to help in investigations and compliance enforcement over a four-year period.

EU industry chief Thierry Breton sought to address enforcement concerns, saying various teams would focus on different issues such as risk assessments, interoperability of messenger services and data access during implementation of the rules.

Regulators will also set up a European Centre for Algorithmic Transparency to attract data science and algorithm scientists to help with enforcement.

""We have started to gear the internal organisation to this new role, including by shifting existing resources, and we also expect to ramp up recruitment next year and in 2024 to staff the dedicated DG CONNECT team with over 100 full time staff,"" Breton said in a blogpost.

DEEP POCKETS

Lawmaker Andreas Schwab, who steered the issue through the European Parliament, has called for a bigger taskforce to counter Big Tech's deep pockets and array of lawyers.

European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) echoed the same worries.

""We raised the alarm last week with other civil society groups that if the Commission does not hire the experts it needs to monitor Big Tech's practices in the market, the legislation could be hamstrung by ineffective enforcement,"" BEUC Deputy Director General Ursula Pachl said in a statement.

The DMA is set to force changes in companies' businesses, requiring them to make their messaging services interoperable and provide business users access to their data.

Business users would be able to promote competing products and services on a platform and reach deals with customers off the platforms.

Companies will not be allow to favour their own services over rivals' or prevent users from removing pre-installed software or apps, two rules that will hit Google and Apple hard.

The DSA bans targeted advertising aimed at children or based on sensitive data such as religion, gender, race and political opinions. Dark patterns, which are tactics that mislead people into giving personal data to companies online, will also be prohibited. ($1 = 0.9754 euros)

French FinMin calls Deezer's market debut a ""success""

Deezer lacks the financial firepower of bigger rivals















PARIS, July 5 (Reuters) - Shares of French music-streaming platform Deezer plunged as much as 35% on its first trading day, in a blow to telecoms maverick Xavier Niel and luxury billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault, who made the company's market debut possible.

Deezer, one of the country's first so-called ""unicorns"", or tech companies valued more than 1 billion euros, has been struggling to convince on its capacity to take on bigger rivals Spotify (SPOT.N) and Apple Music (AAPL.O).

""The sector is super competitive,"" DZ Bank analyst Manuel Muehl said. ""There are multiple services - Amazon Prime, Apple Music etc - which are run by large U.S. companies with very deep pockets.""

""(They) can subsidise their business with other income streams, and therefore they do not depend on the success of their music-platforms unlike 'pure-play' companies do.""

Deezer was down 24% at 1149 GMT at 6.52 euros per share, after opening at 8.50 euros. It had earlier sunk as much as 35%.

""There's a question over their capacity to grow and yield profits,"" an industry source said.

Deezer's stock listing was made possible via its merger with a blank-check company, I2PO, notably backed by French banker Matthieu Pigasse, Niel and Artemis, the holding company of the Pinault family which controls Gucci owner Kering (PRTP.PA).

Deezer announced its stock market listing in Paris in April in a deal valuing the business at just over 1 billion euros ($1 billion).

Services like Deezer and its rivals represent a shift in the music industry away from buying and downloading tracks and towards listening online to songs stored remotely.

Founded in 2007, or just year after Spotify, Deezer has contemplated entering the stock market for years. It postponed previous IPO plans in 2015 due to market conditions.

The fall in shares did not stop French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who attended the ceremony marking Deezer's market debut, from praising Deezer for its stock listing.

""@DeezerFR's IPO is not only an economic and technological success, but it is also a cultural success,"" Le Maire tweeted. ""Defending Deezer is defending our culture... our musical heritage.""

246,685,APPLE,2022-07-06,Meme stock GameStop jumps on share split bandwagon,"













July 6 (Reuters) - GameStop Corp's (GME.N) board has approved a four-for-one stock split that will make it more affordable for investors to own shares of the video-game retailer at the center of last year's ""meme stock"" trading frenzy.

Shares of the company shot up 5.8% to $124.49 in extended trading on Wednesday after the announcement.

Several major U.S. companies have opted for stock splits over the past two years, including Apple (AAPL.O), Tesla (TSLA.O) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O).

A stock split makes shares more affordable for individual investors by lowering the price without affecting the company's valuation.

Shares of GameStop skyrocketed more than 680% in 2021 thanks to retail traders on social media platforms such as Reddit who snapped up heavily shorted stocks in a bid to squeeze out hedge funds betting against them.

""GameStop management knows that they have a 100% retail shareholder base and so, they are catering to them,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter.

""It (the stock split) is also a distraction because the NFT market is dead, and that was the last thing that they did that tried to get people excited.""

This year, the video-game retailer's shares have wound down roughly 20% as the Ukraine crisis and fears of a global recession clouded sentiment.

The company said in March it would seek shareholder approval for the split which would increase its outstanding Class A common shares to 1 billion from 300 million.

Under the split, shareholders will receive a stock dividend of three additional shares of GameStop's Class A common stock for each share held. read more

The dividend will be distributed after markets close on July 21.

247,727,APPLE,2022-07-06,Facebook asks U.S. court for old FTC merger documents in antitrust fight,"













WASHINGTON, July 6 (Reuters) - Meta's Facebook has asked a U.S. court for eight documents created by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission as part of their review of the company's purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp, which the agency allowed to go forward.

The request was made late on Tuesday and comes in a lawsuit filed by the FTC that has asked the court to order both of those deals undone. Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014.

The FTC sued Meta's Facebook in 2020, during the Trump administration, alleging that the company acted illegally to maintain its social network monopoly.

Facebook is fighting the lawsuit, and wants the materials as part of that fight.

""Both the Instagram and the WhatsApp documents are almost certain to reveal that the FTC determined that each acquisition was unlikely to lessen competition or harm consumers,"" Facebook said in its filing.

The company argued that the FTC had given the documents to the House Judiciary Committee when it probed the tech giants, also including Amazon(AMZN.O), Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O) and Apple (AAPL.O). Current FTC Chair Lina Khan was on the staff of that committee.

""Any claim of privilege was waived when the FTC chose to voluntarily share the documents with House Judiciary Committee members and staff,"" Facebook said in its filing.

The FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the filing.

Among the documents being requested are the memos that the FTC Bureau of Competition and Bureau of Economics wrote for commissioners about whether the Instagram deal should be allowed to close. Meta is also asking for notes made by Bureau of Competition personnel about the WhatsApp transaction.

The move comes after at least two Israeli firms have exploited flaws in Apple's software to remotely break into iPhones without the target needing to click or tap anything. NSO Group, the maker of the ""Pegasus"" software that can carry out such attacks, has been sued by Apple and placed on a trade blacklist by U.S. officials.

""Lockdown Mode"" will come to Apple's iPhones, iPads and Macs this fall and turning it on will block most attachments sent to the iPhone's Messages app. Security researchers believe NSO Group exploited a flaw in how Apple handled message attachments. The new mode will also block wired connections to iPhones when they are locked. Israeli firm Cellebrite has used such manual connections to access iPhones.

Apple representatives said that they believe sophisticated attacks the new feature is designed to fight - called ""zero click"" hacking techniques - are still relatively rare and that most users will not need to active the new mode.

Spyware companies have argued they sell high-powered technology to help governments thwart national security threats. But human rights groups and journalists have repeatedly documented the use of spyware to attack civil society, undermine political opposition, and interfere with elections.

To help harden the new feature, Apple said it will pay up to $2 million for each flaw that security researchers can find in the new mode, which Apple representatives said was the highest such ""bug bounty"" offered in the industry.

Apple also said it is making a $10 million grant, plus any possible proceeds from its lawsuit against NSO Group, to groups that find, expose and work to prevent targeted hacking. Apple said the grant will go to the Dignity and Justice Fund established by the Ford Foundation, one of the largest private foundations in the United States.

REUTERS/Ernest Scheyder















July 7 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) said on Thursday it bought another 12 million shares of Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) this week, giving it an 18.7% stake in the oil company.

The purchases were made on Tuesday and Wednesday and cost about $698 million, Berkshire said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

Buffett's company had also purchased 9.9 million Occidental shares last week.

It is by far the largest shareholder of Houston-based Occidental, owning 175.4 million shares worth $10.8 billion.

Berkshire also owns $10 billion of Occidental preferred stock, and has warrants to buy another 83.9 million common shares for $5 billion, or $59.62 each. That is slightly below the shares' Thursday closing price of $61.47.

Occidental's share price has more than doubled this year, helped by Berkshire's purchases as well as rising oil prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Berkshire's growing stake has prompted market speculation that Buffett's company might eventually buy all of Occidental.

If the stake reached 20%, Berkshire could consider an accounting change that would let it record its proportionate share of Occidental's earnings with its own results.

Berkshire uses the equity method of accounting for its 26.6% stake in Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), the packaged food company.

Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate owns dozens of businesses including the BNSF railroad, Geico car insurer and its namesake energy business, as well as stocks including Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N).

Occidental has been reducing debt since purchasing Anadarko Petroleum Corp for $35.7 billion in 2019. Berkshire's preferred stock investment helped finance that takeover.

Berkshire's share price has fallen 7% this year, compared with an 18% decline in the Standard & Poor's 500 (.SPX).

250,548,APPLE,2022-07-07,EXCLUSIVE EU antitrust regulators probing tech group AOM's video licensing policy,"













BRUSSELS, July 7 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are investigating the video licensing policy of the Alliance for Open Media (AOM), whose members include Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Meta , the European Commission said on Thursday.

The investigation is the latest to hit the tech industry, which will be subject to tough new rules in Europe next year that could force companies to change their core business models and do more to tackle illegal content on their platforms.

""The Commission confirms that it has a preliminary investigation ongoing into AOM's licensing policy,"" a spokesperson for the EU executive told Reuters.

""The fact that the Commission has a preliminary investigation does not prejudge the outcome of the investigation on the existence of an infringement,"" the spokesperson said, without providing further details.

AOM did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Founded in 2015, the group aims to create a new standard software for streaming higher-quality 4K video on browsers, devices, apps, and gaming, known as AV1.

While the AV1 software is not yet adopted widely, Netflix (NFLX.O) and YouTube have started using it for some customers, and browsers such as Google Chrome and Firefox have started to support the new format.

Apple and Google did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Meta and Amazon declined to comment. Microsoft (MSFT.O), Netflix, Broadcom (AVGO.O), Cisco (CSCO.O) and Tencent (0700.HK), who are also AOM members, did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.

Intel (INTC.O), Huawei (HWT.UL), Mozilla, Samsung (005930.KS) and Nvidia (NVDA.O) are also AOM members, according to its website.

In a questionnaire sent to some companies earlier this year and seen by Reuters, the EU watchdog said it was investigating alleged anti-competitive behaviour related to the license terms of AV1 by AOM and its members in Europe.

""The Commission has information that AOM and its members may be imposing licensing terms (mandatory royalty-free cross licensing) on innovators that were not a part of AOM at the time of the creation of the AV1 technical, but whose patents are deemed essential to (its) technical specifications,"" the paper said.

It said this action may be restricting the innovators' ability to compete with the AV1 technical specification, and also eliminate incentives for them to innovate.

The questionnaire also asked about the impact of an AOM patent license clause in which licensees would have their patent licenses terminated immediately if they launched patent lawsuits asserting that implementation infringes their claims.

Companies risk fines of up to 10% of their global turnover for breaching EU antitrust rules.

NEW YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - As U.S. companies open their books on the second quarter in the coming weeks, investors increasingly worried about a recession will be anxious to hear what executives say about how demand is holding up in the face of higher costs.

Concerns over a possible recession have already driven a sharp selloff in stocks that resulted in the S&P 500's (.SPX) steepest percentage drop in the first-half of a year since 1970.

But earnings forecasts for the year have largely held up. That has raised questions among some investors about whether current earnings projections reflect those concerns and can remain strong enough to support the market.

Investors have been trying to to figure out whether an aggressive interest rate hike cycle by the U.S. Federal Reserve to tame inflation could tip the economy into recession.

With recession talk having increased in the market, upcoming corporate results and outlooks ""are going to be the key catalyst going forward,"" said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates in Toledo, Ohio.

Earnings from some of Wall Street's biggest banks will unofficially start off the earnings period when they report next week, with results from JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) due Thursday.

For the second quarter, analysts expect overall S&P 500 earnings to have increased 5.7% over the year-ago period, compared to growth of 6.8% expected at the start of April, while they see earnings for all of 2022 growing by 9.4% versus 8.8% expected on April 1, according to IBES data from Refinitiv as of Friday.

Those forecasts, however, are somewhat distorted by the energy sector, whose earnings are forecast to have jumped by more than 230% in the second quarter following a rally in oil prices. Without energy companies, second-quarter profits are expected to have declined 3% from a year ago, based on Refinitiv data.

""While companies may be able to deliver a decent second quarter, the outlooks are likely to be overall very conservative,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York.

Last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told a European Central Bank conference that ""there is a risk"" the U.S. central bank could slow the economy more than needed to control inflation.

Commodity and other costs have been rising, and companies have been grappling with how much of those price increases can be passed on to consumers or absorbed.

Among companies that have already reported, Micron Technology Inc (MU.O) recently projected a fall in current-quarter revenue, sparking concerns about demand in the chip industry. read more

Nike Inc (NKE.N) forecast quarterly revenue below estimates as it expects to discount more. read more

Technology and growth stocks, whose valuations rely more heavily on future cash flows, have been among the hardest hit by concerns over rising rates.

Meta Platforms (META.O) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg recently told employees to brace for a deep economic downturn. read more Its shares fell 27% in the second quarter.

Apple (AAPL.O), whose shares slid about 22% in the second quarter, is due to report results July 28, while results for Alphabet (GOOGL.O), whose shares also dropped 22% last quarter, are expected July 26.

While higher energy prices are expected to be a drag on airlines and other transportation companies as well as some industrial firms, they are a positive for energy names. Chevron (CVX.N) is due to report on July 29.

Goldman Sachs' brokerage recently trimmed its estimates for someconsumer-exposed companies including Apple, citing demand concerns.

Valuations have fallen with the market's selloff. The S&P 500's forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio was at 16.2 as of Friday versus 22.1 at the end of December and was in line with its long-term average of about 16, Refinitiv data showed.

While the drop has made valuations seem more attractive to some investors, others worry about what's in store for earnings forecasts.

Market sentiment already has become more bearish and multiples have come down, said Matt Stucky, senior portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company. ""The next shoe to drop typically is a revision lower in terms of earnings estimates by the sell side.""

252,305,APPLE,2022-07-11,California top court asked to review solar workers' security checks,"Summary

Summary Law firms Workers drove down long road, waited for vehicle inspections

Judge tossed their lawsuit, saying company didn't control them

Calif. top court ruled for Apple workers in similar case















(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court has asked California's top state court to decide whether a construction company should have paid workers at a solar power facility for the time they spent driving to the remote site and waiting for their vehicles to be inspected by security.

A 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel certified questions on Friday to the California Supreme Court in a proposed class action against CSI Electrical Contractors Inc and First Solar Electric Inc, which owns the Monterey County facility.

CSI employees were required to drive several miles down a dirt road at low speeds to protect local wildlife, and then wait up to 20 minutes to be checked before entering and leaving the facility, according to court filings.

Plaintiff George Huerta in the 2018 lawsuit in San Francisco federal court accused CSI and First Solar of various violations of California wage laws.

A California federal judge last year said the companies did not exercise enough control over the workers during that time to be required to pay them under state law. Huerta is seeking to revive the case.

Lawyers for Huerta did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Neither did lawyers at Ford Harrison which represents the companies.

Lawsuits seeking pay for time that workers spend waiting for security screenings before or after shifts have become increasingly common in recent years. Most of those cases have involved retail or warehouse workers, such as in lawsuits against Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Walmart Inc.

In the 2014 case Integrity Staffing Solutions Inc v. Busk, which involved Amazon warehouse workers in Nevada, the U.S. Supreme Court said security checks are not compensable under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act because they are incidental to workers' primary job duties.

But wage laws in California and other states are broader than the FLSA, and workers have won a series of favorable rulings from appeals courts on state law claims.

The California Supreme Court in a 2020 ruling involving Apple retail employees said the key factor to consider under California law is the degree of control an employer exerts over workers while they are waiting to be checked.

The 9th Circuit panel on Friday said CSI employees appeared to be under less control than the Apple workers because they were merely required to roll down their windows and present a badge to security guards.

The case is Huerta v. CSI Electrical Contractors Inc, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-16201.

For the plaintiffs: Peter Dion-Kindem of the Dion-Kindem Law Firm; Lonnie Blanchard

For CSI: Daniel Chammas and Ming Kim of Ford Harrison

Summary Law firms

Law firms Related documents Ericsson won injunction from Bogota court last week

Apple says Ericsson wants to force it into 'grossly excessive' license costs















(Reuters) - Apple Inc accused Ericsson Inc on Friday of covertly filing patent lawsuits in Colombia in a bid to force Apple to abandon a Texas court dispute and agree to an unfair patent license.

Apple told the federal court in Marshall, Texas, that Ericsson filed more than ten lawsuits in Colombia, all ""in secret"" and ""with absolutely no notice to Apple,"" seeking leverage in their fight over licensing rates for Ericsson's 5G wireless standard-essential patents.

A Bogota court blocked Apple from selling phones that allegedly infringe an Ericsson 5G patent in one of the cases last week, Apple said.

Ericsson declined to comment Monday. Apple and its attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Owners of patents covering technology necessary to comply with international standards must offer licenses on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. Disputes over FRAND licensing have led to several high-profile battles in the telecom industry.

Ericsson sued Apple in Texas last year, seeking a declaration that it offered Apple FRAND terms for its 5G wireless patents and arguing Apple's licensing policies were unfair. According to Apple's filing, the companies agreed that the Texas case would ""lead to a binding resolution of FRAND terms for a global cross-license.""

Apple accused Ericsson on Friday of filing""secret, ex parte"" requests for court orders around the world blocking imports and sales of its products, forcing Apple to either deal with the costs or submit to Ericsson's demands before the Texas court's planned December trial.

""Ericsson knows that a December trial will expose its royalty demands as grossly excessive and directly contrary to FRAND,"" Apple said.

Most of Ericsson's efforts have been unsuccessful, but the Bogota court granted Ericsson a preliminary injunction on Thursday, Apple said.

Apple asked the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas to force Ericsson to cover Apple's expenses from the Colombia litigation.

Apple also accused Ericsson of hypocrisy, noting the Swedish telecom giant won an order from the same Texas court blocking Samsung from using proceedings in China to interfere with their now-settled dispute over patent licensing.

The case is Ericsson Inc v. Apple Inc, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, No. 2:21-cv-00376.

254,515,APPLE,2022-07-11,"Klarna helps investors to buy now, cry later","













LONDON, July 11 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Klarna is putting a positive spin on its shareholders’ misery. The private buy-now-pay-later group on Monday confirmed it has raised $800 million in new funding, valuing it at $6.7 billion. That’s an 85% decline for investors who valued the Swedish company at $45.6 billion in June last year, including Japan’s SoftBank Group (9984.T).

Klarna can blame the flighty market, which is now penalising cash-guzzling technology stocks. The latest valuation is equivalent to just under 5 times 2022 sales, if first-quarter revenue of $352 million is annualised. That’s in line with the average of listed players Affirm (AFRM.O) and Zip , according to Refinitiv data. Michael Moritz, partner of long-standing investor Sequoia, bemoaned investors “suddenly voting in the opposite manner to the way they voted for the past few years”.

But Chief Executive Sebastian Siemiatkowski struck an optimistic tone. He argues Klarna shareholders are still up some 219% from 2018’s valuation, beating rivals like PayPal (PYPL.O) and Jack Dorsey’s Block (SQ.N). Still, the outlook is much less certain than in 2018, with a global recession looming and competition from groups like Apple (AAPL.O) heating up. Klarna’s losses hit 2.6 billion Swedish crowns ($242 million) in the first three months of 2022, compared to a gain of 97 million crowns ($9 million) at the same period in 2017. Despite Siemiatkowski’s spin, the sharp valuation decline points to deeper problems for Klarna and its peers. (By Karen Kwok)

255,700,APPLE,2022-07-11,OECD sees global corporate tax overhaul on course for 2024,"













PARIS, July 11 (Reuters) - The biggest overhaul of cross-border tax rules in a generation is now on course to take effect in 2024, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said on Monday in an update on the project for G20 finance ministers.

The shake-up, which has been shepherded by the OECD and which nearly 140 countries agreed to last year, aims to take better account of the emergence of big digital companies, such as Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) that can book profits in low-tax countries.

The first pillar of the two-track reform aims to reallocate 25% of profits from the world's largest multinationals for taxation in the countries where their clients are regardless of the companies' physical location. The second pillar aims to set global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%.

Both pillars were originally due to be implemented next year, although that was always seen as highly ambitious given the difficulty of agreeing complex changes to many countries' tax laws.

""We will keep working as quickly as possible to get this work finalised, but we will also take as much time as necessary to get the rules right,"" OECD Secretary General Mathias Cormann said in statement.

""These rules will shape our international tax arrangements for decades to come,"" he added.

The OECD said in a report for G20 finance ministers this week in Bali that the new timetable for the first pillar set a hard mid-2023 deadline for sign-off on the multilateral legal framework underpinning it so it can enter into force in 2024.

Meanwhile, it said most countries were planning legislation to adopt the global minimum tax rate so that it also enters into force in 2024.

REUTERS/Stephen Nellis/File Photo















OAKLAND, Calif., July 12 (Reuters) - A supply chain crisis triggered by the global pandemic deprived makers of PCs and smartphones to cars of computer chips needed to make their products.

All that suddenly changed over three weeks from late May to June, as high inflation, China's latest COVID lockdown, and the war in Ukraine dampened consumer spending, especially on PCs and smartphones.

Chip shortages turned into a glut in some sectors, taking Wall Street by surprise. By late June, memory chip firm Micron Technology Inc (MU.O) said it would reduce production. The market reversal caught Micron off guard, admitted Chief Business Officer Sumit Sadana. read more

As U.S. chip earnings reporting season kicks off later this month, TechInsights' chip economist Dan Hutcheson warned of more bad news following Micron's grim forecast. ""Micron kind of plowed the ground, with their honesty,"" he said.

Worries about an industry downturn have slammed chip stocks, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index (.SOX) tumbling 35% so far in 2022, far more than the S&P 500's (.SPX) 19% loss.

Global chip sales vs Philadelphia Chip Index

Hoarding is making it worse.

Like nervous shoppers raiding supermarket aisles for toilet paper ahead of a COVID-19 lockdown, manufacturers stockpiled computer chips during the pandemic.

Before that, ""just in time"" manufacturing was the norm for fiscally conservative companies, which ordered parts as close to production time as possible to avoid excess inventory, reduce warehouse capacity and cut upfront spending.

During the pandemic that shifted to what some jokingly call a ""just in case"" practice of stockpiling chips.

""Hoarding is a sign they think it's essential until one day they look at it and say, 'Why do I have all this inventory?'"" said Hutcheson, who has been forecasting chip supply and demand for over 40 years. ""It's kind of like toilet paper.""

The big chip U-turn has hit unevenly across business sectors, experts said.

Big suppliers of chips to consumer electronics makers, especially low-end smartphones, will be hit hardest by the downturn, said Tristan Gerra, Baird's senior analyst for semiconductors.

Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), the design giant whose graphic chips are used for gaming and mining cryptocurrency, could see ""another shoe drop"" as prices continue to fall, exacerbated by the recent cryptocurrency market crash, Gerra said.

Among those least affected by a glut are Apple Inc's suppliers such as the world's top chip factory Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW), said Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson. Demand remains high for Apple devices, which are more upmarket.

Chipmakers supplying automotive and data centers will also thrive, said Gerra, noting unabated demand.

""In power management, we're going gangbusters,"" said an executive of another global chipmaker who asked not to be identified.

However, for radio frequency chips used in smartphones, ""we're seeing a pullback because of handsets,"" he added.

The executive's chip factory is ""retooling"" production lines to make more power management chips for cars and fewer RF chips, which could eventually help relieve some of the auto chip shortages, he said.

While industry executives and analysts cannot say how many excess chips are in warehouses around the world, first-quarter inventory hit a record high at key electronics manufacturing services companies, said Jefferies' analyst Mark Lipacis in a July 1 note. The previous first-quarter record was over two decades ago, right before the dotcom bubble burst.

Manufacturers may decide to use up chips in warehouses instead of buying new ones, and cancel orders, Lipacis warned.

Auto chipmakers are safe for now, some analysts said. But that may not last long.

In his September note Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said automakers were ordering far more chips than they appeared to need, and that trend is continuing, he told Reuters.

That will create a problem when vehicle makers stop buying chips to use up their stockpiles.

Summary Law firms Lawyers for plaintiff Cydia at Quinn Emanuel said litigation would benefit from 9th Circuit's decision in Epic v. Apple

Apple lawyers at Gibson Dunn won bid for early 2024 trial















(Reuters) - Apple Inc won a bid on Monday in California federal court for an early 2024 jury trial in an App Store antitrust case, as a judge declined to hold up the litigation while a U.S. appeals court weighs a parallel lawsuit challenging the tech company's policies as anticompetitive.

Lawyers for Apple at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and attorneys for rival app store Cydia at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan were at odds over how quickly to press ahead in the case. Plaintiff SaurikIT LLC, which developed Cydia, alleged in 2020 the iPhone maker was violating competition law in the app distribution and payment processing markets.

Cydia's attorneys said the litigation would benefit from hearing from the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the blockbuster antitrust case Epic Games v Apple, which could be argued as soon as October. But U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, who oversaw that case and ruled largely last year for Apple, said on Monday she wanted the case to move ahead faster.

""If something happens that changes the landscape, just come back and talk to me. I'm not going to sit here and wait. [Epic's] case could go all the way to the Supreme Court,"" Gonzalez Rogers said. ""We're going to litigate based upon the current state of the law.""

She added: ""Shorter times make you focus. So, focus.""

A lawyer for Apple, Jay Srinivasan at Gibson Dunn, and an Apple representative on Tuesday did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

Cydia's lawyers David Nelson and Adam Wolfson at Quinn Emanuel did not immediately return similar messages.

The lawsuit ""seeks to open the markets for iOS app distribution and iOS app payment processing"" and ""to recover the enormous damages Apple caused Cydia."" Apple has denied any liability. Gonzalez Rogers in May declined to dismiss Cydia's amended lawsuit.

Wolfson had asked Gonzalez Rogers to allow certain depositions and other fact-finding to extend to June 2023, giving more time for the parties to hear from the 9th Circuit in the Epic case.

Srinivasan at Gibson Dunn said ""neither the parties nor the court can divine when an appellate decision will issue."" Apple opposed extending ""discovery"" to next June.

The 9th Circuit hasn't yet said when it will hear Epic's case. Apple's lawyers have said they prefer a hearing next year.

Gonzalez Rogers set Cydia's trial for March 25, 2024.

The case is SaurikIT LLC v. Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 4:20-cv-08733-YGR.

MOSCOW, July 12 (Reuters) - U.S. tech giant Apple (AAPL.O)and Zoom Video Communications (ZM.O) were fined on Tuesday for allegedly refusing to store the data of Russian citizens on Russian territory.

Moscow has clashed with Big Tech over content, censorship, data and local representation in a simmering dispute that has erupted into a full-on battle since Russia sent its armed forces into Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Apple was fined 2 million roubles ($34,000), the court in Moscow's Tagansky district said, with Zoom and Ookla, which runs the internet performance tool Speedtest, fined 1 million roubles each. Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google was ordered to pay 60,000 roubles for a different offence relating to data.

Apple, Zoom, Ookla and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ($1 = 59.0000 roubles)

260,466,APPLE,2022-07-12,Carl Pei's Nothing launches maiden smartphone,"













STOCKHOLM, July 12 (Reuters) - Swedish tech entrepreneur Carl Pei launched the first smartphone from his new company Nothing on Tuesday, hoping to crack a fiercely competitive market with new features.

Pei co-founded smartphone maker OnePlus in 2013 and made it a rival to Apple (AAPL.O) and Samsung by offering premium features at half the price, and becoming the top seller in several countries including India.

After leaving OnePlus in 2020, he founded Nothing last year with backing from the likes of Tony Fadell, designer of Apple's iPod, Twitch co-founder Kevin Lin and Reddit CEO Steve Huffman.

London-based Nothing says its smartphone offers 18 hours of use with every charge, and two days on standby, and that it can reach 50% power in just 30 minutes of charging. It says the phone also has an array of remote features including being able to unlock the doors of a Tesla car.

The phone is priced from 399 pounds ($470), with the company saying it is cheaper than premium phones with similar features and that there are over 200,000 pre-orders for it.

OnePlus used an invite-only strategy for selling smartphones that created high demand by keeping customers in a constant state of anticipation.

Following a similar strategy, Nothing held an auction in June for an initial 100 of the new phones, fetching bids of over $3,000, it said.

IDC's research director Navkendar Singh said Nothing will compete against phones from Samsung, Xiaomi (1810.HK), Oppo and Vivo but competition will be intense.

Gartner has revised down its forecast for global mobile phone sales this year to a decline of 7.1% from growth of 2.2%.

""The smartphone market is frighteningly competitive and is dominated by Apple and Samsung who have incredible resources,"" said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight.

""Add in the current macroeconomic situation and cost of living pressure and it means being successful will be a huge challenge.""

261,863,APPLE,2022-07-13,Buffett's Berkshire owns 19.2% of Occidental Petroleum after new purchases,"













July 13 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), run by billionaire Warren Buffett, said it has this week purchased another 4.3 million shares of Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N), giving it a 19.2% stake in the oil company.

In a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Wednesday, Berkshire said it spent about $250 million on the additional shares, and now owns 179.4 million Occidental common shares worth about $10.4 billion.

The latest purchases put Berkshire closer to 20% ownership, a threshold that would let it record its proportionate share of Occidental's earnings with its own results, known as the equity method of accounting.

Analysts on average expect Occidental's net income to exceed $10 billion this year, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S.

Berkshire uses the equity method for its 26.6% stake in Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), the packaged food company it controls with Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital.

Yet while Berkshire is by far Occidental's largest shareholder, it could contend that its accounting should remain unchanged because its stake is passive.

Berkshire also owns $10 billion of Occidental preferred stock that throws off $800 million of annual dividends, and has warrants to buy another 83.9 million common shares for $5 billion.

Occidental's share price has doubled this year, helped by rising oil prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Some analysts have speculated that Berkshire could buy all of the Houston-based company, which has been reducing debt since acquiring Anadarko Petroleum Corp for $35.7 billion in 2019.

Berkshire's preferred stock investment helped finance the Anadarko takeover.

In 2010, Berkshire bought the BNSF railroad for $26.5 billion after earlier accumulating a 22.6% stake.

Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns dozens of other businesses including the Geico car insurer and See's candies, and stocks including Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N).

262,167,APPLE,2022-07-13,"Apple hovers above competition even as smartphone market stumbles, sources say","













July 13 (Reuters) - The global smartphone market may be in the toilet, but the iPhone 13 continues to sell well, and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is expecting its upcoming iPhone 14 to do even better at launch.

Apple's slightly higher expectations for the forthcoming iPhone 14 underscore a growing belief among Wall Street analysts that the Cupertino, California company's sales are likely to hold up better than the broader smartphone industry if major economies enter a recession.

Apple, which reports its fiscal third quarter earnings on July 28, conveyed its expectations to suppliers in initial forecasts as it carries out trial production of the iPhone 14, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

With Apple sitting at the higher end of the market, analysts believe that inflation in core items like food and fuel have taken a lesser toll on its relatively affluent user base. That comes as industry watchers such as Fubon Securities Investment Services Co chairman Charles Hsiao believe demand for consumer electronics will slow overall this year and next.

An economic slowdown in China has already taken a huge bite out of the smartphone market, pulling global sales down 10% year over year to 96 million units in May, the most recent month for which full figures were available, according to Counterpoint Research. It's only the second time in nearly a decade that the monthly figure has slipped below 100 million handsets, the firm said.

But two iPhone supply chain sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters that iPhone sales have continued to do well in July despite signs of cooling market demand for other smartphone makers.

""Others are starting to take a hit,” one of the sources said.

The second source said July shipments for the iPhone 13 from one factory were a third higher than July last year. That pattern was especially unusual because sales of current iPhone models tend to slow down in July and August as consumers await new models that Apple traditionally releases in September.

“Judging by shipment, sales of iPhone 13 are fairly good,"" the second source said.

The iPhone has continued to sell well late into its cycle in part because ""China demand rebounded sharply after lockdowns ended and the iPhone was a beneficiary"" of a June shopping holiday in China, Cowen analyst Krish Sankar wrote in a note to clients.

In keeping with its annual schedule, Apple has started trial production of the iPhone 13's successor with the goal of ramping up mass production in August so the devices can start shipping in the fall. The initial shipment forecasts Apple has given suppliers is “slightly higher” than that of iPhone 13 a year ago, the second source said.

“It’s slightly higher than last year. It’s good, but not explosively good,"" the second source said.

For the just-ended fiscal third quarter, some Wall Street analysts are bracing for a slight decline in iPhone 13 shipments even if volumes are higher at some individual factories. But analysts still expect the iPhone to fare better than rivals. Cowen, for example, expects Apple handset shipments to be down about 1% for the just-ended quarter, while overall handset shipments could be down as much as 13%.

The divergence between Apple and the Android market is rippling through Apple's supply chain.

“For Samsung’s display unit, a better-than-expected performance in Q2 is expected due to shipments for iPhones, which is the only smartphone with strong sales,” said Song Myung-sup, analyst at HI Investment & Securities.

Cowen held steady its ""outperform"" rating on shares of chipmaker Skyworks Solutions Inc (SWKS.O), noting that it gets about 55% of its revenues from Apple for a radio chip in the iPhone. Skyworks rival Qorvo Inc (QRVO.O), by contrast, gets 30% of its revenue from Apple and has greater exposure to the Android phone market. Cowen downgraded Qorvo to ""market perform.""

""Skyworks’ greater relative exposure to Apple in its mobile business likely insulates the company in the near term from significant impacts associated with ... downward demand revisions,"" Cowen analyst Matt Ramsay wrote in a note to clients.

263,848,APPLE,2022-07-13,New Tsinghua Unigroup chairman promises fresh start for Chinese chip company,"













SHANGHAI, July 13 (Reuters) - The new chairman of embattled Chinese chip conglomerate Tsinghua Unigroup promised a ""new start"" for the company in an open letter to staff published on Wednesday.

In his first public comments since formally taking over Unigroup on Monday, Unigroup Chairman Li Bin wrote the company would begin its new era under his leadership by paying back its creditors and reducing its debt ratio.

After that, Li wrote, the company will ""go into battle"" by studying foreign and domestic competition.

Li criticised management under its previous owner, Zhao Weiguo, who drove the company into debt while building a conglomerate.

""The companies in the group are fighting each other and there is no resource sharing, collaborative management or synergies,"" Li wrote.

""While our scale is already large, our business achievements and quality levels are uneven.""

Tsinghua Unigroup said in a market filing late on Monday that it had completed a restructuring plan that officially placed it under the ownership of a vehicle controlled by Wise Road Capital, Jianguang Asset Management, and a number of state-affiliated funds.

Li controls both Jianguang and Wise Road Capital.

Wise Road was behind a failed $1.4 billion acquisition of U.S.-listed chipmaker Magnachip, which fell apart due to regulatory scrutiny.

Wise Road also negotiated the sale of Britain's Newport Wafer Fab to a Chinese buyer in 2021. In May, the British government ordered a national security review into the deal.

Originating as a branch of China's prestigious Tsinghua University, Tsinghua Unigroup emerged in the previous decade as a would-be domestic champion for China's laggard chip industry.

But the company fell into debt under former chairman Zhao, prompting it to default on a number of bond payments in late 2020 end eventually face bankruptcy.

The conglomerate has yet to produce any global leaders in the semiconductor sector. However, in recent years, two divisions have made promising advances.

Smartphone processor maker Unisoc has gained market share after Huawei's Hisilicon chip division collapsed due to U.S. Sanctions.

Memory chip maker Yangtze Memory Technologies Co Ltd (YMTC) may also supply NAND flash to Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Bloomberg reported. Neither company has confirmed the reports.

Summary Companies This content was produced in Russia where the law restricts coverage of Russian military operations in Ukraine















MOSCOW, July 14 (Reuters) - Russian consumer electronics retailer M.Video-Eldorado (MVID.MM) on Thursday said it had started selling discounted and used smartphones, offering Russian consumers cheaper alternatives as Western brands suspend shipments.

Apple (AAPL.O) paused all product sales in Russia in early March, one of many Western companies to distance itself from Moscow since it sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special military operation.

M.Video said the move expanded its available range of devices and that it was offering ""like new"" Apple products.

Given limited supply to the Russian market, M.Video said discounted, used electronics that are fully functional had the potential to offer an effective alternative to consumers seeking a flagship device.

M.Video is following in the footsteps of mobile operator MTS (MTSS.MM), which launched a similar venture in May. read more

265,869,APPLE,2022-07-14,Taiwan's Foxconn says is shareholder of troubled Chinese chip firm,"













TAIPEI, July 14 (Reuters) - Taiwan's Foxconn , the world's largest contract electronics maker, said on Thursday it was a shareholder in embattled Chinese chip conglomerate Tsinghua Unigroup via a 5.38 billion yuan ($798 million) investment by a subsidiary.

Foxconn, best known for assembling Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhone, is keen to make auto chips in particular as it expands into the electric vehicle market. The company has been seeking to acquire chip plants globally as a worldwide chip shortage rattles producers of goods from cars to electronics.

Foxconn said in a statement to the Taipei stock exchange that its China-listed unit Foxconn Industrial Internet Co Ltd (601138.SS) controlled 99% of a Chinese entity called Xingwei, which controls a 48.9% stake in a different entity that itself holds a 20% stake in the vehicle that owns all of Unigroup.

Foxconn Industrial said in March it had invested 9.8 billion yuan in Xingwei.

Speaking earlier on Thursday, an official at Taiwan's Economy Ministry, which has to approve large-scale investments in China, said they had been in contact with Foxconn and ""reminded them that the case needs to be reviewed before doing anything"".

Foxconn said it had handled the case ""in accordance with the rules"". It did not elaborate.

The island's government has become increasingly cautious about China's ambition to boost its semiconductor industry and has proposed new laws to prevent what it says is China stealing its chip technology, amid rising concern in Taipei that Beijing is stepping up its economic espionage.

Taipei prohibits companies from building their most advanced foundries in China to ensure they do not offshore their best technology.

Originating as a branch of China's prestigious Tsinghua University, Tsinghua Unigroup emerged in the previous decade as a would-be domestic champion for China's laggard chip industry.

266,888,APPLE,2022-07-15,Chipmaker TSMC's shares jump after quarterly profit beats estimates,"













TAIPEI, July 15 (Reuters) - TSMC (2330.TW) shares jumped 3.7% on Friday outperforming the broader market (.TWII), after the Taiwanese chipmaker announced forecast-beating second-quarter profit, with analysts buoyant on the firm's outlook despite some downside concern.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), a major Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier and the world's largest contract chipmaker, posted on Thursday a 76.4% leap in profit for the April-June period of 2022, to T$237.0 billion ($7.92 billion). read more

It said it was ""highly confident"" about its long-term prospects, though also signalled cooling demand from consumer electronics customers who it expects to reduce chip stockpiles over the next few quarters into 2023.

The market has been wary of a possible chip glut due to slowing consumer demand and soaring inflation, especially after Micron Technology Inc (MU.O) last month said a chip shortage in some sectors was quickly turning into a glut.

TSMC's earnings are likely to ease some of those worries for now.

Analysts at J.P. Morgan said TSMC acknowledging the downturn was a ""positive start"", expecting the chipmaker's stock price to move up modestly in the near term.

""But confirmation of downturn from other semi companies in this earnings season is necessary for a definitive clearing event.""

TSMC's shares are still down around 20% so far this year, in line with broader local market, as investors worry Taiwan's export-dependent economy will be hit by inflation and slowing consumer demand in China, the United States and Europe.

Morningstar analysts said they believed Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and Nvidia Corp's (NVDA.O) increased allocation to TSMC would have cushioned the impact of most of the overall softened demand for the next 12 months.

""We note that the duo has contracted TSMC as their primary foundry (if not sole) for most of 2023's consumer products because of low production yields at Samsung"" Electronics Co Ltd .

REUTERS/Mike Segar















TAIPEI, July 15 (Reuters) - Taiwanese prosecutors on Friday accused a Chinese Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier of stealing commercial secrets from a Taiwanese supplier and poaching its workforce to win orders from the U.S. company, saying it had charged 14 people.

Taiwan has been stepping up efforts to stop what it views as underhand and illegal activities by Chinese firms to steal know-how and poach away talent in what Taipei's government views as a threat to the island's tech prowess.

Prosecutors in New Taipei said after a year-and-a-half investigation they had found that China's Luxshare Precision Industry Co Ltd (002475.SZ) had targeted Taiwanese competitor Catcher Technology Co Ltd (2474.TW) ""in order to quickly enter the Apple production chain to win orders"".

Luxshare ""lured"" Catcher's China based research and development team with promises of high salaries and stole business secrets from the Taiwanese firm, causing them big losses, the prosecutors said in a statement.

Luxshare was doing this in order to be able to ""quickly build factories and mass produce cases for iPhones, iPads and other products"", the statement said.

Luxshare did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and neither did Apple.

New Taipei prosecutors have now charged 14 people in connection with the case for breach of trust and taking commercial secrets for use overseas, they added.

""The department will do its best to investigate such cases to maintain the sound development of our country's enterprises and ensure the competitiveness of national industries.""

Catcher, which makes iPhone and iPad cases, said in a statement it continues to implement and optimise the protection of trade secrets and intellectual property rights, and will investigate anything that infringes on its rights and interests.

The company is cooperating with the probe, it added.

In May, Taiwanese authorities raided 10 companies or their R&D centres operating in Taiwan without approval suspected of illegally poaching chip engineers and other tech talent. read more

Summary Companies This content was produced in Russia, where the law restricts coverage of Russian military operations in Ukraine.















MOSCOW, July 15 (Reuters) - Russian investors will have the right to ask foreign institutions holding their frozen securities to transfer depositary accounting rights to a Russian organisation, according to a law signed by President Vladimir Putin late on Thursday.

Around six trillion roubles ($105.1 billion) of foreign shares held by Russians have been frozen as a result of Western sanctions and Russia's own authorities and platforms restricting trading in foreign assets, the central bank has estimated.

Investors have the right to submit an application for the depositary accounting rights of its foreign-held shares to be transferred to a Russian entity within 90 days from the law's publication, the text of the law said.

Russia saw a boom in private investment in the years leading up to its decision in February to send armed forces into Ukraine, with foreign stocks such as Apple (AAPL.O) and Tesla popular among a growing army of retail investors.

Moscow's access to the international economic and global trading systems has been severely restricted as a result of the West's unprecedented sanctions.

Russia's leaders and the central bank are trying to shield the country from those restrictions, accelerating a de-dollarisation drive and encouraging Russians to store their assets domestically in roubles and through Russian securities in order to protect them from possible future sanctions.

Officials have said that the law could allows Russian holders of securities of Russian companies issued abroad, including sovereign Eurobonds, to exit from these assets.

July 19 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) purchased another 1.94 million shares of Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N), giving it an $11.4 billion stake and putting it nearer a threshold where it could record some of the oil company's earnings with its own.

Berkshire's latest purchases from July 14 to July 18 cost $112 million, and gave Buffett's conglomerate a 19.4% stake in Occidental, or 181.7 million shares, regulatory filings show.

If it reached 20% ownership, Berkshire could report its proportionate share of Houston-based Occidental's earnings, through the so-called equity method of accounting, potentially adding billions of dollars to annual profit.

Analysts on average expect Occidental to post about $10.7 billion of net income this year, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S.

Occidental shares closed up 4.6% at $62.82 on Tuesday. The share price has more than doubled this year, benefiting from rising oil prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire also has warrants to buy another 83.9 million Occidental shares for $5 billion.

It also owns $10 billion of Occidental preferred stock, which helped finance the 2019 purchase of Anadarko Petroleum and generates $800 million of annual dividends.

Berkshire uses the equity method of accounting for its 26.6% stake in packaged food company Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), which it controls with Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital.

Though some analysts and investors have speculated that Berkshire could eventually buy all of Occidental, Berkshire could contend that its accounting should remain unchanged because its stake is passive. read more

Berkshire also owns dozens of companies, including the BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance and several energy companies, and stocks including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Bank of America Corp and another oil company, Chevron Corp (CVX.N).

270,382,APPLE,2022-07-18,Antitrust veteran at plaintiffs' firm Hausfeld leaves for DOJ,"Summary

Summary Law firms Bonny Sweeney served prominent roles suing major tech companies

Departure marks more than 25 years of private plaintiffs' side work















(Reuters) - Bonny Sweeney, a co-leader of the antitrust practice at Hausfeld in San Francisco who has built cases against major U.S. tech companies is leaving the plaintiffs' firm to join the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust trial team.

Sweeney, who has brought antitrust lawsuits against Alphabet Inc's Google, Apple Inc and against major credit card companies, confirmed her departure plans to Reuters on Friday. She will join the Justice Department after spending more than 25 years on the plaintiffs' side in private practice.

She arrived at Hausfeld in 2015 from San-Diego based Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, where she was a partner since its founding in 2004, and has co-led Hausfeld's antitrust team, a leading practice at the firm, for four years.

Her hiring at the Justice Department comes at a key moment, amid several high-profile antitrust lawsuits with others potentially in the pipeline. Bloomberg News said on July 14 the DOJ was expected to file a lawsuit within weeks against Google over its online advertising market dominance.

A Google representative on Monday didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment, but the company told Reuters last week it was trying to address regulators' concerns.

A Justice Department spokesperson on Monday did not immediately comment. Sweeney did not immediately comment further about her move.

Sweeney's departure marks at least the second plaintiffs' lawyer in San Francisco to join the Justice Department's antitrust team in recent weeks. Last month, Aaron Sheanin from Robins Kaplan jumped to the DOJ as an antitrust trial attorney.

Sheanin did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

Hausfeld antitrust co-chair Scott Martin called Sweeney a ""known quantity of terrific intelligence, capability and integrity.""

Sweeney recently had served as co-lead class counsel for app developers suing Google in an antitrust case over the operation of its Google Play store. Google on June 30 said it had agreed to pay $90 million to resolve the developers' claims.

In earlier antitrust litigation, Sweeney was on the lead plaintiffs' team at trial against Apple in 2014 over its iTunes digital store. A jury sided with the tech company. She represented retailers in a 2012 multibillion-dollar settlement involving claims that Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc fixed credit and debit card fees.

Summary

Summary Companies Bank stocks give up early gains

Dollar dips on Fed hike view

Oil jumps on Russian supply worries















NEW YORK, July 18 (Reuters) - A gauge of global stocks edged higher on Monday as a late-session sell-off in U.S. equities trimmed earlier gains while the dollar slipped as investors tamped down expectations that the Federal Reserve will take a more aggressive approach in hiking interest rates next week.

Expectations for a 100 basis points rate hike by the Fed at its policy meeting next week stood at about 29%, according to CME's FedWatch Tool after reaching as high as 80% last week.

Recent readings on inflation came in above expectations but showed tentative signs that higher prices may be starting to ease, giving the U.S. central bank a possible cushion to raise rates at a smaller 75 basis points increment.

""As we as we entered into the quiet period, the Fed seems to be leaning more towards 75 basis points than to 100 basis points,"" said Jim Barnes, director of fixed income at Bryn Mawr Trust.

""The more recent economic data that we got on Friday was more upbeat and today's rising Treasury yields seem to be catching up with the market's activity from Friday, as well as the equity market from today.""

A strong start to the trading session for stocks on Wall Street fizzled out, however, as a drop in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) weighed following a Bloomberg report that the iPhone maker plans to slow hiring and spending growth next year in some units to cope with a potential economic downturn. read more

""We were starting to slide a little before then, just a little bit, and when that hit, obviously Apple slid a little quicker than the market did, so maybe it was an excuse to sell off,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.

U.S. equities initially rose in part due to gains in bank stocks (.SPXBK), which had risen about 3% on the heels of earnings from Goldman Sachs (GS.N), up 2.5% and Bank of America, up 0.05%, before fading. read more

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 216.51 points, or 0.69%, to 31,071.75; the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 32.34 points, or 0.84%, to 3,830.82; and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 92.37 points, or 0.81%, to 11,360.05.

Of the 40 S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings through Monday morning, 80% have been above estimates, per Refinitiv data, tracking slightly below the 81% rate over the past four quarters.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index (.STOXX) rose 0.93% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (.MIWD00000PUS) gained 0.06%. European stocks closed off a three-week high hit earlier in the day on worries about the impact of an energy shortage in the region. read more

Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last fell 12/32 in price to yield 2.9725%, from 2.93% late on Friday.

Before the Fed meeting next week, the European Central Bank is poised to raise rates for the first time in more than a decade on Thursday, with a hike of 25 basis points expected.

As the region deals with its own inflationary pressures, Russia's Gazprom (GAZP.MM) told customers in Europe it cannot guarantee gas supplies because of 'extraordinary' circumstances, according to a letter from Gazprom that will add to European fears of fuel shortages. read more

In light of the shifting view of next week's Fed meeting, the U.S. dollar retreated from the 20-year high hit last week, helping the euro move away from parity against the greenback. read more

The dollar index fell 0.38%, with the euro up 0.56% to $1.0143.

272,448,APPLE,2022-07-18,"Pegasus phone spyware used to target 30 Thai activists, cyber watchdogs say","













BANGKOK, July 18 (Reuters) - At least 30 political activists in Thailand have been hacked using Israeli surveillance spyware Pegasus, according to a joint investigation by human rights and cyber monitoring groups, which suspect the attacks were launched locally.

The probe by Thai human rights group iLaw, Southeast Asian internet watchdog Digital Reach and Toronto-based Citizen Lab, followed a mass alert from Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in November informing thousands of iPhone users, including in Thailand, that they were targets of ""state-sponsored attackers"". read more

Pegasus has been used by governments to spy on journalists, activists, and dissidents and the Israeli firm behind it, NSO Group, has been sued by Apple and placed on a U.S. trade blacklist.

iLaw in its report on Monday said 24 political activists, three academics and three members of civil society groups were targeted between October 2020 and November 2021, ranging from one to 14 hacking incidents each.

Yingcheep Atchanont, programme manager at iLaw, was among those hacked and said his group would investigate further, and pursue legal action once it becomes clear who in Thailand was operating Pegasus.

""NSO has said that they only sell the software to governments and that all the victims here are Thai government critics, so they benefited the most,"" he said.

NSO Group and a spokesperson for Thailand's government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Wetang Phuangsup, a spokesperson for Thailand's ministry of Digital Economy and Society, said his ministry was not aware of any usage of spyware by the government.

Citizen Lab's report, which was separate to that of iLaw, examined digital traces left in the victims' phones and identified Pegasus usage in Thailand as far back as May 2014.

John Scott-Railton, a Citizen Lab researcher, said the investigation showed Pegasus was being operated in Thailand, with many more hacking victims likely.

""What we uncovered is a lot of targeting of dozens of people over a specific time frame, but having done investigation into Pegasus... over the decade, I am confident that it is the tip of the iceberg,"" he said in an online presentation on Monday.

July 18 (Reuters) - SoftBank (9984.T) has put on hold plans for a London initial public offering of the British chip technology firm Arm Ltd because of the political turmoil in the UK government, the Financial Times reported on Monday.

The departures of investment minister Gerry Grimstone and digital minister Chris Philp, following the collapse of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government earlier this month, have led SoftBank to pause discussions about Arm's UK listing next year, the FT reported, citing people briefed on the talks.

They had both played leading roles in talks with the Japanese tech investor, the FT reported, adding that the turmoil could pave the way for SoftBank to pursue a more straightforward U.S. listing. (https://on.ft.com/3zfmYen)

Arm and the UK government declined to comment, while SoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

SoftBank's billionaire founder, Masayoshi Son, had told shareholders in June that he was in favor of a U.S. listing as most of Arm's clients are based there. read more

SoftBank acquired Cambridge, England-based Arm for $32 billion in 2016 and struck a blockbuster deal four years later to sell it to Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O). The deal was, however, shelved due to regulatory hurdles.

Arm supplies the intellectual property in chips that power most of the world's smartphones, including those from Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS).

July 18 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) was sued on Monday in a proposed class action by payment card issuers accusing the iPhone maker of abusing its market power in mobile devices to thwart competition for its Apple Pay mobile wallet.

According to a complaint filed in San Francisco federal court, Apple ""coerces"" consumers who use its smartphones, smart watches and tablets into using its own wallet for contactless payments, unlike makers of Android-based devices that let consumers choose wallets such as Google Pay and Samsung Pay.

The plaintiff, Iowa's Affinity Credit Union, said Apple's anticompetitive conduct forces the more than 4,000 banks and credit unions that use Apple Pay to pay at least $1 billion of excess fees annually for the privilege.

It also said Apple's conduct minimizes the incentive for the Cupertino, California-based company to make Apple Pay work better and make it more resistant to security breaches.

""Apple's conduct harms not only issuers, but also consumers and competition as a whole,"" the complaint said.

The lawsuit seeks unspecified triple damages, and a halt to Apple's alleged anticompetitive conduct.

Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The company already faces a possible heavy fine after European Union regulators on May 2 said it had abused its dominance in iOS devices and mobile wallets by refusing to give payment rivals access to its technology. read more

According to the complaint, Apple charges issuers a 0.15% fee on credit transactions and a flat 0.5 cent fee on debit transactions using Apple Pay, while Android-based rivals charge nothing.

The plaintiff is represented by the law firms Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro and Sperling & Slater.

Last August, they helped obtain a $100 million settlement for smaller iOS developers that claimed Apple overcharged them on commissions. read more

The case is Affinity Credit Union v Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-04174.

275,230,APPLE,2022-07-18,"Apple to slow hiring, spending for some teams next year, Bloomberg News reports","













July 18 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) plans to slow hiring and spending growth next year in some units to cope with a potential economic downturn, Bloomberg News reported on Monday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

The potential move would see Apple - the world's most valuable company - join a growing pool of American corporations including Meta Platforms (META.O) and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) in slowing hiring.

Apple shares reversed course to trade down 1.6% at $147.6. The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The Bloomberg report said the changes would not affect all teams and that Apple was still planning an aggressive product launch schedule in 2023 that includes a mixed-reality headset, its first major new category since 2015.

""Apple's move reflects a broader slowdown in investing in new things, new companies and new products,"" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh. ""It signifies that inflation is an issue for these companies.""

Fears have risen in recent months that aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to tame an unabating surge in inflation could tip the economy into a recession. The price pressures have also raised worries that customers could curb spending on discretionary items like smartphones. read more

Smartphone shipments declined 9% in the second quarter, according to data from Canalys. Still, Apple's iPhones remain among the most sold phones in the world, with the company holding a 17% market share just behind market leader Samsung, the data showed.

Apple typically launches a new version of its iPhone and other wearable products in September ahead of the busy holiday season.

As of its last annual report, the Cupertino, California-based company had about 154,000 full-time equivalent employees.

Bank stocks erase gains to close down















July 18 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower on Monday after bank stocks erased earlier gains and Apple (AAPL.O) shares fell on a report saying the company plans to slow hiring and spending growth next year.

After posting solid gains to start the session following earnings from Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), the S&P financial sector (.SPSY) weakened into the close.

Apple shares reversed course to close down 2.1% at $147.1 on a Bloomberg report that said the company plans to slow hiring and spending growth next year in some units to cope with a potential economic downturn. read more

Nine of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 lost ground, with healthcare (.SPXHC) and utilities (.SPLRCU) suffering the largest percentage drop, while energy (.SPNY) took the biggest gain.

Earnings from big technology companies next week will be closely watched, after their shares came under immense selling pressure through much of this year.

Among other tech stocks, Google parent Alphabet fell 2.5%. IBM declined 1.3%.

Summary Companies For poll data click:

Orders median forecast +5.6% y/y (prior month +6%)

Data due Wednesday, July 20, 4:00 p.m. (0800 GMT)















TAIPEI, July 19 (Reuters) - Taiwan's export orders likely grew for a second consecutive month in June after falling for the first time in two years in April, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday, supported by demand for technology products.

The median forecast from a poll of 16 economists expects export orders to rise 5.6% from a year ago. Forecasts ranged for an expansion of between 1.2% and 9.3%.

The island's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, unexpectedly fell 5.5% from a year earlier to $51.9 billion in April, taking a larger-than-expected hit from COVID-19 lockdowns in China and broader global supply chain disruptions.

But they returned to growth in May, expanding a better-than-expected 6% to $55.43 billion.

The government has predicted June orders to be between 3.3% and 6.1% higher than a year before.

Taiwan's export orders are a leading indicator of demand for hi-tech gadgets and Asian exports, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months.

The island's manufacturers, including the world's largest contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW), , are a key part of the global supply chain for technology giants including Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

The data for June will be released on Wednesday.

July 19 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co said on Tuesday Alex Gorsky, former chief executive officer of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), has been elected as a director of the bank.

Gorsky had helped establish J&J as a major player in the rare diseases market and led the development of the healthcare giant's first single-shot COVID-19 vaccine.

As CEO, Gorsky also had to steer the company through some high-profile crises, including allegations that its Baby Powder contained cancer-causing asbestos and litigation that alleged it contributed to the opioid epidemic in the United States.

Gorsky, currently an executive chairman at J&J, had handed over the reins in January this year after almost a decade at the role.

LONDON, July 19 (Reuters) - Google (GOOGL.O) faces a London trial over an estimated 920-milion-pound ($1.1 billion) damages claim after a court authorised a lawsuit that alleges the Alphabet-owned tech giant overcharged 19.5 million customers for app store purchases.

The class action, which was certified by the Competition Appeal Tribunal on Monday, alleges Google abused its dominant position by charging up to 30% commission on popular apps on its Play Store, including Roblox, Candy Crush Saga and Tinder since October 2015.

A detailed judgment has yet to be published, a spokesperson for the claimant group said on Tuesday.

Google did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

Regulators, rivals and consumer champions are trying to curb Big Tech, filing lawsuits across the globe against the likes of Google and rival Apple (AAPL.O) over alleged anti-competitive behaviour. The European Union alone has fined Google more than 8 billion euros ($8.2 billion) in recent years over anti-trust practices.

The latest British case against Google, which is not expected to come to trial before 2024, is brought by Liz Coll, a former digital policy manager at the non-profit Citizens Advice service. She is being advised by law firm Hausfeld.

Coll alleges in the lawsuit that the Play Store commission is unlawful and unjustifiable, breaching European and British competition laws, and that Google is abusing its dominant position at the expense of British Android smartphone and tablet users.

Google generated $11.2 billion in revenue from its mobile app store in 2019, a court filing unsealed last year showed.

280,854,APPLE,2022-07-19,U.S. senator seeks passage of Big Tech antitrust bill as time runs short,"













WASHINGTON, July 19 (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional leader on antitrust, Senator Amy Klobuchar, on Tuesday called for Congress to pass a bill to rein in Big Tech, as prospects of it becoming law seemed to be dimming.

Supporters have been pressing Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to schedule a vote on the bill that would ban self-preferencing by Big Tech platforms like Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google. Klobuchar, a lead sponsor along with Republican Chuck Grassley, has said she has the 60 votes required to pass the measure. read more

""We must pass legislation to put rules of the road in place for dominant tech companies,"" Klobuchar said in a statement Tuesday. ""These platforms use their dominance to unfairly disadvantage their rivals, all at the expense of competition and consumers.""

She is expected to give a speech on the Senate floor Tuesday evening on the Big Tech antitrust bill and related matters.

Schumer said Tuesday his emphasis was on a bill to boost chip manufacturing, and on judicial confirmations. Asked about antitrust bills, he said: ""I'm working with Senator Klobuchar. I support these bills. ... We have to see that we have 60 votes.""

The Senate has three weeks, including this one, before its scheduled August recess. When lawmakers return in September, expectations are that the focus will be on November midterm elections.

There has been discussion of considering Klobuchar's bill along with another bipartisan measure that addresses Apple (AAPL.O) and Google's control of their app stores.

Several bills to regulate the tech industry have been proposed, and experts thought these two antitrust bills had the best chance of passing this year because of bipartisan outrage over big tech companies. Democrats are worried about antitrust concerns while Republicans have accused tech platforms of stifling conservative voices.

An opponent of the measure said on Tuesday that it was ""highly unlikely"" to become law this year. Supporters disagree, and have continued to lobby for the anti-Big Tech measures.

July 19 (Reuters) - Russia's competition authority said on Tuesday it would fine U.S. tech giant Apple for violating Russian antitrust laws and abusing its dominant position in the app store market.

The federal anti-monopoly service (FAS) said it would levy a turnover-based fine against Apple, the size of which would be determined during the course of an administrative investigation.

Moscow has long objected to foreign tech platforms' influence in the Russian market, but the simmering dispute has escalated since Russia invaded Ukraine in February.

""The company has abused its dominant position in the iOS app distribution market,"" the FAS said in a statement.

""Apple prohibits iOS app developers from telling clients inside the app about the possibility of paying for purchases outside the App Store or using alternative payment methods.""

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Moscow has hit Western firms with a string of fines for violating internet laws that critics say are an attempt by the Kremlin to exert more control over the online space.

They include rules to store customer data on Russian servers, delete content upon request by Russia's communications regulator and open local offices in the country.

The decision to move against Apple on antitrust grounds echoes the European Commission's high-profile pursuit of the company for what it has called a ""closed ecosystem"" that ""unfairly shielded"" Apple from competition.

After initially hitting firms with fines in the tens or hundreds of thousands, Russia is significantly ramping up its financial penalties. On Monday, Russia fined Google $370 million for what it says were repeated refusals to remove content. read more

July 19 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) agreed to pay $50 million to settle a class-action lawsuit by customers who claimed it knew and concealed that the ""butterfly"" keyboards on its MacBook laptop computers were prone to failure.

The proposed preliminary settlement was filed late Monday night in the federal court in San Jose, California, and requires a judge's approval.

Customers claimed that MacBook, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro keyboards suffered from sticky and unresponsive keys, and that tiny amounts of dust or debris could make it difficult to type.

They also said Apple's service program was inadequate because the Cupertino, California-based company often provided replacement keyboards with the same problems.

The settlement covers customers who bought MacBook, MacBook Air and most MacBook Pro models between 2015 and 2019 in seven U.S. states: California, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, New York and Washington.

Apple denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. It did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment

Lawyers for the customers expect maximum payouts of $395 to people who replaced multiple keyboards, $125 to people who replaced one keyboard, and $50 to people who replaced key caps.

Customers also remain eligible for four years of free keyboard repairs following their purchases.

The customers' law firms, Girard Sharp LLP and Chimicles Schwartz Kriner & Donaldson-Smith LLP, may seek up to $15 million for legal fees, which would be deducted from the $50 million settlement fund, court papers show.

The case is In re: MacBook Keyboard Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-02813.

BRUSSELS, July 19 (Reuters) - Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google said it will from Tuesday cut fees to 12%, from 15%, for non-gaming app developers on its Google Play App Store which switch to rival payment systems, as it moves to comply with new EU tech rules.

The world's most popular internet search engine said the fee cut applies only to European consumers while the freedom to use another payment system will eventually be expanded to gaming apps as well.

The move underscores a change in Google's strategy since last year where it now prefers to bow to regulatory and antitrust pressure with offers of concessions rather than embark on lengthy and distracting fights.

The EU rules known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which will come into force next year, require tech giants to allow app developers to use rival payment platforms for app sales or risk fines of as much as 10% of their global turnover.

Apple and Google are the most affected by this requirement.

""As part of our efforts to comply with these new rules, we are announcing a new programme to support billing alternatives for EEA (European Economic Area ) users,"" Estelle Werth, Google's director for EU government affairs and public policy, said in a blogpost.

""This will mean developers of non-gaming apps can offer their users in the EEA an alternative to Google Play's billing system when they are paying for digital content and services,” she said.

The EEA includes the 27 EU countries, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.

""When a consumer uses an alternative billing system, the service fee the developer pays will be reduced by 3%,"" Werth said.

""Since 99% of developers currently qualify for a service fee of 15% or less, those developers would pay a service fee of 12% or lower based on transactions through alternative billing for EEA users acquired through the Play platform.""

Critics say the fees charged by Apple (AAPL.O) and Google at their mobile app stores are needlessly high and cost developers collectively billions of dollars a year, underscoring the two companies' monopoly power.

Google has been hit with more than 8 billion euros in EU antitrust fines in the last decade for anti-competitive practices related to its price comparison service, Android mobile operating system and advertising service.

285,12,APPLE,2022-07-20,Apple outlines health technology strategy in new report,"













July 20 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Wednesday released a report outlining a two-pronged strategy in digital health markets, courting consumers with health and fitness features on one hand while engaging with traditional healthcare systems on the other.

Spearheaded by Apple's chief operating officer, Jeff Williams, the report is the first time Apple has offered a comprehensive view of its approach to healthcare markets in the eight years since it began releasing health features such as a medical records storage system on iPhones. It has also started partnering with institutions such the Stanford University School of Medicine to conduct large-scale formal medical studies.

Much of the work has centered around the Apple Watch, a device that Williams played a key role in bringing to market and which contains sensors for heart health and other functions.

In the report, Apple said its focus for consumers is on providing a secure place for users to store their health and medical information on iPhones while using tools like the Apple Watch to warn and nudge users toward better health. The device can alert people to heart irregularities and detect when a person takes a hard fall to alert an emergency contact, among other features. Apple said its system can now store 150 different types of health data that is encrypted so that only users, not Apple, can access it.

The company also outlined work it is doing with medical researchers to allow them to use Apple devices to conduct studies, as well as allow patients to share and discuss data collected by Apple devices so that they can monitor their health better between doctor's visits.

Williams wrote in the report that Apple intends to keep developing health-related features for both users and the healthcare industry.

""Our vision for the future is to continue to create science-based technology that equips people with even more information and acts as an intelligent guardian for their health, so they’re no longer passengers on their own health journey,"" Williams wrote.

286,512,APPLE,2022-07-20,"Thailand admits to using phone spyware, cites national security","













BANGKOK, July 20 (Reuters) - A Thai minister has admitted the country uses surveillance software to track individuals in cases involving national security or drugs, amid revelations that government critics' phones had been hacked using the Israeli-made Pegasus spyware.

Minister of Digital Economy and Society, Chaiwut Thanakamanusorn, said in parliament late on Tuesday that he is aware of Thai authorities using spyware in ""limited"" cases but did not specify which government agency used such software, which programme was used or which individuals targeted.

Human rights groups have accused successive Thai governments of using broad definitions of national security as a pretext to prosecute or suppress activities of their main rivals.

A joint investigation by Thai human rights group iLaw, Southeast Asian internet watchdog Digital Reach and Toronto-based Citizen Lab highlighted on Monday the use of Pegasus spyware on at least 30 government critics between October, 2020 to November, 2021. read more

The probe followed a mass alert from Apple Inc. (AAPL.O) in November informing thousands of users of its iPhones, including in Thailand, that they were targets of ""state-sponsored attackers"". read more

Chaiwut did not name Pegasus but said that he is aware of spyware being used to ""listen into or access a mobile phone to view the screen, monitor conversations and messages"". But he added his ministry does not have the legal authority to use such software and did not specify which government agency does.

""It is used on national security or drug matters. If you need to arrest a drug dealer you have to listen in to find where the drop would be,"" he said.

""I understand that there was usage of this sort but it is very limited and only in special cases.""

His ministry has previously denied any knowledge of the matter.

The most recent alleged use of the spyware comes after the emergence of a youth-led movement in late 2020 that challenged the country's powerful monarchy and the government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha. More than 1,800 people have faced security-related charges since the movement began.

Thai police in a statement denied the use of Pegasus for surveillance or breaches of privacy.

Pegasus has been used by governments to spy on journalists, activists, and dissidents and the Israeli firm behind it, NSO Group, has been sued by Apple and placed on a U.S. trade blacklist.

NSO Group did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment on Monday or Wednesday.

BRUSSELS, July 20 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are set to beef up an investigation into Apple (AAPL.O), triggered by Spotify (SPOT.N), with new evidence but not new charges, in the hope of speeding up the case, people familiar with the matter said.

The European Commission last year told the iPhone maker that its App Store rules, which require developers to use its own in-app payment system and also prevent them from informing users of other purchasing options, distorts competition in the music streaming market. read more

Apple found itself in the European Commission's crosshairs after Spotify had complained that the U.S. tech company unfairly restricted rivals to its own music streaming service Apple Music on iPhones.

The EU competition enforcer set out its charges in a so-called statement of objections or charge sheet.

The watchdog subsequently considered sending a supplementary statement of objections, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this year.

Such documents usually lay out new charges or changes to the original charges. read more

The Commission is now expected to send a letter of facts to Apple instead, other people familiar with the matter said, adding that there was no final decision yet.

A letter of fact typically contains new evidence reinforcing the original charges against companies which can then counter with a written submission.

The Commission declined to comment.

Apple, which risks a fine as much as 10% of its global turnover if found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules, did not respond to emailed requests and phone calls for comment.

The company was hit with another EU antitrust charge in May related to its mobile payment system Apple Pay. read more

The alleged practices in both cases will be illegal under new EU tech rules known as the Digital Markets Act that will come into force next year with penalties as high as 10% of a company's global turnover.

July 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street is bracing for the slowest global revenue growth in the history of the social media sector, as intensifying competition from TikTok and Apple in advertising threaten to compound economic woes in the second quarter.

The dour expectations come after a blowout 2021, when social media ad sales in the United States grew 36% to reach $58 billion as brands increased marketing budgets to recover from the pandemic and reach customers online.

But social media platforms have since warned investors and employees that the tide is turning as inflation lingers around 40-year highs, an environment where brands spend less on advertising.

Meta Platforms (META.O) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told employees last month the company was slashing hiring plans and that ""this might be one of the worst downturns that we've seen in recent history."" read more

Snap Inc (SNAP.N), which owns Snapchat and is due to report earnings after the close, earlier said it expected to miss its own quarterly revenue forecast due to deteriorating economic conditions. read more

Global social media ad sales are now expected to grow by 11%, the slowest pace on record, according to media intelligence firm MAGNA, which downgraded the growth forecast from 18%.

Analysts had expected some degree of slowing growth after 2021. However, growing competition from viral short-form video app TikTok and Apple has created a ""perfect storm"" and ""investors are rightfully wary"" about digital ad growth this year, wrote Barclays analysts in a research note this month.

Apple had already upended the digital ad industry when it introduced new iPhone privacy controls last year that hurt the ability for companies like Meta and Snap to target and measure ads on their apps.

Apple's own advertising business, which mostly consists of developers paying to promote their app on the App Store, is expected to grow 36% this year to $6.9 billion, Barclays wrote, adding that Apple and TikTok together will take 34% of every new ad dollar that is spent outside China this year.

Lior Eldan, chief operating officer of mobile app marketing agency Moburst, which has worked with brands like Uber and Reddit, said clients are now spending about two to three times more on Apple ads, in part because the effectiveness of ads on other platforms has been degraded by Apple's privacy changes.

""We've seen dramatic increases in budgets on Apple search ads following the privacy changes,"" he said.

While still much smaller than behemoths like Facebook and YouTube, TikTok is poised to grow over 200% to become a $12 billion business, Barclays wrote.

TikTok remains important for many clients' advertising strategies, said Yvonne Williams, vice president of media at ad agency Code3, which has worked with brands like Gap and Dior.

Alphabet's Google, which reports second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, is the company most likely to be shielded from negative effects, because Google Search is ""mission critical"" for many advertisers, analysts from RBC Capital Markets said in a note on Tuesday.

Meta, Snap and Pinterest are more exposed to the Apple privacy changes and competition from TikTok, Barclays said.

ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast, July 22 (Reuters) - Global media and music brands are racing to claim a stake in Africa's music market as internet and smartphone penetration popularize artists and genres far beyond Africa's borders.

Companies are taking note of global interest, with Universal Music Group (UMG.AS)launching Virgin Music Africa Label & Artist Servicesin June for independent African labels and artists. The service will digitise out-of-print music catalogues to tap into the growing market for the sounds and chart-toppers of the continent.

Music streaming platforms including Spotify (SPOT.N), Apple Music and Boomplay are also entering the market with dedicated and expanded offerings and services.

The interest from global companies is coming as African artists headline festivals and concerts such as, Afro Nation in Portugal and Africolor in France and genres including Afrobeat, Rhumba and Amapiano are topping charts.

Franck-Alcide Kacou, managing director of Universal Music Africa and the new Virgin Music Africa Label, said it has over 15,000 music titles, 50 partner labels and around 100 artists from 25 countries.

The artists include Senegal's M'balax maestro Youssou Ndour, Congo's Lokua Kanza, Magic System from Ivory Coast and Cabo Snoop from Angola.

Kacou added that the service will digitize and distribute African music currently in vinyl, cassette or CD formats to reach today's younger audience.

""It's a real opportunity for countries that are also experiencing this digital transformation to integrate all this heritage into the cultural offer that is made on platforms,"" Kacou told Reuters in Abidjan.

He said the service will support independent labels in digital distribution who are looking for a wider network.

""Finding a producer on the continent and distributing cultural works is a real challenge for many talents, most of whom do not receive fair remuneration for their musical works,"" Kacou said.

REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha















BANGKOK, July 22 (Reuters) - A Thai minister on Friday sought to walk back remarks before parliament that authorities had used spyware to monitor individuals, U-turning on his admission just days earlier that surveillance software was actively being used.

Under questioning on Tuesday from opposition lawmakers alleging use of Israeli-made Pegasus spyware, Digital Economy and Society Minister Chaiwut Thanakamanusorn said he was aware surveillance software was being used, for national security and drug-related cases. read more

But in an about-face on the final day of the debate, Chaiwut said his comments were general observations not specifically about Thailand.

""I said I knew of the system that is used on security and drug (suppression) but I did not say that it existed in the Thai government,"" Chaiwut told parliament of Friday.

Thai authorities have come under pressure following a joint investigation by a Thai human rights group and two international tech firms that concluded Pegasus was used to hack phones of at least 30 Thai political activists and government critics, going back to 2014. read more

Pegasus has been used by governments to spy on journalists, activists, and dissidents and its creator NSO Group has been sued by Apple and placed on a U.S. trade blacklist.

NSO group has yet to respond to Reuters questions on the Thailand allegations.

The Thai Opposition Move Forward party alleged in parliament that one of its lawmakers and two former legislators had also been hacked using Pegasus.

But Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who came to power in a coup in 2014, on Friday rejected allegations that Pegasus had been used, saying there was no need to waste state budget on it.

The police earlier this week denied using Pegasus, while deputy defense minister Chaichan Chanmongkol said there was no such use of spyware by the military.

291,738,APPLE,2022-07-22,Take Five: It's a Fed hot summer,"













July 22 - A likely second straight 75 basis point rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve will keep markets on their toes in the week ahead, just as investors digest a wave of earnings from corporate America and Europe.

The prospect of early elections in Italy after the collapse of the government means there's plenty of political drama too, and Australia's latest inflation numbers may add to pressure on the country's central bank to get ahead of the curve.

Here's your week ahead in markets from Ira Iosebashvili in New York, Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, and Sujata Rao, Dhara Ranasinghe and Vincent Flasseur in London.

1/ FED HOT

Fed officials have poured cold water over expectations for a 100 basis point rate hike in July but Wednesday's meeting will still have drama aplenty. read more

A 75 bps interest rate hike is priced in, and coming on top of 150 bps worth of tightening so far in this cycle, that is sure to bite consumers and businesses. read more

Investors will be looking at whether the Fed thinks inflation is peaking and how it views the U.S. economy, as they try to gauge the scope of a September rate move.

Hanging in the balance are nascent rallies in U.S. stocks and bonds. The S&P 500 is up almost 10% from its mid-June low (.SPX), 10-year Treasury yields are down 60 bps .

2/ EARNINGS: PART I

Earnings from Google-parent Alphabet, Microsoft, Coca Cola, Apple and others will show how well corporate America is coping with soaring inflation and a strong dollar.

This year's 17% decline in the S&P 500 has lowered the index's forward price-to-earnings ratio to around 17.3 from 21.7 at the start of 2022, closer to the market's historic average of 15.5, according to Refinitiv Datastream. read more

While there have been several notable beats this season, it's early days and many worry that earnings estimates may not hold up in the face of the highest inflation in four decades and tightening financial conditions. read more

Also clouding the picture is the burgeoning dollar, which makes U.S. exports less competitive and hurts firms earning much of their money abroad. Alphabet, Microsoft and Coca Cola report on July 26, Apple and Amazon on July 28. read more

3/ EARNINGS: PART II

One-sixth of Europe's STOXX 600 equity index reports second-quarter results July 25-29, and Refinitiv I/B/E/S forecasts earnings to have grown 22% year-on-year.

That headline figure masks disparities; earnings growth at energy firms basking in the glow of $100-a-barrel oil is seen at 185%, while real estate businesses will show a 70% drop, Refinitiv predicts.

Statements from retailers, heavy industry and hospitality firms may show how much pain is being inflicted by energy shortages and high inflation. The likes of Airbus, Volkswagen and Mercedes will cast light on the state of European exporters.

Bank earnings, expected to have slowed around 16%, include numbers from UBS, Credit Suisse, Deutsche, Barclays and BNP Paribas.

The Q2 season will show if European shares are correctly valued around 11.5 times forward earnings, versus their 14% long-term average, or need to cheapen further.

4/ MAMMA MIA

A political crisis couldn't come at a worse moment for Italy. The ECB has just jacked up rates for the first time since 2011, inflation is soaring and the country has been hit hard by its exposure to Russian gas read more .

The collapse of Mario Draghi's government ends months of stability, unnerving markets that had cheered when the ex-ECB chief became prime minister in 2021. They now worry about the prospect of new elections and Rome's ability to pass policies.

It also leaves the ECB, with its new tool to contain stress in bond markets, in an awkward position of determining which part of government bond spread widening is ""unwarranted"" - or giving up buying Italy's bonds altogether. read more

5/ CREDIBILITY ISSUE

Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) boss Philip Lowe is pledging a steady policy-tightening campaign to at least double interest rates from current levels to ""chart a credible path"" back to the RBA's 2-3% inflation target. read more

Quarterly inflation numbers due Wednesday could show a further acceleration in price growth, which at 5.1% is already at its highest in two decades.

The rate-rise pledges are ironic coming from Lowe, who just months ago pushed back against markets, saying he didn't see rates rising throughout 2022, but has since lifted them three times since May. read more

Criticism of the RBA's inflation policy has led to an independent inquiry of its operations.

292,828,APPLE,2022-07-22,"Social media stocks slump as Twitter, Snap warn of dire ad spending","













July 22 (Reuters) - Shares of social media firms fell sharply on Friday after Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Snapchat's owner signaled advertisers had tightened their purse strings in response to a darkening economic outlook.

Pinterest Inc plunged 11.3%, Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) dropped 5.6%, Google-owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), which also sells ads online, fell 3.3%.

At current prices Pinterest, Meta, Twitter, Alphabet and Snap were collectively set to lose about $42 billion in market value.

Twitter also blamed its ongoing battle to close its $44-billion acquisition by Elon Musk for the surprise fall in quarterly revenue. The micro-blogging site's shares were down 0.1% in choppy trading. read more

Advertisers have pared back spending amid rising interest rates and surging inflation as some of them struggle with labor shortages and supply chain disruptions, Snap Inc said on Thursday. read more

""If you want proof that companies are nervous about the economic outlook, just look at how media platforms and marketing agencies are bemoaning a tougher advertising market,"" Russ Mould, AJ Bell investment director, said.

Investors are bracing for the slowest global revenue growth in the history of the social media sector as Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) privacy changes further cloud outlook. read more

Snap Inc's shares were down 36.4% and were the most heavily traded across U.S. exchanges, as the company said it was looking for new sources of revenue to grow.

""Unfortunately for Snap and the digital ad sector, we believe there are signs of further ad spending cuts,"" RBC Capital Markets said in a note.

Attention now turns to quarterly reports from mega-cap firms Meta and Alphabet next week. Some analysts believe the drop in their share prices reflects what is likely to be a subdued report.

""While more revenue cuts for advertising stocks are likely, we think Alphabet has more relative revenue stability given breadth of advertisers, more expense flexibility than most peers,"" analysts at Bank of American Global Research said.

293,339,APPLE,2022-07-25,Tech investors may be overvaluing moats,"













NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Technology investing is mostly about carving out a business that can’t be copied and reaping monopoly-style margins. Investors seem to think Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Apple (AAPL.O) have done this, but they may be overvaluing the moats.

Over the past year, Meta Platforms (META.O) and Netflix (NFLX.O) valuations have been pounded as competition in advertising and video streaming has caused investors to reassess growth prospects. Meta’s stock, for example, has lost half its value since the start of 2022 as tech giants Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Apple are expanding fast in advertising. The rise of TikTok makes the walls surrounding ad-dependent social networks in particular look flimsy read more . Similarly, the growth of streaming services from Apple, Walt Disney (DIS.N) and others have slowed subscriber growth at Netflix to a crawl and pressured margins.

Investors have fewer worries when it comes to Microsoft and Apple. With Apple’s first quarter market share of North American mobile phone shipments exceeding 50%, according to Canalys, it is increasingly inconceivable to think that users will ditch their iPhones. And it’s credible to think the $2.5 trillion company’s Chief Executive Tim Cook will have success selling more advertising and financial services to its customers. It’s even harder to imagine companies abandoning their workplace software, run by Microsoft, which, for example, holds 85% of the market share in U.S. public sector productivity software, according to Omdia.

And yet valuation multiples reflect these relative expectations, and then some. The stock price of Meta has corrected so much, its enterprise value is now worth less than 4 times estimated revenue for the next 12 months. Five years ago, that metric was 9 times, according to Datastream. Netflix has an enterprise value of 3 times estimated revenue for the next 12 months, half its valuation five years ago. Meantime, Apple, at 6 times, is twice its valuation from five years ago. Likewise, Microsoft’s multiple has risen 60% to over 8 times.

The buffers for the latter two companies are assailable. Rivals still want to steal customers, antitrust regulators can’t be dismissed entirely, and the biggest threat – these firms miss out on a market shift as tech advances – remains. While moats protect against rivals, they may do little against a recessionary wave that smashes earnings in the sector overall. Technology investors may be right on their assessment, but wrong on the way they are valuing it.

Summary Law firms

Law firms Related documents Koss accused Apple of copying wireless headphone tech

Companies settled Saturday before scheduled Monday trial















(Reuters) - Apple Inc has agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by headphone maker Koss Corp over Apple's AirPod earbuds and Beats headphones, the companies said in a court filing Saturday.

With trial in the case set to begin Monday, the companies told the Waco, Texas federal court that they had resolved allegations that Apple infringed Koss' wireless-headphone patents.

U.S. District Judge Alan Albright dismissed the case with prejudice the same day, which means it cannot be refiled.

Details of the settlement were not available, and the companies and their attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based Koss sued Apple in 2020 for allegedly infringing several patents covering aspects of a wireless headphone system that Koss said it developed in the early 2000s.

Koss also sued other competitors in West Texas, including Bose and Skullcandy. Those cases are now pending on other courts.

Koss told the Texas court it turned to litigation because the headphone industry had ""caught up to Koss's early 2000s vision"" and its technology had ""become standardized, with whole listening ecosystems having been built around the techniques Koss conceived of over a decade ago.""

Koss asked for royalties from sales of AirPods and wireless Beats headphones in the Apple case.

Apple argued that its products did not infringe and that the patents were invalid. It also sued Koss in San Francisco shortly after Koss brought its lawsuit, arguing the complaint included confidential information from their licensing discussions.

The Saturday filing in Texas says the companies have settled ""all matters in controversy between them.""

The case is Koss Corp v. Apple Inc, U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, No. 6:20-cv-00665.

For Koss: Peter Soskin, Benjamin Weed, Jim Shimota and Darlene Ghavimi of K&L Gates.

295,871,APPLE,2022-07-25,Illegal Brazil gold tied to Italian refiner and Big Tech customers,"[1/3] A wildcat gold miner, or garimpeiro, uses a basin and mercury to pan for gold at a wildcat gold mine, also known as a garimpo, at a deforested area of the Amazon rainforest near Crepurizao, in the municipality of Itaituba, Para State, Brazil, August 5, 2017. REUTERS/Nacho Doce/File Photo















SAO PAULO, July 25 (Reuters) - Brazilian police allege an Italian refiner purchased gold from a trader sourcing it illegally in the Amazon rainforest region, according to police documents, and corporate disclosures show that refiner has supplied the precious metal to four of the world's largest tech companies.

Public filings by Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) name the private Italian firm Chimet as a source of some gold used in their products. Tech companies often use small amounts of the metal in circuit boards for consumer electronics.

According to police documents obtained by investigative journalism outfit Reporter Brasil and reviewed by Reuters, Brazilian federal police have accused Chimet of buying millions of dollars in gold from trader CHM do Brasil, which allegedly acquired the precious metal illegally from wildcat miners.

CHM do Brasil, responding to questions via a lawyer, said all its gold was legally acquired with proper documentation.

Illegal mining has surged in Brazil since right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro took office in 2019, advocating for wildcatters and seeking to legalize mining on indigenous land.

Unregulated mines have destroyed rainforest land in the Amazon while polluting rivers with deadly mercury. Miners have clashed violently with indigenous tribes protecting their land, leaving a trail of death, disease and intimidation. read more

Brazilian sustainability think tank Instituto Escolhas estimated that the country produced 84 tonnes of illegal gold in Bolsonaro's first two years in office, up 23% from the two years before and equivalent to nearly half of Brazil's total gold output.

""A company that is buying gold from Brazil already knows there is a huge risk it is buying irregular gold - Amazon blood gold,"" said Larissa Rodrigues, an author of the Escolhas report.

A Chimet representative said the company cut off relations with CHM upon learning of the allegations in October 2021, when police conducted raids in nine Brazilian states and the federal district targeting CHM and others allegedly involved in the illegal gold trade.

A police document summarizing the investigation dated August 2021 states that Chimet allegedly bought 2.1 billion reais ($385 million) worth of gold from CHM between 2015 and 2020.

A federal police spokesperson in Para state declined to comment on the investigation because it is ongoing and remains under seal. Indictments will likely be announced when the probe concludes later this year, he said.

Federal prosecutors would then have to decide whether to press charges, he added.

The four U.S. tech firms listed Chimet among more than 100 gold refiners in their supply chains during the investigation's five-year timeframe and in the most recent 2021 disclosures.

Chimet does not have a direct relationship with the four tech majors but sells gold to banks that can resell it for a variety of uses, company representative Giovanni Prelazzi said in a statement to Reuters. He did not name the banks.

Apple did not specifically address Chimet but said in a statement that its policies prohibit use of illegally mined minerals. Companies that cannot comply are removed from its supply chain, the iPhone maker said.

Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft declined to comment.

Chimet said that, after learning of the CHM investigation in Brazil, it contracted accounting firm Deloitte to conduct an audit of its other suppliers and in April 2022 it was again certified by bullion market association LBMA as meeting responsible gold sourcing standards.

An LBMA representative told Reuters that Chimet's actions showed similar problems did not exist with other suppliers and that verification methods were being strengthened.

NOT REGISTERED

The police documents allege that CHM was not registered with Brazil's central bank as an entity legally authorized to buy and sell gold, known as DTVMs.

CHM does not appear in the central bank's online directory of registered DTVMs. It is illegal for anyone other than miners and their associations to buy and sell gold in Brazil without such a registration.

CHM said it did not buy gold as a financial instrument and that registration is not required to buy gold as a commodity.

The central bank said it did not regulate ""operations with gold classified as a commodity.""

A 2020 analysis of relevant laws by federal prosecutors found that such registration is required for anyone other than miners to buy and sell gold, regardless of its usage.

Financial records of bank transfers show CHM bought gold from both the cooperative and directly from several individuals in the southern part of Para state, which forms part of the Brazilian Amazon.

The cooperative COOPEROURI has a permit to mine in an area next to the protected Kayapo indigenous reserve, but police found both CHM and the coop bought from independent miners without permits, according to the investigation documents.

COOPEROURI could not be reached for comment.

The police report said the cooperative and individual miners are believed to be extracting ore illegally in the indigenous reserve, although did not state the basis for that allegation.

In the police report, satellite images of the Kayapo reserve - a region larger than Belgium - show vast swathes of muddy mining pools and clandestine airstrips to access them.

Summary Law firms Tech litigator Lauren Goldman joins Gibson Dunn as a partner

Her clients have included Facebook, Shutterfly















(Reuters) - Law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher has hired Lauren Goldman, a New York-based partner who leaves her role as a leader of Mayer Brown's Supreme Court and appellate group, the firm said on Monday.

Goldman, a longtime Mayer Brown litigator, focuses on technology and data privacy issues, according to Los Angeles-founded Gibson Dunn.

She was part of a team that represented Facebook, now Meta Platforms Inc, in biometric privacy litigation over its facial recognition technology, according to court documents. Facebook settled for $650 million and did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to the 2020 settlement.

Goldman recently represented Shutterfly Inc in a facial recognition biometric privacy lawsuit, which settled for $6.75 million last year, court filings said. The digital imaging company denied wrongdoing.

She also was on the team that helped notch a jury trial win for Palmer Luckey, the founder of Facebook Inc's virtual reality unit Oculus VR, in an IP case last fall.

A Mayer Brown spokesperson said the firm wishes Goldman well.

Mayer Brown's Supreme Court and appellate practice is co-headed by Nicole Saharsky, former assistant to the U.S. solicitor general. Andrew Pincus, who previously held the same position, and served as general counsel of the U.S. Department of Commerce, is also part of the team.

Gibson Dunn, which has about 1,600 lawyers globally, has in the past few months hired several other partners who focus on technology and privacy matters.

The firm recruited another Mayer Brown partner, former Apple Inc attorney Vivek Mohan, to co-chair its artificial intelligence and automated systems practice in June.

297,632,APPLE,2022-07-26,"As Zuckerberg bets on TikTok-style videos, Meta heads for first-ever revenue drop","













July 26 (Reuters) - Meta's (META.O) future may lie in the metaverse, but when the company reports results on Wednesday, investors will be focused on two more immediate bets: pumping up short-video offering Reels to compete with TikTok and rebuilding its ads system after Apple (AAPL.O) throttled access to user data.

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg believes that will take time, and that the company needs to speed up the process, he told staffers on a call late last month. The discussion hit on key issues that will be watched in Meta's quarterly results release on Wednesday. read more

Meta is expected to record its first-ever revenue drop in its history as a public company, down 0.4% to about $29 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Investors are also bracing for flat user growth and a third consecutive quarter of profit declines and are watching for signs of hardware project cuts and slower hiring to manage costs. read more

The social media giant this year has unveiled sweeping redesigns of Facebook and Instagram, imitating rival TikTok's look and algorithmically driven recommendations of viral short videos.

Meta is also investing heavily to rebuild its ads system around its own user data, after privacy changes introduced last year by Apple degraded Meta's ad targeting capabilities.

Zuckerberg told employees on the call, which took place on June 30, that Reels represented a ""huge opportunity"" for Meta, but also noted that the format was ""still only around 15% of the size of TikTok.""

""I think realistically we're looking at a year and a half, maybe even longer, before we'll really have a line of sight to having a strong leadership position,"" he said.

The timeline for rebuilding the ads system was similar, he said. He repeatedly urged staff to increase their ""intensity"" to get through the period.

While Meta has the strongest first-party user data in the industry, it also ""has a lot of credibility to restore before investors can get comfortable with maintaining its leadership position in digital advertising's secular growth,"" analysts from RBC Capital Markets wrote.

Zuckerberg told employees that the economy had worsened since executives first planned the Reels and ad changes, and outlined plans to expedite the transitions so profits from the core business could fund Meta's long-term metaverse bets.

""Our job is basically to bring in as much of the business that might be three years out into two years out, or one and a half years out, while also pushing on things like expenses and cost growth,"" he said.

If needed, he added, his inclination was to ""take more pain in terms of a little bit less profitability"" in the short term, rather than cutting back on ""funding for future stuff.""

The changes have created some backlash, though.

Instagram, which has been testing TikTok-like features, last week postponed plans to replace the app's scrolling feed with a more immersive ""panavision""-style layout that fills the entire screen, from October to early next year.

A Meta spokesperson said the company recognizes ""that changes to the app can be an adjustment, and we want to take the time to make sure we get this right.""

On Monday, two of Instagram's biggest users, Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner, both shared a meme imploring the company to ""Make Instagram Instagram again.""

""Stop trying to be TikTok I just want to see cute photos of my friends,"" the post said. It signed off: ""Sincerely, everyone.""

Instagram head Adam Mosseri acknowledged the criticism in a video on Tuesday, saying the layout was ""not yet good"" and the company would have to ""get it to a good place if we're going to ship it"" to all Instagram users.

The company would continue doing tests and shifting toward video however, he added.

298,589,APPLE,2022-07-26,Meta bumps prices of Quest 2 headsets ahead of successor release,"













July 26 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) said on Tuesday it would raise the prices of its Meta Quest 2 virtual reality (VR) headset by about $100 from August, even as the company prepares to launch a successor headset later this year.

With its rebrand in November last year, Meta has doubled down on metaverse and VR. It recently announced upgrades to its VR platform, Horizon Worlds, and opened a physical store for users to demo the headsets.

Meta said the 128-gigabyte and 256-gigabyte versions of Quest 2 will retail for $399.99 and $499.99, respectively. It also bumped prices for some accessories and refurbished units.

""We're making a change that will help us continue to invest for the long term and keep driving the VR industry forward,"" Meta said in a statement, adding that users have spent over $1 billion on Meta Quest apps.

Meta said it will launch a new high-end VR headset, code-named Project Cambria, later this year, without mentioning a date or device specifications.

Meanwhile, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is said to be working on its own VR headset, according to reports. (https://reut.rs/3baXvJJ)

NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - Results from the four largest U.S. companies by market value highlight a busy week of corporate earnings and could help determine whether the stock market can sustain its recent rally.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) are set to report after the market closes on Tuesday, with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) due on Thursday, in a week that will see reports from about 170 companies representing some 47% of the S&P 500's market value, according to Credit Suisse.

Those four companies, which have helped power gains for the benchmark S&P 500 for the past decade, account for nearly one-fifth of the weigh in the index.

What they forecast is ""pretty representative of how the economy is doing,"" said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco. ""If Microsoft comes in and says things are ok, if Google says things are ok, then that represents a significant weight in not just market cap but the overall economy.""

The heart of the second-quarter earnings period is overlapping with Wednesday's decision from the Federal Reserve on interest rates. The central bank is expected to hike by 75 basis points as it seeks to fight the worst inflation in 40 years. read more

With inflation surging and rate hikes weighing on risk sentiment this year, the S&P 500 is down about 17% in 2022, but has rebounded 7% since its closing low for the year in June.

""This week could be very critical to whether we can continue to recover or whether this is just some kind of bear market rally on the way back down towards lows,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at family investment office Cherry Lane Investments.

The S&P 500 was down 0.6% early Tuesday after retailer Walmart (WMT.N) slashed its profit forecast as rising prices for food and fuel prompted customers to cut back on discretionary purchases. read more

Investors' expectations for second-quarter results were downbeat heading into the period, given concerns about a potential recession as well as inflation raising costs for businesses and consumers.

With 107 S&P 500 companies reported so far, about 75% have posted earnings above analysts' expectations, according to Refinitiv IBES data as of Monday. However, that trails the 81% beat rate for the past four quarters.

Earnings are expected to have climbed 6.1% for the second quarter from the year-ago period, according to Refinitiv. Tech sector earnings are projected to rise 2.4%.

The four megacap companies plus Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O) -- which reports on Wednesday -- are projected in aggregate to increase revenues by 6.7% but see earnings fall by 14.4%, according to Credit Suisse strategists.

When Alphabet and Meta report, focus will be on advertising spending after Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Snapchat's owner Snap Inc (SNAP.N) last week signaled advertisers had tightened their purse strings in response to a darkening economic outlook. read more

Investors will be keen for insight on consumer demand from Apple, maker of iPhones and MacBooks, and online retail giant Amazon.

Microsoft has already warned of financial headwinds from currency effects from the strong dollar, a factor that is expected to loom over an array of companies this period. read more

Overall, investors will want to learn how these companies are ""navigating what has really become a difficult economic environment for them,"" marked by supply chain snags, rising costs and slowing demand, Meckler said.

""The megacaps have historically proven incredibly resilient,” Meckler said.

300,862,APPLE,2022-07-26,"Taiwan Q2 GDP to gain from chip exports, but face COVID headwinds: Reuters poll","Summary

Summary Companies reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=cpurl://apps.cp./Apps/econ-polls?RIC=TWGDPP%3DECI

Preliminary Q2 GDP seen at +3.1% y/y (prior qtr +3.14%)

Data due Friday, July 29, at 4 p.m. (0800 GMT)















TAIPEI, July 26 (Reuters) - Taiwan's trade-reliant economy is expected to have expanded on the back of strong global demand for computer chips, though COVID-19 lockdowns in top export market China and a surge in domestic infections could drag on demand, a Reuters poll showed.

Gross domestic product (GDP) likely grew 3.1% in April-June versus a year earlier, the poll of 24 economists shows, after it expanded 3.14% year-on-year in the first quarter. read more

Policymakers have said they expect full-year 2022 growth of less than 4%, downgrading it from previous forecasts of more than 4% and slower than the 6.45% logged for 2021. That was the fastest rate in over a decade since it expanded 10.25% in 2010.

Economists' forecasts for preliminary GDP data due on Friday varied widely from growth of 1.4% to as high as 4.4%.

""Investment should be the key growth driver in 2Q, thanks to the still strong capital spending among the leading semiconductor firms,"" said analysts at DBS bank.

Demand for Taiwanese goods has been hit by COVID-19 lockdowns in China, while domestic consumption has taken a hit from a surge in local cases, though infections are now waning and Taiwan has never fully locked down.

As a key hub in the global technology supply chain for giants such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Taiwan's economy has outperformed many of its regional peers.

A global shortage of semiconductors has swelled order books for Taiwanese chipmakers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) (2330.TW).

TSMC reported forecast-beating second quarter earnings this month, saying it was ""highly confident"" about its long-term prospects. read more

The economy in China, Taiwan's largest trading partner, grew a tepid 0.4% in the second quarter, highlighting the colossal toll on activity from widespread COVID-19 lockdowns. read more

Taiwan's preliminary figures will be released in a statement with minimal commentary. Revised figures will be released a few weeks later, with more details and forward-looking forecasts.

301,840,APPLE,2022-07-27,LG Display reverses into loss as inflation ends COVID-fuelled demand surge,"













SEOUL, July 27 (Reuters) - South Korean display panel maker LG Display Co (034220.KS) said on Wednesday it swung to a second-quarter loss from a profit a year earlier, as inflation and interest rate hikes undercut demand for panels used in TVs and gadgets.

The Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier said it expected only a limited recovery in panel shipments in the third quarter, due to weaker consumer confidence.

""As a downturn looms, consumption is expected to generally slow down except for essential goods,"" the company said in an earnings call.

""Set makers and retailers in general are becoming more conservative in their business operations.""

The company's operating loss was 488 billion won ($371 million) for the April-June quarter, compared with a profit of 701 billion won in the same period last year. Business had been boosted for several quarters by strong home entertainment-related demand during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The quarterly operating loss, the first since the second quarter of 2020, was steeper than an average forecast of a 343 billion won loss from 12 analysts polled by Refinitiv SmartEstimate.

Revenue fell 20% on the year to 5.6 trillion won, LG Display said in a regulatory filing.

LG Display saw a decrease in panel shipments in the second quarter as China's prolonged COVID lockdowns disrupted supply chains, while demand in the industry generally was affected by increasing economic volatility and uncertainty.

Prices of 55-inch liquid crystal display (LCD) panels for TV sets fell about 12% in the April-June quarter compared with January-March, according to data from TrendForce's WitsView.

LG Display said it will accelerate its plan to reduce its LCD TV panel business, with a halt to LCD production in South Korea by next year, and concentrate more on high-end IT-related products.

LG Display shares closed up 0.3% after the earnings were announced, versus the wider market's (.KS11) 0.1% rise.

302,568,APPLE,2022-07-27,Qualcomm warns of sales hit from cooling smartphone demand,"













July 27 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) forecast fourth-quarter revenue below Wall Street targets on Wednesday, bracing for a difficult economy and a slowdown in smartphone demand that could hurt its mainstay handset chip business.

Shares of the San Diego-based company fell about 2.8% in extended trading, deepening this year's drop of about 18% amid a broader selloff in growth stocks.

""We expect the elevated uncertainty in the global economy and the impact of COVID measures in China will cause customers to act with caution in managing their purchases in the second half,"" said Chief Financial Officer Akash Palkhiwala.

The Ukraine crisis and China lockdowns have also worsened supply-chain snags and hurt demand, forcing many phone makers to cut orders for chips.

The company now expects smartphone sales to fall 5% this year, compared with its prior outlook for flat growth. IDC had projected a 3.5% drop in smartphone shipments.

More than half of Qualcomm's total sales comes from the handset segment, which makes modem chips for Apple (AAPL.O) iPhones and chips that power some models of Samsung's (005930.KS) Galaxy S series.

Company executives reiterated that Qualcomm's focus on supplying chips to premium phones and its push to diversify into other sectors such as automotive would cushion the hit from cooling smartphone demand.

In the third quarter, the chip designer beat expectations for adjusted revenue, driven by growth of 59% at its handset chip business.

Chief Executive Cristiano Amon said revenue from the automotive business reached a record in the third quarter and would surpass that in the next.

Qualcomm forecast current-quarter revenue between $11 billion and $11.8 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $11.87 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

It expects adjusted earnings per share of between $3 and $3.30, compared with estimates of $3.23.

Adjusted revenue for the quarter ended June 26 was $10.93 billion, compared with estimates of $10.88 billion. Revenue for Qualcomm's chip designing business was $9.38 billion, up 45% on the year while its licensing business produced $1.52 billion, up 2% on the year.

Separately, Qualcomm said it had extended its patent license agreement with Samsung Electronics through the end of 2030. Amon said that would help secure revenue stability for its licensing business.

Qualcomm also agreed to expand the use of its Snapdragon platforms for future premium Samsung Galaxy products, including Samsung Galaxy phones.

""When we provide the Snapdragon 800 platform to a Galaxy smartphone, in terms of revenue and earnings, it replaces at least the revenue and earnings of selling modems to five iPhones,"" said Amon.

Qualcomm is sharpening its focus on chips that power phones rather than modem chips used to connect to networks as major customer Apple works on its own modem chips.

Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, said Amon ""has been on a relentless drive to diversify Qualcomm beyond smartphones, in part to help mitigate any future loss from Apple's modem switch"".

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/Pool















July 27 (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband sold his shares of chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA.O) on Tuesday, days before the House is expected to consider legislation providing subsidies and tax credits worth over $70 billion to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry.

In a periodic transaction report, the senior Democrat disclosed that her husband, financier Paul Pelosi, sold 25,000 shares of Nvidia for about $4.1 million, ending up with a loss of $341,365.

Paul Pelosi frequently trades shares of companies popular with many investors, including Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and other tech companies.

Transaction reports filed by Pelosi, a multi-millionaire, show her husband bought 5,000 Nvidia shares in July 2021, and that he exercised options to buy another 20,000 Nvidia shares last June.

The Senate is expected to vote on final passage in coming days of legislation providing about $52 billion in government subsidies for U.S. semiconductor production, as well as an investment tax credit for chip plants estimated to be worth $24 billion.

The legislation, which aims to make the domestic chip industry more competitive with China's, would then be taken up in the U.S. House under Pelosi's direction.

Last year, Pelosi defended the rights of federal lawmakers to trade stocks, but she later responded to calls for a ban on trading by lawmakers by signaling willingness to potentially advance such legislation.

A 2012 law makes it illegal for lawmakers to use information from their work in Congress for their personal gain. The law requires them to disclose stock transactions by themselves or family members within 45 days.

An analysis by Unusual Whales, a service selling financial data, concluded that congressional lawmakers last year traded $290 million in stocks, options, cryptocurrency and other assets, and that they outperformed the market, on average.

Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia is most valuable U.S chipmaker.

304,730,APPLE,2022-07-27,China Q2 smartphone sales fall 14.2% y/y as consumers pull back,"













SHANGHAI, July 27 (Reuters) - Chinese smartphone sales in April-June fell 14.2% on year and volumes hit a decade low, Counterpoint Research said on Wednesday, as China struggles to recover from the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns and the industry braces for more uncertainty.

Quarterly sales volumes were 12.6% lower than those seen in the first quarter of 2020, when the pandemic hit China and sales were the worst since the fourth quarter of 2012, when the iPhone 5 was introduced, according to Counterpoint.

The research firm does not give unit sales estimates.

Consumers have tightened their belts and business activity has slowed amid China's pursuit of its ""zero-COVID"" strategy to stamp out infections. The commercial hub of Shanghai was locked down in April-May and strict pandemic curbs nationwide continue to weigh on consumer spending.

Sales for the top brands all shrank annually over the quarterly period, with the exception of Honor, which was formally spun out of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd (HWT.UL) in 2021.

Honor's share of the market surged to 18.3% from 7.7%, making it the second-best selling player, behind vivo. Sales, meanwhile, more than doubled.

""Honor's coverage in lower-tier cities, which saw fewer lockdowns, helpd the brand steer through the turbulence in Q2 2022,"" said Mengmeng Zhang, research analyst at Counterpoint.

Apple Inc (AAPL.O) ranked as the fourth top-selling brand, with a market share of 15%. The iPhone maker's quarterly sales volumes dropped 5.8%, a smaller blow compared with Oppo, Xiaomi (1810.HK), and vivo.

The Cupertino-based firm has seen comparatively stable sales in China in the past few years. Earlier this week, however, it announced discounts in China, a move it occasionally makes when sales are slow.

DUBLIN, July 27 (Reuters) - The Irish government on Wednesday said it will appoint two additional commissioners to Ireland's Data Protection Commission, lead regulator in Europe for tech giants Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, Meta Platforms (META.O) unit Facebook, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N)).

Minister for Justice Helen McEntee said the appointments will support existing commissioner Helen Dixon and improve the commission's ability to handle an increased workload and increasingly complex investigative requirements.

Ireland regulates a number of large U.S. internet giants because their European Union headquarters are in the country, but its DPC has been criticised for long, plodding investigations into big tech multinationals. Pressure has been building for a pan-European approach to data and privacy protection.

Dixon's office has so far completed three investigations of multinationals under new EU privacy rules introduced in 2018, including hitting WhatsApp with a 225 million euro fine last year.

Speaking to Reuters in February, Dixon said staffing at the regulator has increased to 195 from 27 in 2014 and the numbers needed to be increased more. However, she dismissed calls for another two commissioners to be appointed to speed up the processing of the backlog in cases.

""We don't think a three-headed organisation will improve some of the issues that we have talked about in terms of perception of speed,"" she said.

Last month, the head of the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), Wojciech Wiewiorowski, called for a pan-European data protection enforcement model to ensure consistent high-level protection of fundamental rights to data protection and privacy across the European Union. read more

LOS ANGELES/STOCKHOLM, July 27 (Reuters) - Spotify Technology SA's (SPOT.N) Car Thing player is now a thing of the past.

The world's leading audio streaming service on Wednesday announced it would discontinue the device just five months after it became available to all users in the United States. read more In doing so, Spotify became the latest software technology company to stumble in an attempt to build hardware.

Spotify wrote down a $31 million investment in the device, which was aimed at increasing the number of users who listen to music or podcasts while in the car. However, the company said it was unable to sell enough devices at a sufficiently high price to justify the investment.

""We just can't get it to an attractive economical profile,"" Spotify CEO Daniel Ek told Reuters. ""So we decided to terminate this program in light of that.""

Car Thing was a next-generation stereo designed to stream Spotify's music and podcasts from the user's phone through the car audio system. After unveiling trials in May 2019, Spotify tested the device with a small group of people in April 2021, and then brought it to wider release in February this year.

Spotify was not the first software company to seek to extend its relationship with users into the physical world through devices.

Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google was one of the early software companies to venture into hardware experiments with some major failures, including Google Glass - a wearable Android device resembling eyeglasses, which displayed information in the user's field of vision.

Snap Inc (SNAP.N) shelved its original Spectacles, $130 sunglasses that transmitted video directly to the SnapChat app, back in 2017. It announced a new type of Spectacles last year, featuring augmented reality.

Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) Facebook plans to stop producing a consumer version of a videoconferencing device dubbed Portal, instead focusing on the business market. It also disappointed people with its phone that came out in 2013 in partnership with HTC. It launched to mixed reviews, with critics raising privacy concerns.

IDC research vice president Frank Gillett said he could not recall any content company making a successful transition to hardware.

By contrast, a hardware maker like Apple Inc (AAPL.O) was able to launch music and video services by building on its operating system and existing device relationship with consumers.

""When they created the iPod, they had people in the ecosystem,"" said Gillett, adding that launching a device without such an infrastructure ""is extremely challenging.""

While Spotify rules the music streaming niche, building a device for the car put it in a competitive arena with the likes of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto - both of which have the support of their own ecosystems of billions of devices.

Spotify said its device was not designed to challenge these entertainment systems, but rather to provide an easier way for its users - especially those with older model cars - to listen to music or podcasts.

However, Car Thing lacked the features of the other infotainment devices, from navigation to making calls, making it harder to justify the need for a device just for music. It also required free listeners to upgrade to premium subscription.

Spotify CFO Paul Vogel told investors on Wednesday in addition to pricing challenges, inflation drove up component costs and a chip shortage made it harder to obtain parts.

Veteran consumer electronics analyst Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies said consumers are reluctant to add devices to their cars when 98% of new cars in the United States come with Apple's CarPlay already installed.

""I remember thinking: 'This is dead in the water,'"" said Bajarin.

307,648,APPLE,2022-07-27,Google Maps launches Street View in India after 11-year wait,"













NEW DELHI, July 27 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google Maps on Wednesday launched its panoramic Street View service in 10 Indian cities in partnership with Tech Mahindra and Genesys, 11 years after a first attempt ran into regulatory troubles.

The feature, which offers 360-degree views of streets around the world using photos taken by cruising vehicles, has faced privacy complaints and regulatory scrutiny in many countries.

The Indian launch comes after Google was denied permission at least twice in the last decade by the government over security concerns.

Company executives said on Wednesday it was able to meet the regulatory requirements thanks to a new geospatial policy from India last year, which allows foreign map operators to provide panoramic imagery by licensing the data from local partners.

Data collection was entirely done by Tech Mahindra and Genesys, Google said, adding the service would be available in over 50 Indian cities by the end of this year.

Street View imagery will blur out faces of individuals and license plates to address privacy concerns, said Miriam Daniel, Vice President of Google Maps Experiences.

Wednesday's announcement coincided with a similar feature launch from MapmyIndia (CEIF.NS), which powers Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) maps in the country. Its Mappls RealView is live across thousands of cities, the company said.

Google also announced a partnership with India's Central Pollution Control Board to provide air quality information over maps.

July 27 (Reuters) - The European Union found evidence that smartphones used by some of its staff were compromised by an Israeli company's spy software, the bloc's top justice official said in a letter seen by Reuters.

In a July 25 letter sent to European lawmaker Sophie in ‘t Veld, EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said iPhone maker Apple had told him in 2021 that his iPhone had possibly been hacked using Pegasus, a tool developed and sold to government clients by Israeli surveillance firm NSO Group.

The warning from Apple triggered the inspection of Reynders’ personal and professional devices as well as other phones used by European Commission employees, the letter said.

Though the investigation did not find conclusive proof that Reynders' or EU staff phones were hacked, investigators discovered ""indicators of compromise"" – a term used by security researchers to describe that evidence exists showing a hack occurred.

Reynders’ letter did not provide further detail and he said ""it is impossible to attribute these indicators to a specific perpetrator with full certainty."" It added that the investigation was still active.

Messages left with Reynders, the European Commission, and Reynders' spokesman David Marechal were not immediately returned.

An NSO spokeswoman said the firm would willingly cooperate with an EU investigation.

""Our assistance is even more crucial, as there is no concrete proof so far that a breach occurred,"" the spokeswoman said in a statement to Reuters. ""Any illegal use by a customer targeting activists, journalists, etc., is considered a serious misuse.""

NSO Group is being sued by Apple Inc (AAPL.O) for violating its user terms and services agreement.

LAWMAKERS' QUESTIONS

Reuters first reported in April that the European Union was investigating whether phones used by Reynders and other senior European officials had been hacked using software designed in Israel. Reynders and the European Commission declined to comment on the report at the time.

Reynders' acknowledgement in the letter of hacking activity was made in response to inquiries from European lawmakers, who earlier this year formed a committee to investigate the use of surveillance software in Europe.

Last week the committee announced that its investigation found 14 EU member states had purchased NSO technology in the past.

Reynders' letter – which was shared with Reuters by in 't Veld, the committee’s rapporteur – said officials in Hungary, Poland and Spain had been or were in the process of being questioned about their use of Pegasus.

In 't Veld said it was imperative to find out who targeted the EU Commission, suggesting it would be especially scandalous if it were found that an EU member state was responsible.

The European Commission also raised the issue with Israeli authorities, asking them to take steps to ""prevent the misuse of their products in the EU,"" the letter said.

A spokesperson for the Israeli Ministry of Defense did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Apple's alerts, sent late last year, told targeted users that a hacking tool, dubbed ForcedEntry, may have been used against their devices to download spyware. Apple said in a lawsuit that ForcedEntry had been the work of NSO Group. Reuters also previously reported that another, smaller Israeli firm named QuaDream had developed a nearly identical tool.

In November, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden gave NSO Group a designation that makes it harder for U.S. companies to do business with them, after determining that its phone-hacking technology had been used by foreign governments to ""maliciously target"" political dissidents around the world.

NSO, which has kept its client list confidential, has said that it sells its products only to ""vetted and legitimate"" government clients.

July 27 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) issued a gloomy forecast after recording its first ever quarterly drop in revenue on Wednesday, with recession fears and competitive pressures weighing on its digital ads sales.

Shares of the Menlo Park, California-based company were down about 4.6% in extended trading.

The company said it expects third-quarter revenue to fall to $26 billion and $28.5 billion, which would make it a second year-over-year drop in a row. Analysts were expecting $30.52 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Total revenue, which consists almost entirely of ad sales, fell 1% to $28.8 billion in the second quarter ended June 30, from $29.1 billion last year. The figure slightly missed Wall Street's projections of $28.9 billion, according to Refinitiv.

The company, which operates the world's largest social media platform, reported mixed results for user growth.

Monthly active users on flagship social network Facebook came in slightly under analyst expectations at 2.93 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 1% year over year, while daily active users handily beat estimates at 1.97 billion.

Like many global companies, Meta is facing some revenue pressure from the strong dollar, as sales in foreign currencies amount to less in dollar terms. Meta said it expected a 6% revenue growth headwind in the third quarter, based on current exchange rates.

Still, the Meta results also suggest that fortunes in online ads sales may be diverging between search and social media players, with the latter impacted more severely as ad buyers reel in spending.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), the world's largest digital ad platform, reported a rise in quarterly revenue on Tuesday, with sales from its biggest moneymaker - Google search - topping investor expectations. read more

Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and Twitter (TWTR.N) both missed sales expectations last week and warned of an ad market slowdown in coming quarters, sparking a broad sell-off across the sector. read more

On top of economic pressures, Meta's core business is also experiencing unique strain as it competes with short video app TikTok for users' time and adjusts its ads business to privacy controls rolled out by Apple Inc (AAPL.O) last year.

The company is simultaneously carrying out several expensive overhauls as a result, revamping its core apps and boosting its ad targeting with AI, while also investing heavily in a longer-term bet on ""metaverse"" hardware and software. read more

Meta executives told investors they were making progress in replacing ad dollars lost as a result of the Apple changes but said it was being offset by the economic slowdown.

They added that Reels, a short video product Meta is increasingly inserting into users' feeds to compete with TikTok, was now generating over $1 billion annually in revenue.

However, Reels cannibalizes more profitable content that users could otherwise see and will continue to be a headwind on profits through 2022 before eventually boosting income, executives told analysts on Wednesday.

""They are being greatly affected by everything,"" Bokeh Capital Partners' Kim Forrest said, referring to the economic slowdown as well as competition from TikTok and Apple.

""Meta has a problem because they're chasing TikTok and if the Kardashians are talking about how they don't like Instagram ... Meta should really pay attention to that.""

On Monday, two of Instagram's biggest users, Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner, both shared a meme imploring the company to abandon its shift to TikTok-style content suggestions and ""make Instagram Instagram again."" read more

CEO Mark Zuckerberg did not appear to be swayed, however.

About 15% of content on Facebook and Instagram is currently recommended by AI from accounts users do not actively follow, and that percentage will double by the end of 2023, he told investors on the call.

For now, at least, the metaverse part of Meta's business remains largely theoretical. In the second quarter, Meta reported $218 million in non-ad revenue, which includes payments fees and sales of devices like its Quest virtual reality headsets, down from $497 million last year.

Its Reality Labs unit, which is responsible for developing metaverse-oriented technology like the VR headsets, reported sales of $452 million, down from $695 million in the first quarter.

Although Meta has recently slowed investments as cost pressures increased, executives reassured investors it was still on track to release a mixed-reality headset called Project Cambria later this year, focused on professionals.

Meta broke out the Reality Labs segment in its results for the first time earlier this year, when it revealed the unit had lost $10.2 billion in 2021.

Its second-quarter operating profit margin fell to 29% from 43% as costs rose sharply and revenue dipped.

In November, Chief Financial Officer David Wehner will become Meta's first chief strategy officer. Susan Li, Meta's current vice president of finance, will become CFO.

310,654,APPLE,2022-07-28,India blocks Krafton's game on concerns over data sharing in China - source,"













NEW DELHI/SEOUL, July 29 (Reuters) - India's government blocked a popular battle-royale format game from Krafton Inc (259960.KS), a South Korean company backed by China's Tencent (0700.HK), as it was concerned about its data sharing and mining in China, an Indian government source said.

New Delhi used powers it has under India's IT law to block Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI), relying on a provision it has invoked since 2020 to ban several other Chinese apps on national security concerns, said the government official and another source with direct knowledge.

The Indian government has not publicly announced the blocking. But the app was removed from Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google Play Store and Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) App Store as of Thursday evening in India.

The removal of BGMI, which had more than 100 million users in India, comes after the South Asian country's 2020 ban of another Krafton title, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG).

The PUBG crackdown was part of New Delhi's ban of more than 100 mobile apps of Chinese origins, following a months-long border standoff between the nuclear-armed rivals.

The ban has expanded since to cover more than 300 apps, including popular gaming app 'Free Fire', owned by Singapore's technology group Sea Ltd (SE.N).

Tencent held a 13.5% stake in Krafton as of end-March through an investment vehicle, according to Krafton's regulatory filing.

Krafton shares slumped more than 9% on the news on Friday, later paring losses to close down 4.5% in Seoul. The company said in May India accounted for a high single digit percentage of its revenue in the first quarter of this year.

Tencent Holdings shares fell 4.9% to their lowest since March 15.

A Google spokesperson said it blocked the game following a government directive, while India's IT ministry and Apple did not respond to requests for comment. The sources declined to be named as such orders are confidential.

The Chinese embassy in New Delhi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In Seoul, a Krafton spokesperson said the developer was talking to relevant authorities and companies to figure out the exact situation regarding the suspension in the two major app stores in India.

Krafton's India CEO Sean Hyunil Sohn told news portal TechCrunch earlier this week that the Indian government had previously noted that PUBG and BGMI are different games, adding that ""BGMI complies with all guidelines"" in India.

'CHINA INFLUENCE'

India invoked a section of its IT law, called 69A, to impose the ban, the two sources with direct knowledge told Reuters.

The section allows the government to block public access to content in the interest of national security, among other reasons. Orders issued under the section are generally confidential in nature.

Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) and non-profit Prahar had repeatedly asked the government to investigate ""China influence"" of BGMI, Prahar president Abhay Mishra said. SJM is the economic wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, an influential Hindu nationalist group close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party.

""In the so-called new avatar, the BGMI was no different from erstwhile PUBG with Tencent still controlling it in the background,"" Mishra said.

The ban elicited strong online reactions from popular gamers in India on Twitter and YouTube.

""I hope our government understands that thousands of esports athletes and content creators and their life is dependent on BGMI,"" tweeted Abhijeet Andhare, a Twitter user with more than 92,000 followers.

311,152,APPLE,2022-07-28,"Apple forecasts faster sales growth, strong iPhone demand despite glum economy","













July 28 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Thursday said parts shortages are easing and that demand for iPhones is unceasing despite consumers tightening other spending, helping it top Wall Street expectations and forecast faster sales growth ahead.

The Silicon Valley giant's shares rose 3.5% after hours following the release of the results.

Though macroeconomic indicators around the world are turning negative, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters there had been no slowdown in demand for iPhones, the company's biggest source of revenue.

Phone sales in the fiscal third quarter rose 3% to $40.7 billion, when Wall Street had braced for a 3% decline. By contrast, the overall global smartphone market dropped 9% during the just-ended quarter, according to Canalys data.

Apple's loyal and relatively affluent customer base has enabled it to weather consumer spending dips better than other brands in the past, and the company's latest quarterly results suggest a similar pattern emerging.

Canalys Research analyst Runar Bjorhovde said, ""Apple in that sense has a certain robustness that will allow it to be impacted less than a lot of its competitors.""

Apple offered some caution.

The slumping economy is hurting sales of advertising, accessories and home products, Apple's Maestri said in an interview, calling the units ""pockets of weakness.""

""Fortunately, we have a very broad portfolio, so we know we're going to be able to navigate that,"" he added.

The results show Apple's advertising business, which includes selling ads alongside news articles and app store search results, is vulnerable to marketing cuts just the same as rivals Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and Meta Platforms Inc (META.O).

Parts shortages will continue to hamper Mac and iPad sales, Maestri said, though the impact has been easing. They cost Apple under $4 billion in sales in the quarter ended June 25, less than it had forecast. Maestri said the company expects the hit to diminish further in the current quarter.

But Apple risks joining rivals in amassing an unsellable stockpile of tablets and PCs if more customers than expected hold off purchases due to rising inflation and interest rates.

""In terms of testing the demand, you can't really test the demand unless you have the supply,"" Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told analysts on Thursday. ""And we were so far from that last quarter that we have an estimate of what we believe demand was. But it is an estimate.""

Citing the economic uncertainty, Apple said it was not providing specific revenue guidance. But it said sales compared to a year ago should rise faster in the current quarter than 2% growth it posted in the just-ended quarter.

'MORE DELIBERATE'

Overall, Apple said quarterly sales and profit were $83.0 billion and $1.20 per share, above estimates of $82.8 billion and $1.16 per share, according to Refinitiv data.

The rising U.S. dollar has hit many companies such as Apple that generate substantial foreign revenue and are getting less cash back when they convert it. Apple said currency fluctuations slashed sales by 3% in the June quarter and would crimp them by 6% in the current quarter.

Shuttering its business in Russia earlier this year due to the war also has hurt sales.

Apple, like many of its tech industry peers, is slowing hiring and cutting costs given the tough economic climate. read more Cook said Thursday that Apple was ""being more deliberate in (hiring) in recognition of the realities of the environment.""

The most recent economic woes include supply chain disruptions that have hit production of some Apple products such as iPads and Macs whose assembly locations were clustered near regions of China that went into COVID lockdowns.

While sales of iPhones and iPads topped expectations, revenue from services, Mac computers and accessories missed Wall Street targets and sales in the crucial China market fell 1% as consumers being on lockdown there limited sales.

Apple also is confronting slow overall economic growth in China, where its fiscal third-quarter sales were $14.6 billion.

Growth in the company's services business, which has provided a boost to sales and profits in recent years, was 12%, below the previous year's 33% rate and resulting in $19.6 billion in revenue, below estimates of $19.7 billion.

Apple said it now has 860 million paying subscribers to its services, up from the previous quarter's 825 million.

Sales of iPads and Macs were $7.2 billion and $7.4 billion, compared with estimates of $6.9 billion and $8.7 billion. Mac sales represented a 10% contraction, after record sales since 2020, first from a work-from-home boost and then from Apple's new proprietary processor chips.

Its shares closed Thursday down about 11% so far this year, slightly less than the broader S&P 500 (.SPX) index and also less than other consumer hardware makers such as Sonos Inc (SONO.O) and Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS), the only company that sells more smartphones than Apple. read more

July 28 (Reuters) - Stiff competition from TikTok and Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) privacy changes will remain a cause for concern for Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) in the near term, Wall Street analysts said.

At least 16 brokerages cut their price targets on Meta after the company reported its first-ever quarterly revenue drop on Wednesday, highlighting challenges faced by U.S. companies from a stronger dollar and worries of an impending recession. read more

Shares of the company were down about 6% at $159.8, setting the Whatsapp owner on course to lose roughly $30 billion in market value for the day.

Last year, Meta's valuation hit the trillion-dollar mark and ended the year at more than $900 billion.

Apple upended the digital ad industry when it introduced new iPhone privacy controls last year that made it harder for companies such as Meta and Snap Inc (SNAP.N) to target and measure ads on their apps.

That, coupled with TikTok's aggressive growth, is worsening recessionary fears, according to analysts.

""Tough comps, macro and FX are certainly part of the near-term story, but TikTok competition and Apple iOS changes will both have a bigger impact than expected in 2022,"" J.P. Morgan analysts said.

Reels, a short video product that Meta is increasingly inserting into users' feeds to compete with TikTok, cannibalizes more profitable content and will be a headwind in the short term before eventually boosting income, company executives said. read more

Many analysts also expect Meta could return to stronger growth in 2023, but noted that the sputtering start to its metaverse dream, as regulators clamp down on big tech firms, would set back its innovation plans.

Also weighing on Meta's shares was the U.S. Federal Trade Commission seeking a court order to block the company from buying virtual reality content maker Within Unlimited. read more

Summary Companies U.S. economy contracts in the second quarter

Meta Platforms revenue drops for first time

Ford shares gain after results

Indexes: Dow up 1%, S&P 500 up 1.2%, Nasdaq up 1.1%















NEW YORK, July 28 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks on Thursday rallied for a second day, with all three major indexes ending up more than 1% as data showing a second consecutive quarterly contraction in the economy fueled investor speculation the Federal Reserve may not need to be as aggressive with interest rate hikes as some had feared.

The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes retreated following the data, while utilities (.SPLRCU) and real estate (.SPLRCR) - both of which tend to rise when yields fall - were the day's best-performing S&P 500 sectors.

The decline in yields may suggest ""that markets think the Fed will have to pivot and move rates lower at some point, maybe in the next 12-month period,"" said Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones.

""It does imply the pace of tightening will become more gradual going forward.""

In addition, the growth forecast for second-quarter earnings has risen this week as more S&P 500 companies reported results and beat analyst expectations. Among them, Ford Motor Co (F.N) shares jumped 6.1% after it reported a better-than-expected quarterly net income. read more

The news increased the possibility that the economy was on the cusp of a recession, and some investors said it might deter the Fed from continuing to aggressively increase rates as it battles high inflation.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 332.04 points, or 1.03%, to 32,529.63 the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 48.82 points, or 1.21%, to 4,072.43 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 130.17 points, or 1.08%, to 12,162.59.

Stocks had rallied in the previous session when the Fed raised rates and comments by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell eased some worries about the pace of rate hikes. read more

""More investors are getting in now because they think at least there's not going to be any big surprises over the balance of the summer,"" as far as rates are concerned, said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc, an investment advisory firm based in Toledo, Ohio.

The Fed on Wednesday raised the benchmark overnight rate by three-quarters of a percentage point. The move followed a 75 basis points hike last month and smaller moves in May and March, in an effort by the U.S. central bank to tamp down soaring inflation.

Investors have expressed concern that inflation and aggressive Fed rate hikes could at some point tip the economy into a recession. read more

314,359,APPLE,2022-07-28,Apple’s aging clout,"













NEW YORK, July 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apple’s (AAPL.O) quarterly results, released on Thursday, were mainly about flexing some aging clout. Revenue grew 2% compared to the same quarter last year as the $2.5 trillion company eked out slightly higher iPhone sales and faster expansion in services outweighed sales shrinkage in Macs, iPads and accessories. Investors seemed happy enough though, sending the stock up 3% after hours, as the company’ churned out cash flow from operations and returned over $28 billion to shareholders in the quarter.

Consumers are pulling back, but for Apple’s users, there’s no replacement for their iPhones, except for another one. Last quarter, the company had over half of the American smartphone market by shipments, said Canalys. More importantly, the firm continues to squeeze more out of them by selling financial services, apps and especially ads recently.

While 2% growth isn’t great for Apple historically, there’s nothing within the next several quarters that will obviously displace the iPhone or its ability to sell more services to users, short of government action. With Apple keeping a careful eye on its bottom line, that means a lot more cash for shareholders, even if growth lacks newness. (By Robert Cyran)

315,444,APPLE,2022-07-28,EXCLUSIVE EU mulls new unit with antitrust veterans to enforce tech rules - sources,"













BRUSSELS, July 28 (Reuters) - The European Commission is considering creating a new directorate that may be headed by two top antitrust officials to enforce tough new rules aimed at reining in the powers of Big Tech, two people familiar with the matter said.

Such a move could ease concerns that the EU competition watchdog may struggle to get technology giants such as Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Meta and Microsoft (MSFT.O) to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). read more

The landmark rules, agreed in March, will go into force next year. They will bar the companies from setting their own products as preferences, forcing app developers to use their payment systems, and leveraging users' data to push competing services.

The new directorate at the Commission's powerful antitrust arm may be headed by Alberto Bacchiega, director of information, communication and media, in charge of antitrust and merger cases involving the tech, media and consumer electronics industries, one of the people said.

Bacchiega could also be assisted by Thomas Kramler, head of the unit dealing with antitrust cases in e-commerce and data economy, and currently spearheading investigations into Apple and Amazon, the person said.

Both officials are already liasing with those at the Commission's Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology which will jointly enforce the DMA, a third person said.

Bacchiega and Kramler could not be reached for comment as they are away on their summer holiday.

The EU executive said it was organising itself internally so that it can enforce the DMA effectively.

""The enforcement of the DMA is estimated to require approximately 80 staff who would be redeployed internally, as appropriate,"" a spokeswoman said.

""The internal organisation will be based on the relevant expertise of all DGs (directorate-generals) and services involved, and ensure appropriate staffing of the relevant DGs and services,"" she said.

316,818,APPLE,2022-07-28,ITV expects new free streaming platform to appeal in tough times,"Summary

Summary Companies 9-month ad revenue expected to be flat

Ad markets not yet hit by economic woes

Sees free ITVX appealing to hard-hit viewers















LONDON, July 28 (Reuters) - British commercial broadcaster ITV (ITV.L) expects its soon-to-launch free streaming platform ITVX to resonate with viewers at a time when deteriorating economic conditions have forced many to cancel subscriptions with the likes of Netflix (NFLX.O).

ITV alarmed investors in March when it announced the arrival of ITVX, a major expansion of its primarily ad-funded streaming service backed by a 160 million pound ($195 million) content budget. Its shares fell 27% on the day, and are yet to recover.

The company, whose programmes include reality show ""Love Island"", said the platform would enable it to better compete with rival streaming services, while the content would also be used on its linear TV channels and sold abroad.

It will be free for viewers, or available with a subscription for ad-free viewing. ""As we head into difficult times, that's got to be a compelling reason to watch it,"" Kevin Lygo, head of ITV studios, said.

ITV, Britain's biggest free-to-air commercial broadcaster, said advertising had so far held up well, forecasting flat total ad revenues for the nine-month period, despite a tough comparison with last year's Euros soccer tournament.

It also expects to get a boost from the World Cup in November and December. CEO Carolyn McCall said the group had not yet seen any impact from the weakening economic outlook.

""In terms of the short-term advertising outlook, we're very mindful as you would expect of the UK macro economic factors and also geopolitical uncertainty,"" she told reporters. ""However to date, we've not seen a material impact.""

Following years of stagnant real wage growth and with inflation forecast to hit double figures later this year, Britons are bracing for the tightest economic squeeze since the 1950s. Market data has shown that many have cancelled subscriptions to music and TV sites to save cash.

Netflix, which also competes with the likes of Disney (DIS.N) and Apple , is launching an ad-supported, lower-priced version to plug slowing subscriber growth.

Summary Related documents Apple accused Ericsson of filing secret lawsuits to pressure it into license

Texas judge said Colombian court order did not affect his case















(Reuters) - An East Texas federal court on Thursday rejected Apple Inc's request to have Ericsson Inc cover any losses stemming from a Colombian court order that blocked some iPhone sales there.

Apple, which is locked in a dispute with Ericsson over 5G wireless patents, has accused the company of filing ""secret"" lawsuits against it outside the United States. But Apple failed to show that the Colombian order caused any imminent harm that would justify its request for indemnification, U.S. District Judge Rodney Gilstrap said.

The companies and their attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Ericsson sued Apple in Texas last year, seeking a declaration that it offered Apple fair terms for licenses to its 5G wireless patents as required by international standards groups for certain technologies. According to Apple, the companies agreed that the Marshall, Texas, court would determine the appropriate terms for a global license.

Apple told the court earlier this month that Ericsson filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the company in Colombia without notice, and several more around the world, as part of an effort to make Apple submit to its demands before the December trial in Texas.

Apple said in one of the cases a Bogota court blocked it from selling phones that allegedly infringe an Ericsson 5G patent. Apple asked the Texas court to force Ericsson to cover its expenses resulting from the Colombia order.

Ericsson responded that Apple's rhetoric about its leverage from the order was ""overblown,"" and said that the Colombian case did not affect the Texas case.

Gilstrap said he understood Apple's frustration with Ericsson having ""hop-scotched all over the planet"" filing lawsuits ""as a means to bring pressure"" against it.

""However, the Court simply does not find that Ericsson's actions pose an imminent risk of harm to this court or its management of this case,"" Gilstrap said.

The case is Ericsson Inc v. Apple Inc, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, No. 2:21-cv-00376.

318,207,APPLE,2022-07-29,"Apple faces lukewarm demand in China after quarterly revenue drop, analysts say","













SHANGHAI, July 29 (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) should brace for a weakening of demand in China as shoppers curb spending in an anemic economy, some analysts warned on Friday, after the iPhone maker said demand had rebounded in mid-June after COVID-19 lockdowns hampered sales.

The iPhone maker on Thursday reported quarterly revenue in Greater China fell 1%, snapping a streak of strong quarters in the region. read more

Overall, Apple's revenue rose 2%, beating estimates, and the company said there had been no slowdown in demand for iPhones globally despite macroeconomic indicators turning negative.

Apple boss Tim Cook blamed the drop in Greater China revenue on strict lockdowns in Chinese cities, which forced millions to stay home and hammered the Chinese economy.

""We did see lower demand based on the COVID lockdowns in the cities the COVID lockdowns affected. And we did see a rebound in those same cities toward the end of the quarter in the June time frame,"" he said.

China's strict curbs to stamp out COVID have undercut a recovery in the world's second-largest economy, with consumer confidence hovering near record lows, private investment slowing and youth unemployment at a record 19.3%, prompting calls for more urgent government stimulus. read more

Apple this week announced discounts on iPhones and other hardware for Chinese customers, a move it occasionally makes when sales are slow.

Still, the company is more insulated from a weak economy because it is the only leading brand offering expensive devices, analysts said.

Apple's chief competitor in the high-end segment, Huawei, has seen sales collapse after U.S. sanctions prevented it from sourcing key components. Honor, a Huawei spin-off, is growing fast but is yet to break into the high-end market.

Overall Chinese smartphone sales in April-June fell 14.2% on year and volumes hit a decade low, Counterpoint Research said on Wednesday.

Apple's market share in China rose slightly to 15.5% in the quarter even as its sales volumes dropped 5.8%, Counterpoint said, a smaller blow compared with Oppo, Xiaomi (1810.HK), and vivo.

IDC analyst Will Wong said that unlike in late 2020, when demand for phones in China surged after the first COVID lockdown, phone sales are expected to shrink.

""It's not just the lockdown, but other factors, like the government tech crackdown and the slowdown on the property market, all have a negative effect on consumer sentiment,"" he said.

Apple is set to release a new iPhone model in the autumn.

But sales of the new device in China is unlikely to exceed those of last year's iPhone 13, said Canalys analyst Nicole Peng.

""High-end phone sales tend to be resilient in China, but Apple may worry that demand itself is weakening.""

319,615,APPLE,2022-07-29,Dollar snares U.S. firms in $4 trln endurance test,"













NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The strong dollar is becoming a test of nerves for global companies. From drugmaker Pfizer (PFE.N) to iPhone peddler Apple (AAPL.O) and crafty online marketplace Etsy (ETSY.O), executives say the U.S. currency’s rise to levels not seen in nearly 20 years is cutting into their profit. Some dismal earnings could lie ahead for firms that sell U.S. goods overseas. But weigh up the pros and cons, and the Teflon dollar is still in America’s interest.

The dollar has strengthened more than 15% in a year against an index that includes the yen, pound, Canadian dollar, euro, Swiss franc and Swedish crown – the fastest rate of increase since 2015. For one, the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes, including Wednesday’s 75-basis-point increase, have made holding dollar investments more appealing read more . And when investors fear global disease or war, as they do now, they tend to seek deep, liquid markets. For those, the United States remains nonpareil.

The soaring greenback that results is great for U.S. holidaymakers abroad, but a pain in the neck for American companies with foreign cash flows. Around 30% of the revenue of S&P 500 Index firms comes from outside of the United States according to Morgan Stanley. That’s equivalent to around $4 trillion, based on Refinitiv estimates for this year. Earnings estimates tend to fall as the dollar works its way upwards.

S&P 500 downward EPS estimate revisions as a share of all revisions.

Too much strength for too long could be a problem. Companies that rely on earnings overseas have less to invest once they get the spoils back home. They also have an incentive to relocate production to cheaper countries. That, though, seems less of a risk when part of the dollar’s outperformance comes from abundant risks elsewhere. The euro’s fall reflects not an investment opportunity but a region in turmoil, partly because of soaring energy costs.

That makes the strong dollar mostly a stock-market problem for now. Federal Reserve chief Jay Powell, for example, is unfazed by falling equity markets. President Joe Biden has remained quiet on the currency question, while Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says the rising dollar is “understandable.” A tendency not to meddle in currency markets, and a historical White House preference for a strong dollar, is another reason the United States retains its global investment appeal.

In any case, what companies lose today, they are likely to regain tomorrow. Markets are already pricing in rate cuts in early 2023, suggesting a belief inflation will be under control by then. When that happens, investors are likely to regain their taste for risk and buy back into equities. Companies now singing the strong-dollar blues may change their tune before long.

CONTEXT NEWS

The U.S dollar has strengthened 15% over the past year against a basket of trading-partner currencies, as of July 29. The U.S. dollar index tracks the currency against the euro, yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish crown and Swiss franc.

The annual pace of change of the dollar over the period since April is the fastest rise since September 2015, according to Datastream.

Many global companies have warned that currency moves will eat into their revenue and profit. Apple said on July 29 that foreign exchange wiped 300 basis points off its revenue for the quarter ending in June.

Drugmaker Pfizer warned a day earlier that the strengthening dollar would reduce its revenue for the year by around $2 billion. And Etsy, the online marketplace, told analysts on July 27 that currency moves would shave “several percentage points” from the value of goods sold on its platforms.

Amazon expects higher revenue in third quarter

Intel cuts annual forecasts, shares slide

Oil giants Exxon, Chevron jump after record revenue

Indexes: Dow up 1%, S&P 500 up 1.4%, Nasdaq up 1.9%















NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks added to their recent rally on Friday after upbeat forecasts from Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O), and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their biggest monthly percentage gains since 2020.

Most S&P 500 sectors ended higher, with energy (.SPNY) rising 4.5%, the most of any S&P sector. Chevron Corp (CVX.N) rose 8.9% and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) shares jumped 4.6% after the companies reported record quarterly revenues. read more

Apple Inc shares gained 3.3% after the company said parts shortages were easing and that demand for iPhones was continuing. Amazon.com Inc shot up 10.4% after it forecast a jump in third-quarter revenue from bigger fees from its Prime loyalty subscriptions. read more

""In today's market, the Amazon and Apple numbers are giving the market support (on) the idea that two large companies that are a large part of the S&P seem so far to be able to navigate through these tougher times,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.

Stocks have also rallied this week on investor speculation that the Federal Reserve may not need to be as aggressive with interest rate hikes as some had feared.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 315.5 points, or 0.97%, to 32,845.13; the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 57.86 points, or 1.42%, to 4,130.29 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 228.10 points, or 1.88%, to 12,390.69.

All three major indexes gained for the month and for the week. The S&P 500 gained about 9.1% for July in its biggest monthly percentage gain since November 2020, while the Nasdaq jumped about 12.3% in July in its biggest monthly gain since April 2020.

Second-quarter U.S. corporate results have mostly been stronger than expected.

Of the 279 S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings so far, 77.8% have exceeded expectations. Earnings for S&P 500 companies now are expected to have increased 7.1% in the quarter versus an estimated 5.6% at the start of July, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The day's economic data showed U.S. labor costs increased strongly in the second quarter as a tight jobs market boosted wage growth. read more

But on Thursday, a government report showed the American economy unexpectedly contracted in the second quarter, suggesting to some investors that the economy was on the cusp of a recession. They said it might deter the Fed from continuing to aggressively increase rates as it battles high inflation. read more

REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo















July 29 (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) added about $175 billion to their combined market value on Friday after upbeat results boosted investor confidence on the ability of these firms to weather a slowdown in the economy.

While analysts noted these companies were not completely immune to broader economic hurdles, they said the weakness in consumer spending is not likely to send these firms into the red, deeming them ""always reliable to buck the trend.""

Amazon's shares rose about 11% to $135.50 after the e-commerce titan forecast upbeat third-quarter revenue, while those of Apple rose more than 3% as the company said appetite for iPhones remained strong despite consumers tightening spending.

""The results are good enough to support Apple's stock which has done much better in the current market rout, further justifying the company's 'safe haven' status when the going gets tough,"" Haris Anwar, Investing.com analyst, said.

The U.S. stock market's hyper surge in the past decade has been fuelled by high-growth and megacap companies, but rising interest rates to combat decades-high inflation as well as a sharp rally in the dollar have taken a toll since the start of the year.

Earlier this week, upbeat results from Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) reassured investors burnt by a slump in their shares in the first half of the year.

Amazon, like much of the retail industry, is bracing for a pullback in consumer spending as people stick to lower-priced essentials to tide over economic woes.

The e-commerce giant's booming cloud business, coupled with a ramp up in service offerings, is likely to help cushion the impact of soaring costs.

Kingsview Investment Management portfolio manager Paul Nolte, however, was more skeptical in the light of warnings from some major retailers including Walmart (WMT.N).

""We think that the consumer is not as strong as maybe portrayed by the reaction to Amazon.""

322,169,APPLE,2022-08-01,Apple is sued by French app developers over app store fees,"













Aug 1 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) was sued on Monday by French app developers that accused the iPhone maker of violating U.S. antitrust law by overcharging them to use its app store.

The plaintiffs in the proposed class action include Société du Figaro, which develops the Figaro news app; L'Équipe 24/24, which develops the L'Équipe sports news and streaming app, and Le Geste, an association of French content providers.

According to the complaint filed in the federal court in Oakland, California, Apple has abused its monopoly power over app distribution on iOS-based mobile devices by mandating only one app store for those devices.

The plaintiffs said this has enabled the Cupertino, California-based company to charge ""supracompetitive"" 30% commissions for 14 years, as well as $99 annual fees to app developers, while stifling innovation and consumer choice.

""There is no valid business necessity or pro-competitive justification for Apple's conduct,"" the complaint said. ""Instead, Apple's actions are designed to destroy competition.""

Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Monday's complaint seeks an injunction against further anticompetitive conduct, plus triple damages for violating federal antitrust law and California state laws.

The plaintiffs are represented by the U.S. law firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, and Paris-based Fayrouze Masmi-Dazi.

Monday's lawsuit resembles an earlier Hagens Berman case against Apple, which resulted last August in a $100 million settlement for smaller iOS developers that called Apple's commissions excessive. read more

In June, the firm reached a $90 million settlement with Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google over its app store's treatment of developers. read more

323,360,APPLE,2022-08-01,Big Tech in finance? There’s a regulator for that,"













WASHINGTON, Aug 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Technology companies have stormed the heights of consumer finance, but they don’t face the regulation that vexes their old-world rivals. While no single financial watchdog has oversight of Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O) or Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O), that could change. It all hangs on the views of a panel of watchdogs known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council.

When a company like Apple decides to offer financial services, the potential impact is huge. Take the iPhone maker’s new buy-now-pay-later service. It’s starting small, with six-week duration loans and a borrowing limit of $1,000. But unlike the Apple-branded credit card that’s effectively run by Goldman Sachs (GS.N), the lending decisions and funding for buy-now-pay-later loans are Apple’s own. Tim Cook’s firm is doing some of what a Citigroup (C.N) or Bank of America (BAC.N) does, but without the onerous regulation.

It's a question of potential rather than actual risk. Imagine half the number of iPhone users in the United States, or about 59 million based on estimates by Counterpoint research, end up using the pay-installment service. That would give Apple about as many consumer customers as General Electric’s (GE.N) financing arm, GE Capital, had in 2013. GE Capital required a bailout to back nearly $140 billion of its debt after it unraveled during the 2008 financial crisis.

The cloud divisions of Silicon Valley giants also play a systemic role. The largest banks like JPMorgan (JPM.N) rely on Amazon and others for various tasks, including housing data, processing transactions and running applications. About 45% of banks use Amazon while a similar proportion depends on Microsoft (MSFT.O), with many using both, according to S&P Global’s 451 Research. A disruption or failure through a hack or natural disaster could upend operations and cause a panic.

In GE’s case, it was FSOC that stepped in when it became clear that the regulatory framework had holes in it. The 15-member panel was created after the 2008 financial crisis, and now includes Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell, Securities and Exchange Commission chief Gary Gensler and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau head Rohit Chopra. The council designated GE Capital a systemic risk in 2013, and put it under the supervision of the Fed, where it stayed until 2016.

Tech companies would be a timely fit for FSOC. The group doesn’t perform day-to-day watchdog functions but can farm such duties out to an appropriate panel member. The Fed also took supervision of insurer AIG (AIG.N) after the 2008 financial crisis. Other FSOC members have their own expertise: the SEC’s is over capital markets, for example.

And as with GE, it wouldn’t need to throw a regulatory net around the whole of a company. Apple, say, could be asked to carve out its Apple Financing subsidiary into a separate holding company, which could then be subject to rules on underwriting, credit quality and stress testing. Cloud businesses like Amazon Web Service or Microsoft Azure could be deemed systemically important financial utilities, a label already applied to other forms of market plumbing like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

None of this would stop tech firms’ financial march, but it would slow them down. Regulated entities would need to have their own chief executive, board and come up with rules on cybersecurity and other areas. British authorities recently floated a range of options to make sure the financial system could withstand a cloud-computing snafu, including regular cyber resilience tests. And financial regulators often parachute examiners into the offices of the companies they supervise, who regularly check operations for risk management. That would be an unfamiliar intrusion for Silicon Valley.

Even if FSOC drags its feet, more red tape for tech firms is inevitable. In October, the CFPB asked Apple, Alphabet’s (GOOGL.O) Google, and Facebook about their payment systems. The agency can issue enforcement actions for violations of user privacy, among other concerns, and leader Chopra is no stranger to assertively using his position on other regulatory bodies – as he showed when he helped speed the exit of then-head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Donald Trump appointee Jelena McWilliams.

Still, a more coordinated approach would be better. With billions of users and lax regulation, the risks to consumers and the broader system from big tech firms are growing. Watchdogs, meanwhile, are often reacting to past threats. Putting Silicon Valley on FSOC’s agenda would help keep the financial cops ahead of the game.

325,723,APPLE,2022-08-02,"U.S. corporate profits, economic outlooks, surprisingly upbeat","













NEW YORK, Aug 2 (Reuters) - U.S. companies are reporting mostly upbeat news this earnings season, surprising investors who had been bracing for a gloomier outlook on both businesses and the economy.

More than halfway into the second-quarter reporting period, S&P 500 company earnings are estimated to have increased 8.1% over the year-ago quarter, compared with a 5.6% estimate at the start of July, according to IBES data from Refinitiv as of Tuesday.

Some 78% of earnings reports are beating Wall Street expectations, above the long-term average.

Profit growth estimates for the third and fourth quarters have come down, but remain sharply positive. S&P 500 earnings for all of 2022 are now forecast to grow 8.1% versus a 9.5% estimated in July, based on Refinitiv data.

Investors had been worried that if high inflation and rising interest rates were about to tip the economy into recession, earnings estimates for 2022 were too high.

Raising the risk that the economy was on the cusp of a recession, the U.S. Commerce Department said last week the American economy unexpectedly contracted in the second quarter - the second straight quarterly decline in gross domestic product. read more

Concerns over a possible recession had driven a sharp selloff in stocks in the first half of the year. But the S&P 500 (.SPX) and Nasdaq (.IXIC) ended July with their biggest monthly percentage gains since 2020, partly because of stronger-than-expected earnings.

""The consensus view (was) that earnings were going to just fall apart,"" said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist & head of quantitative research at Credit Suisse Securities. ""And it just didn't play out that way.""

Company reports are showing that demand remains robust and sales are holding up, he said.

""If you want to say, what's the health of the economy, it's measured in sales,"" Golub said.

Year-over-year revenue for S&P 500 companies in the quarter is expected to have risen 12.5% as of Tuesday, compared with 10.4% estimated at the start of July, based on Refinitiv data.

Upbeat forecasts from heavyweights Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) boosted investors' mood late last week, while Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) reported record quarterly revenues.

Apple said parts shortages were easing and that demand for iPhones was continuing, while Amazon.com forecast a jump in third-quarter revenue.

Heading into earnings, concerns had been growing over how big technology and other growth names could handle higher interest rates and a possible recession, and results so far from companies have mostly helped to give investors confidence in their outlook. read more

Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) report ""dispelled some of the fears about ad spending,"" and other areas, said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments in Atlanta.

To be sure, the news has not been positive all around. Walmart (WMT.N)rattled investors early last week when it cut its full-year profit forecast, blaming surging prices for food and fuel. read more

That's raised worried about the health of the consumer and prospects for other retailers, most of which have yet to report results on the last quarter.

Also, analysts have been cutting their third-quarter earnings growth estimates by more than usual when compared with ""either pre-pandemic or over the last two years,"" Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a note this week.

Whether earnings forecasts hold up is key to valuations. The S&P 500's forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio, at 17.5 as of Tuesday, is down from 22.1 at the end of December but still above the long-term average of about 16, Refinitiv data showed.

Other strategists said the season is following a normal pattern: Companies often are more negative than positive with their outlooks, so earnings forecasts for upcoming quarters tend to go down typically during a reporting period.

Negative outlooks from S&P 500 companies on the third quarter so far are running only slightly above positive ones, based on Refinitiv data.

""So far, what's happened isn't something that's worse than feared. And the market was already braced for bad news,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services in Atlanta.

""Don't hesitate to continue wearing a face mask if you feel more comfortable doing so,"" the report quoted Apple as saying in the internal email. ""Also, please respect every individual's decision to wear a mask or not.""

Summary

Summary Companies Any US export block may affect global chip supply -analysts

Move would hinder Samsung, SK Hynix upgrading China plants

Samsung, SK Hynix together supply over 50% of global NAND chips

Curbs could change where future chip plants are built -analyst















SEOUL, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Export restrictions being considered by Washington to halt China's advances in semiconductor manufacturing could come at a substantial cost, experts say, potentially disrupting fragile global chip supply chains - and hurting U.S. businesses.

Reuters reported on Monday that the United States is considering limiting shipments of American chipmaking equipment to memory chip producers in China that make advanced semiconductors used in everything from smartphones to data centres. read more

The curbs would stop chipmakers like South Korean giants Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and SK Hynix (000660.KS) from shipping new technology tools to factories they operate in China, preventing them from upgrading plants that serve customers around the world.

Samsung and SK Hynix, which control more than half of the global NAND flash memory chip market, have invested heavily in China in recent decades to produce chips that are vital to customers including tech giants Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Facebook owner Meta (META.O) and Google (GOOGL.O). As well as computers and phones, the chips are used in products like electric vehicles that require digital data storage.

""Samsung's China production alone accounts for more than 15% of global NAND flash production ... If there's any production disruption, it will make chip prices surge,"" said Lee Min-hee, analyst at BNK Securities.

The potential for fresh turmoil - the curbs have yet to be approved - comes just as a global chip supply shortage that has disrupted businesses from autos to consumer devices for more than a year is finally showing signs of easing. Supply chain adjustments and weakening consumer demand amid the slowing global economy have combined to repair damage. read more

But the shortage has yet to be fully resolved. Any signs of fresh disruption could rekindle supply uncertainty, triggering a price surge - as seen earlier this year when China imposed COVID-19 restrictions in Xian where Samsung manufactures chips. read more

Chipmaking equipment has to be installed and fully tested months before production is due to start. Any delay in shipping the gear to China would pose a real challenge to chipmakers as they seek to manufacture more advanced chips in China facilities.

""Many U.S. companies, like Apple, use Samsung and SK Hynix memory chips. No matter what strategy (the South Korean firms) end up choosing, it will have global implications,"" said BNK Securities analyst Lee.

Samsung and SK Hynix declined to comment. Apple, Amazon, Meta and Google didn't respond to emails seeking comment outside regular U.S. business hours.

AMBITIONS, COMPLICATIONS

In Samsung's memory chip operation in Xian, central China, one of the largest foreign chip projects in the country, the company has invested a total of about $26 billion since it broke ground on the site in 2012, including chip production as well as testing and packaging.

The tech giant makes 128-layer NAND flash products in Xian, analysts said, chips that store data in devices such as smartphones and personal computers, as well as in data centres.

The facility accounts for 43% of Samsung's global NAND flash memory production capacity and 15% of the overall global output capacity, according to TrendForce late last year. read more

The U.S. crackdown, if approved, could also complicate SK Hynix's ambition to expand its presence in the NAND market where it is ranked third as of first quarter behind Samsung and Japan's Kioxia Holdings, which was spun out of Toshiba Corp (6502.T).

SK Hynix completed late last year the first phase of its $9 billion purchase of Intel's (INTC.O) NAND business, including its Dalian, China NAND manufacturing facility. read more

CHINA STRATEGIES

The move being considered by the United States is one of several recent signs of deepening tensions between Beijing and Washington over the tech sector.

Congress last week approved legislation to subsidise semiconductor production in the United States. It bars any company that receives federal subsidies from investing in certain chip technology in China during the subsidy period. read more

The deepening tensions could leave Samsung and SK Hynix having to review strategies on China investments, analysts and industry sources said.

""Until now, companies tended to invest in countries like China, where costs were cheap,"" said Kim Yang-jae, analyst at Daol Investment & Securities.

""That's no longer going to be the only consideration. The biggest change these potential limits will bring will be where the next chip factories are built.""

They could also face potentially diminishing returns from their multi-billion dollar China plants, which could be stuck making older-technology, less lucrative chips.

SK Hynix has not been able to upgrade its DRAM memory chip production facilities in Wuxi, China with the latest extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) chipmaking machines made by Dutch firm ASML (ASML.AS) as U.S. officials do not want advanced equipment used in the process to enter the country. read more

The EUV machines are used to make more advanced and smaller chips that are used in high-end devices such as smartphones.

328,532,APPLE,2022-08-03,Factbox: Sanctions China has imposed on Taiwan over Pelosi visit,"













BEIJING, Aug 3 (Reuters) - China on Wednesday suspended exports of natural sand to Taiwan and halted imports of fruit and fish products from the self-governed island as U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in a trip condemned by Beijing. read more

In a warning salvo ahead of Pelosi's visit, Chinese customs had suspended imports from 35 Taiwanese exporters of biscuits and pastries since Monday. read more

In January-June, China's imports from Taiwan reached $122.5 billion, up 7.3% from a year earlier, Chinese customs data showed. Top imported goods included integrated circuits and electronic components.

NATURAL SAND

China's commerce ministry said exports of natural sand - widely used for construction and in concrete - to Taiwan were suspended from Wednesday.

Such a move was based on laws and regulations, the ministry said, without elaborating.

In March 2007, China halted exports of natural sand to Taiwan due to environmental concerns. The ban lasted for a year. According to Chinese official data, more than 90% of Taiwan's natural sand imports came from China in 2007.

FRUIT AND FISH

China also halted imports of citrus fruit, chilled white striped hairtail and frozen horse mackerel from Taiwan from Wednesday, a suspension which it said was due to pesticide residue found on citrus fruit, while traces of the novel coronavirus were detected on the packaging of some frozen fish products in June.

China's top food and agricultural imports from Taiwan include seafood, coffee, dairy products, beverages and vinegar.

In January-June, China's biggest agricultural and food import items from Taiwan were fish and other aquatic invertebrates, reaching 399 million yuan ($59 million).

Earlier this year, China suspended imports of grouper fish from Taiwan, saying it had detected banned chemicals.

Last year, Beijing also suspended pineapple, sugar apple and wax apple imports from the island, citing pest concerns. read more

TWO FOUNDATIONS

China also vowed to take ""disciplinary actions"" against two Taiwan foundations which it claimed had aggressively engaged in pro-independence separatist activities.

The two foundations - Taiwan Foundation for Democracy and Taiwan Foreign Ministry's International Cooperation and Development Fund - will be banned from cooperating with any organisations, companies and individuals in the mainland, China's state news agency Xinhua on Wednesday cited Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman of China's Taiwan Affairs Office, as saying.

China will punish any mainland organisations, companies and individuals that provide financial support to or serve the two foundations, Xinhua reported, adding other measures will be adopted if necessary.

In addition, any deal or cooperation between four specific Taiwanese firms and mainland companies are not allowed due to their donations to the two foundations.

Executives at the four Taiwanese companies - solar producer Speedtech Energy Co., Hyweb Technology Co., medical equipment producer Skyla, and cold chain vehicle fleet management company SkyEyes - will be prohibited from entering mainland China.

Aug 4 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) credit card business is being investigated by a top U.S. consumer watchdog, the bank disclosed in a regulatory filing on Thursday.

The investigation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) includes scrutiny of the bank's credit card account management practices, refunds and billing error resolution, according to the filing.

Goldman said it was cooperating with the CFPB. (https://bit.ly/3PY9wBu)

Under its chief executive officer, David Solomon, the bank has been looking to expand its consumer business as it seeks to diversify its revenue streams beyond trading and investment banking.

The bank has a credit card partnership with Apple Inc (AAPL.O), following the launch of a card with the iPhone maker in 2019. It also offers a co-branded credit card with General Motors Co (GM.N).

The Wall Street giant also said it had reduced its credit exposure to Russia by over 13% in the second quarter. Citigroup Inc (C.N), on the other hand, saw its Russia exposure climb by $500 million as the rouble firmed. read more

Summary Companies reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=cpurl://apps.cp./Apps/econ-polls?RIC=TWCPIY%3DECI

Exports median forecast 11.65% y/y (prior month +15.2%)

Imports median forecast 15.85% y/y (prior month +19.2%)

Balance median forecast $4.49 bln (prior month $4.64 bln)

CPI median forecast 3.51% y/y (prior month +3.59%)















TAIPEI, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Taiwan's exports likely rose for the 25th straight month in July though at a slower pace than in June, amid fears of a global recession, uncertainties due to the Ukraine conflict and COVID-19 flare-ups in China, according to a Reuters poll.

Taiwan, a global hub for chip production and a key supplier to Apple Inc (AAPL.O), is one of Asia's leading exporters of technology goods, with the trade data seen as an important gauge of world demand for tech gadgets.

Exports last month were estimated to have risen 11.65% from a year earlier, a Reuters poll of 10 analysts showed on Thursday, slower than the 15.2% jump in June. read more

The export forecasts ranged between 4.5% and 19.0% higher, reflecting uncertainties over the global economic recovery, supply chain disruptions due to pandemic lockdowns in eastern China and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Taiwan's Finance Ministry predicted July exports to increase by 10% to 13% from a year earlier.

Separately, the consumer price index was expected to have risen 3.51% in July from a year earlier, a slightly slower rate than 3.59% in June.

The inflation data will be released on Friday, followed by trade data on Monday.

NEW YORK, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Britain's Emma Raducanu said she was not feeling under pressure less than a month before she returns to New York with a target on her back in her U.S. Open title defence.

Teenager Raducanu completed one of tennis' most remarkable feats a year ago at Flushing Meadows when the 150th-ranked qualifier swatted aside vastly more experienced opponents on her way to becoming a Grand Slam champion. read more

The triumph captured the imagination of an adoring British public but she has not won a tournament since, retiring injured in Rome in May and at Nottingham in June and exiting both Roland-Garros and Wimbledon in the second round.

While a return to the raucous crowds of the Big Apple could shake even veteran competitors, the 19-year-old told Sky Sports the only pressure she feels comes from herself and the media.

""(Pressure) is only either what I put on myself or what I expect from myself. I only feel the pressure or think about it whenever I'm in my press conferences because every single question is about pressure,"" Raducanu said.

The 10th-ranked Briton most recently lost in the Citi Open quarter-finals to lower ranked Liudmila Samsonova, and said she saw this year's U.S. Open as an opportunity to start afresh.

""I'm really looking forward to just going back (to New York) and whatever happens I think that it's going to be a nice close to a chapter, go full circle,"" she said.

""Regardless of whatever the result is I can just start again, clean slate. If all my points drop off then I'll work my way back up. I think it will be, regardless of what happens, (a) fresh start.""

334,564,APPLE,2022-08-08,Putin allows Russian banks under sanctions to halt some FX operations,"Summary This content was produced in Russia where the law restricts coverage of Russian military operations in Ukraine















MOSCOW, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Russian banks that have their foreign currency funds frozen due to western sanctions can suspend operations in such currencies with their corporate clients, according to a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin on Monday.

Russian authorities have stepped up the process of reducing the use of currencies of countries designated as ""unfriendly"" countries since Western countries imposed extensive sanctions after Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Putin's decree said the new measures could stay in place until sanctions that impaired transactions in foreign currencies were lifted.

The sanctions have limited the foreign currency transfers that Russian banks can make from one to another.

Many have been cut off from the SWIFT global payments system, while Apple and Google withdrew access in Russia to their digital payments systems and Russians can no longer use Mastercard and Visa cards abroad.

With their already limited cash holdings of hard currency, Russian banks have few options for investing foreign currencies because of capital controls in Russia and the risk of funds abroad being frozen. These factors have caused some to introduce fees and commissions.

Russian authorities have voiced concerns about individual and corporate holdings of dollars and other so-called ""unfriendly"" currencies, calling for their conversion into alternative currencies and assets. read more

335,582,APPLE,2022-08-08,Japanese investors were big buyers of foreign equities in July,"













Aug 8 (Reuters) - Japanese investors purchased heavily in foreign equities in July, as global stocks rebounded last month on the back of positive earnings and hopes of less aggressive monetary tightening measures from the U.S. Federal Reserves.

According to data from Japan's Ministry of Finance, Japanese investors accumulated a net 1.85 trillion yen worth of overseas equities in July, the biggest since at least 2005.

U.S. equities (.SPX) gained 9.1% in the last month, boosted by postive forecasts from Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc , which showed confidence in companies ability to weather an economic downturn.

The overseas equity buying was led by investment trusts, which purchased 755.4 billion yen, while trust banks bought 748.6 billion yen.

According to Refinitiv data, 66% of the MSCI World index constituents have beaten analysts' forecasts for their net income.

Meanwhile, due to a decline in U.S. yields, Japanese investors made net sales of 2.54 trillion yen worth of foreign bonds in July, making it a sixth straight month of net sales.

In June, domestic investors sold 3.88 trillion-yen worth of U.S. bonds and 926.8 billion-yen worth of European bonds, data from the Bank of Japan showed.

336,836,APPLE,2022-08-09,Foxconn to build autonomous electric tractors at Ohio facility,"













Aug 9 (Reuters) - Taiwan's Foxconn (2317.TW), the world's largest contract electronics maker, on Tuesday said it will build driverless electric tractors for California-based Monarch Tractor at its Lordstown, Ohio, facility starting in early 2023.

The announcement comes as heavy machinery manufacturers, including Deere & Co (DE.N) and Georgia-based AGCO (AGCO.N), set their sights on the electric vehicle market as the U.S. agriculture industry shifts to smart farming. read more

The agreement with Monarch Tractor is the first manufacturing contract Foxconn, best known for assembling Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhone, has entered since purchasing the Ohio facility that was formerly a General Motors (GM.N) Assembly plant last year. read more

Production for Monarch's battery powered MK-V series tractor is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2023, said Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Technology Group.

Monarch, which is based in Silicon Valley, debuted its first pilot series, autonomous electric tractor to a select group of farmers last year. The company has since entered into a multi-year licensing agreement with Italian-American vehicle manufacturer CNH Industrial . read more

CNH Industrial has a minority stake in Monarch Tractor.

With competition brewing among farm equipment manufacturers to expand product lines in precision agriculture technology and autonomous machinery, Monarch's chief executive, Praveen Penmetsa, told Reuters that the company's business model to target smaller farmers gives them unique opportunity to increase the marketshare while being on the same playing field with bigger manufacturers.

""Their technology is focused on the large farm operations and commodity crops. Fruits and vegetable farmers use much smaller tractors so we are focused on smaller farmers - that differentiates us a lot,"" Penmetsa said.

The company did not disclose the cost of the tractor but said the autonomous software will be sold separately and that farmers will have to pay a monthly fee to access the services.

338,333,APPLE,2022-08-09,South Korea to probe app store operators over suspected in-app payment violations,"













SEOUL, Aug 9 (Reuters) - South Korea's telecommunications regulator said on Tuesday it plans to launch an investigation into app store operators such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Alphabet's Google and One Store over suspected violations of in-app payment law.

Potential fines for infractions could be as high as 2% of the average annual revenue from related business practices, the law says. The regulator didn't specify the scale of any possible fines in this instance.

Under the law passed last year and in effect since March, major app store operators such as Google and Apple are banned from forcing software developers to use their payment systems. read more

The Korea Communications Commissions (KCC) said in a statement it had conducted an inspection since May 17 to determine whether Google, Apple and One Store had violated the rules and had determined that all three might have done so.

In a statement, a Google spokesperson said: “We have worked closely with government stakeholders and our developer community to expand user choice in Korea in compliance with the new law, while continuing to ensure we can invest in the ecosystem and provide a safe and high quality experience for all.

""As we have at each stage of this process, we’ll continue to cooperate with the KCC.""

Apple and One Store were not immediately available for comment when contacted by Reuters.

The KCC added that it plans to take strict measures such as correction orders or imposing fines if the probe finds barred activities.

Barred acts include app market operators unfairly delaying the review of mobile content, or refusing, delaying, restricting, deleting, or blocking the registration, renewal, or inspection of mobile content that uses third-party payment methods.

SEOUL, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) unveiled its latest high-end foldable smartphones on Wednesday, keeping prices at the same level as last year's in a bid to cement its leadership in an expanding niche market.

The smartphone maker priced its clamshell Galaxy Z Flip4 at $999.99, and the 5G-enabled top-line Galaxy Z Fold4 with a 7.6-inch main screen to start at $1,799.99 in the United States, the same as the launch prices of last year's models.

""We've successfully transformed this category from a radical project to a mainstream device lineup enjoyed by millions worldwide,"" said TM Roh, president and head of mobile experience at Samsung Electronics.

The Galaxy Z Flip4 and Z Fold4, as well as its latest earbuds, Galaxy Buds2 Pro, will be generally available starting Aug. 26 in select places such as the United States, parts of Europe and South Korea.

Counterpoint Research forecast global shipments of foldable smartphones to grow to 16 million units this year, just 1.2% of the 1.36 billion smartphone shipments forecast, but a jump from 9 million foldables shipped last year.

Although the overall smartphone market is seen shrinking this year as consumers spend less, foldable smartphones are likely to fare better, as their quirky form factor, large screens and portability attract interest, analysts said.

Samsung held a 62% market share in foldable smartphones in the first half of 2022, followed by Huawei at 16% and Oppo at 3%. Counterpoint forecast Samsung's share in the second half will be around 80% after the new releases.

Samsung said it is aiming for foldable phone sales to surpass that of its past flagship smartphone, Galaxy Note, in the second half. read more

""Foldables have helped Samsung differentiate itself... Apple will be Samsung's key competitor in the future and we expect a foldable to be released from Apple in either 2024 or 2025,"" said Counterpoint senior analyst Jene Park.

Samsung said the latest models make it easier for phone owners to use popular apps such as Instagram and Microsoft's (MSFT.O) Outlook.

340,687,APPLE,2022-08-10,Explainer: How could the new U.S. corporate minimum tax affect companies?,"













WASHINGTON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The main revenue source in the U.S. Senate's newly passed tax, climate and drugs bill is a novel 15% corporate minimum tax aimed at stopping large, profitable companies from gaming the Internal Revenue Service code to slash their tax bills to zero.

The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the new tax will add around $222 billion to U.S. government coffers over the next 10 years, down from a previous projection of $313 billion after last-minute changes to the bill. It will apply to companies with more than $1 billion in ""book income,"" the profits they report to shareholders before the effects of tax deductions and credits.

Here are some key details on how it would work:

What is the corporate minimum tax?

A wealth of deductions, credits and loopholes in the federal tax code has allowed some companies to report no income or negative income to the IRS while reporting strong profits to shareholders. Democratic President Joe Biden has repeatedly singled out Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) for paying little to no federal income tax despite billions of dollars in profits. read more

If enacted, the tax will serve as a corporate version of the Alternative Minimum Tax for individuals, which prevents the wealthiest Americans from zeroing out their tax bills with investment losses and other deductions and credits.

The tax would likely apply to around 150 of the world's largest companies, according to a Joint Committee on Taxation analysis. These include large pharmaceutical companies and major corporations like Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Nike Inc (NKE.N), according to several think tanks that support the new tax. Amazon declined to comment on a potential tax increase. Apple, Exxon Mobil and Nike did not respond to requests for comment.

Companies that meet this threshold must calculate their taxes under both the 21% income tax regime and the 15% corporate minimum tax regime -- and pay the higher bill.

The tax would take effect next year and affect companies that earned an average of $1 billion in book income for three consecutive years. It would also apply to foreign companies that earn $100 million of book income in the United States.

What are the exceptions for companies?

Some regular corporate income tax credits and deductions are still allowed under the minimum tax, including credits for foreign taxes paid. The carrying forward of prior-year losses to offset future income is also permitted, but only 80% can be applied to reducing taxable income. Credits for research and development expenses are also allowed, with 75% of the value applied to reducing corporate minimum tax.

At the urging of Democratic Senator Kyrsten Sinema, lawmakers added a provision to preserve deductions on capital investments such as machinery, vehicles and buildings. The exception would allow companies to more quickly offset these expenses against tax bills.

Under another last-minute change to the legislation urged by Sinema, companies controlled by private equity firms are not subject to the corporate minimum tax if they make less than $1 billion of book income, even if that investment firm's combined portfolio of companies exceeds the threshold. Some private equity firms may be able to shift assets among companies in their portfolios so that each earns less than the $1 billion threshold to avoid the minimum tax.

Book income is calculated based on the income companies report to shareholders, and the new tax may give companies an incentive to lower the book income they report, law firm Baker Hostetler said in a recent note. They pointed to a nonpartisan Congressional Research Service report showing evidence of how past efforts to levy taxes based on book income compelled corporate taxpayers to manage their earnings and adjust book income to reduce taxes.

Large companies also could try to lobby the nongovernmental Financial Accounting Standards Board for favorable changes to the rules for calculating book income.

Aug 10 (Reuters) - Bumble Inc (BMBL.O) cut its full-year revenue forecast on Wednesday, taking a hit from the war in Ukraine while also grappling with stiff competition from rivals such as Match Group Inc (MTCH.O) in the online dating market.

Shares of Austin, Texas-based Bumble fell nearly 13% in after-hours trading, as its current-quarter forecast also remained below Wall Street estimates.

While Bumble has experienced a surge in popularity, its other dating app, Badoo, which is mostly used in Western Europe by the urban middle class segment, remains under pressure.

Bumble exited Russia and Belarus earlier this year following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, removing all of its apps from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store in those countries. read more

The impact from the war is expected to dent full-year revenue by $20 million, primarily in Badoo and other apps, at a time when Bumble is already playing catch-up with Tinder owner Match in the European market.

""It has been a challenging first half for Badoo... As Badoo serves a more economically sensitive user base, it has also felt the effects of COVID and now the macro environment, much more than Bumble app,"" Chief Executive Officer Whitney Wolfe Herd said on an earnings call.

Bumble now expects annual revenue between $920 million and $930 million for 2022, lower than its prior estimate of $934 million to $944 million and also below market estimates for $934.1 million, according to Refinitiv data.

While the Bumble app's paying users surged 31% to 1.9 million in the quarter ended June 30, Badoo and other apps saw a cumulative slide of about 25% to 1.1 million.

Bumble's revenue rose 18.4% to $220.5 million in the quarter, edging past analysts' estimate of $219.4 million, while a loss of 3 cents per share came in wider than estimates for a 1-cent loss.

Aug 10 (Reuters) - Taiwan's national security officials want to persuade Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) supplier Foxconn (2317.TW) to unwind an $800 million investment in Chinese chipmaker Tsinghua Unigroup, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday.

The deal will definitely not go through, the report said, citing a senior Taiwanese government official involved in national security issues. (https://on.ft.com/3A8mzuM)

Taiwan, the world's largest contract electronics maker, has become increasingly cautious about China's ambition to boost its semiconductor sector. It has proposed new laws to prevent what it says is China stealing its chip technology, amid rising concerns in Taipei that Beijing is stepping up its economic espionage. read more

The island's government prohibits companies from building their most advanced foundries in China to ensure they do not offshore their best technology.

Taiwan faces mounting pressure from China, which considers the democratically governed island its own territory.

Taiwan's cabinet commission has yet to formally review the investments, the FT report on Wednesday quoted an unnamed person who was briefed on the matter as saying, adding that officials from the National Security Council and the Mainland Affairs Council believe the deal needs to be blocked.

Foxconn said in a statement it has submitted reports to Taiwan authorities about the investment and will continue to talk to government officials. It did not elaborate.

Tsinghua Unigroup did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

It is clear that they have elevated this to the national security level and the prospects are getting dimmed, the FT report cited one person close to the company as saying and added that the deal looks more difficult to pass through with increasing tensions in the Taiwan Strait.

Tensions have escalated in the Taiwan Strait after U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the Chinese-claimed self-ruled island last week, a move that Beijing condemned as a threat to peace and stability. read more

Last month, Foxconn said it was a shareholder in embattled chip conglomerate Tsinghua Unigroup via a $798 million investment by a subsidiary. read more

Summary Law firms Enjoy Technology filed for bankruptcy 9 months after going public

Enjoy canceled a planned auction after no one outbid Asurion's initial offer















(Reuters) - Online retailer Enjoy Technology Inc received approval from a U.S. bankruptcy court on Friday to sell its business to technology repair company Asurion LLC for $110 million.

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Kate Stickles in Wilmington, Delaware, signed off on the sale at a hearing on Friday, saying it was a reasonable exercise of the debtor's business judgment and was a fair, arms-length transaction.

Enjoy, a Palo Alto, California-based startup, filed for bankruptcy protection on June 30 with $26 million in debt. Asurion offered to provide the company with a $55 million bankruptcy loan and to buy it.

Enjoy had contacted more than 30 other potential suitors since filing for bankruptcy, but it canceled a planned auction after none of them chose to outbid Asurion.

Founded in 2014 by former Apple Inc and JCPenney Co executive Ron Johnson, the company filed for Chapter 11 protection fewer than nine months after going public through a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC).

Enjoy sells smartphones and other technology products in the U.S., U.K. and Canada, delivering products and providing tech support to customers' homes.

Enjoy attributed its bankruptcy filing to declining liquidity, in part because a large number of SPAC investors took back money they had committed to Enjoy. The SPAC transaction allowed the company to raise money by offering redeemable equity shares for sale, but that funding source tightened up when a larger-than-expected number of investors exercised their redemption rights rather than continuing to hold shares in the company.

Enjoy also blamed the ""supply chain crisis"" and an inability to retain staff as reasons for its filing. Enjoy entered bankruptcy with just $523,000 of cash on hand, according to court filings.

SPACs, or blank-check companies, are listed shell entities that let sponsors take private companies public faster than through traditional initial public offerings.

Many investors are pulling back from SPACs as the vehicles, which critics say are prone to conflicts of interest and shoddy due diligence, face tighter regulatory scrutiny.

The case is Enjoy Technology LLC, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, No. 22-10580.

345,665,APPLE,2022-08-12,Explainer: How could the new U.S. corporate minimum tax affect companies?,"













Aug 12 (Reuters) - The main revenue source in the new U.S. tax, climate and drugs bill is a novel 15% corporate minimum tax aimed at stopping large, profitable companies from gaming the Internal Revenue Service code and slashing their tax bills to zero.

The U.S. House of Representatives was scheduled to vote on Friday on the $430 billion legislation and send it to President Joe Biden's desk for signing into law, a political triumph for his Democratic Party ahead of the Nov. 8 midterm election.

The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the new tax will add around $222 billion to U.S. government coffers over the next 10 years, down from a previous projection of $313 billion after last-minute changes to the bill. It will apply to companies with more than $1 billion in ""book income,"" the profits they report to shareholders before the effects of tax deductions and credits.

Here are some key details on how it would work:

What is the corporate minimum tax?

A wealth of deductions, credits and loopholes in the federal tax code has allowed some companies to report no income or negative income to the IRS while reporting strong profits to shareholders. Biden has repeatedly singled out Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) for paying little to no federal income tax despite billions of dollars in profits. read more

If enacted, the tax will serve as a corporate version of the Alternative Minimum Tax for individuals, which prevents the wealthiest Americans from zeroing out their tax bills with investment losses and other deductions and credits.

The tax would likely apply to around 150 of the world's largest companies, according to a Joint Committee on Taxation analysis. These include large pharmaceutical companies and major corporations like Amazon, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Nike Inc (NKE.N), according to several think tanks that support the new tax. Amazon declined to comment on a potential tax increase. Apple, Exxon Mobil and Nike did not respond to requests for comment.

Companies that meet this threshold must calculate their taxes under both the 21% income tax regime and the 15% corporate minimum tax regime - and pay the higher bill.

The tax would take effect next year and affect companies that earned an average of $1 billion in book income for three consecutive years. It would also apply to foreign companies that earn $100 million of book income in the United States.

What are the exceptions for companies?

Some regular corporate income tax credits and deductions are still allowed under the minimum tax, including credits for foreign taxes paid. The carrying forward of prior-year losses to offset future income is also permitted, but only 80% can be applied to reducing taxable income. Credits for research and development expenses are also allowed, with 75% of the value applied to reducing corporate minimum tax.

At the urging of Democratic Senator Kyrsten Sinema, lawmakers added a provision to preserve deductions on capital investments such as machinery, vehicles and buildings. The exception would allow companies to more quickly offset these expenses against tax bills.

Under another last-minute change to the legislation urged by Sinema, companies controlled by private equity firms are not subject to the corporate minimum tax if they make less than $1 billion of book income, even if that investment firm's combined portfolio of companies exceeds the threshold. Some private equity firms may be able to shift assets among companies in their portfolios so that each earns less than the $1 billion threshold to avoid the minimum tax.

Book income is calculated based on the income companies report to shareholders, and the new tax may give companies an incentive to lower the book income they report, law firm BakerHostetler said in a recent note. They pointed to a nonpartisan Congressional Research Service report showing evidence of how past efforts to levy taxes based on book income compelled corporate taxpayers to manage their earnings and adjust book income to reduce taxes.

Large companies also could try to lobby the nongovernmental Financial Accounting Standards Board for favorable changes to the rules for calculating book income.

346,498,APPLE,2022-08-15,Caste in California: Tech giants confront ancient Indian hierarchy,"[1/2] Guests arrive for at the Steve Jobs Theater for an Apple event at their headquarters in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 10, 2019. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo















OAKLAND, Calif, Aug 15 (Reuters) - America's tech giants are taking a modern-day crash course in India's ancient caste system, with Apple (AAPL.O) emerging as an early leader in policies to rid Silicon Valley of a rigid hierarchy that's segregated Indians for generations.

Apple, the world's biggest listed company, updated its general employee conduct policy about two years ago to explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of caste, which it added alongside existing categories such as race, religion, gender, age and ancestry.

The inclusion of the new category, which hasn't been previously reported, goes beyond U.S. discrimination laws, which do not explicitly ban casteism.

The update came after the tech sector - which counts India as its top source of skilled foreign workers - received a wake-up call in June 2020 when California's employment regulator sued Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) on behalf of a low-caste engineer who accused two higher-caste bosses of blocking his career.

Cisco, which denies wrongdoing, says an internal probe found no evidence of discrimination and that some of the allegations are baseless because caste is not a legally ""protected class"" in California. This month an appeals panel rejected the networking company's bid to push the case to private arbitration, meaning a public court case could come as early as next year. read more

The dispute - the first U.S. employment lawsuit about alleged casteism - has forced Big Tech to confront a millennia-old hierarchy where Indians' social position has been based on family lineage, from the top Brahmin ""priestly"" class to the Dalits, shunned as ""untouchables"" and consigned to menial labor.

Since the suit was filed, several activist and employee groups have begun seeking updated U.S. discrimination legislation - and have also called on tech companies to change their own policies to help fill the void and deter casteism.

Their efforts have produced patchy results, according to a Reuters review of policy across the U.S. industry, which employs hundreds of thousands of workers from India.

""I am not surprised that the policies would be inconsistent because that's almost what you would expect when the law is not clear,"" said Kevin Brown, a University of South Carolina law professor studying caste issues, citing uncertainty among executives over whether caste would ultimately make it into U.S. statutes.

""I could imagine that parts of ... (an) organization are saying this makes sense, and other parts are saying we don't think taking a stance makes sense.""

Apple's main internal policy on workplace conduct, which was seen by Reuters, added reference to caste in the equal employment opportunity and anti-harassment sections after September 2020.

Apple confirmed that it ""updated language a couple of years ago to reinforce that we prohibit discrimination or harassment based on caste."" It added that training provided to staff also explicitly mentions caste.

""Our teams assess our policies, training, processes and resources on an ongoing basis to ensure that they are comprehensive,"" it said. ""We have a diverse and global team, and are proud that our policies and actions reflect that.""

Elsewhere in tech, IBM told Reuters that it added caste, which was already in India-specific policies, to its global discrimination rules after the Cisco lawsuit was filed, though it declined to give a specific date or a rationale.

IBM's only training that mentions caste is for managers in India, the company added.

Several companies do not specifically reference caste in their main global policy, including Amazon (AMZN.O), Dell (DELL.N), Facebook owner Meta (META.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google (GOOGL.O). Reuters reviewed each of the policies, some of which are only published internally to employees.

The companies all told Reuters that they have zero tolerance for caste prejudice and, apart from Meta which did not elaborate, said such bias would fall under existing bans on discrimination by categories such as ancestry and national origin.

CASTEISM OUTLAWED IN INDIA

Caste discrimination was outlawed in India over 70 years ago, yet bias persists, according to several studies in recent years, including one that found Dalit people were underrepresented in higher-paying jobs. Debate over the hierarchy is contentious in India and abroad, with the issue intertwined with religion, and some people saying discrimination is now rare.

Government policies reserving seats for lower-caste students at top Indian universities have helped many land tech jobs in the West in recent years.

Reuters spoke to about two dozen Dalit tech workers in the United States who said discrimination had followed them overseas. They said that caste cues, including their last names, hometowns, diets or religious practices, had led to colleagues bypassing them in hiring, promotions and social activities.

Reuters could not independently verify the allegations of the workers, who all spoke on condition of anonymity, saying they feared harming their careers. Two said they had quit their jobs over what they viewed as casteism.

Some staff groups, including the Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) at Google's parent company, say explicit mention of caste in corporate rules would open the door to companies investing in areas such as data collection and training at the same levels as they do to protect other groups.

""Significant caste discrimination exists in the United States,"" said Mayuri Raja, a Google software engineer who is a member of the AWU and advocates for lower-caste colleagues.

Over 1,600 Google workers demanded the addition of caste to the main workplace code of conduct worldwide in a petition, seen by Reuters, which they emailed to CEO Sundar Pichai last month and resent last week after no response.

Google reiterated to Reuters that caste discrimination fell under national origin, ancestry and ethnic discrimination. It declined to elaborate further on its policies.

'NOT GOOD FOR BUSINESS'

Adding caste to a general code of conduct is not unheard of.

The World Wide Web Consortium, an industry standards body partly based in Massachusetts, introduced it in July 2020. California State University and the state Democratic Party have followed over the past two years.

In May this year, California's employment regulator, the Civil Rights Department, added caste to its example equal employment opportunity policy for employers.

Yet the move by Apple, a $2.8 trillion behemoth with more than 165,000 full-time employees globally, looms large.

The iPhone maker's fair hiring policy now states that Apple ""does not discriminate in recruiting, training, hiring, or promoting on the basis of"" 18 categories, including ""race, color, ancestry, national origin, caste, religion, creed, age"" plus disability, sexual orientation and gender identity.

By contrast, many employers are hesitant to go beyond laws with their primary policies, according to three employment attorneys including Koray Bulut, a partner at Goodwin Procter.

""Most companies simply quote from the federal and state statutes that list the protected categories,"" Bulut said.

Some companies have, however, gone further in secondary policies that govern limited operations or serve only as loose guidelines.

Caste is explicitly written into Dell's Global Social Media Policy, for example, and in Amazon sustainability team's Global Human Rights Principles and Google's code of conduct for suppliers.

Amazon and Dell confirmed they had also begun mentioning caste in anti-bias presentations for at least some new hires outside India. They declined to specify when, why and how broadly they made the addition, though Dell said it made the change after the Cisco lawsuit was filed.

The companies' presentations include explanations of caste as an unwanted social structure that exists in parts of the world, according to a Reuters review of some of the online training, with the Dell material referencing a recent lawsuit ""from the headlines.""

John-Paul Singh Deol, lead employment attorney at Dhillon Law Group in San Francisco, said that only including caste in training and guidelines amounted to ""giving lip service"" to the issue because their legal force is questionable.

This characterization was rejected by Janine Yancey, CEO of Emtrain, which sells anti-bias training to about 550 employers, and a longtime employment attorney.

""No company wants to have employee turnover, lack of productivity and conflict - that's just not good for business,"" she said.

Yet explicitly referencing caste would likely invite an increased number of HR complaints alleging it as a bias, Yancey added.

""Whenever you're going to call out something specifically, you're exponentially increasing your caseload,"" she said.

Apple declined to say whether any complaints had been brought under its caste provision.

South Carolina law professor Brown expects no immediate resolution to the debate over of whether companies should reference caste.

""This is an issue that ultimately will be resolved by the courts,"" he said. ""The area right now is unsettled.""

347,482,APPLE,2022-08-15,"Two Sigma, Soros among hedge funds positioned for tech comeback","













NEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Two Sigma Investments, Hudson Bay Capital Management, and Soros Fund Management were among the prominent hedge funds that added stakes in mega-cap technology companies in the last quarter, positioning themselves to potentially benefit from the recent comeback in growth stocks.

Two Sigma Investments, for instance, added a new position in Facebook-parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) of slightly more than 1.5 million shares that was worth $248.5 million at the end of June, according to securities filings.

Hudson Bay Capital added a new position of 4.66 million shares in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) worth nearly $638 million at the end of June, while Soros Fund Management added a new position of nearly 30,000 shares in Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) worth $20.1 million at the time of the filing.

Meta Platform's shares are up 12.1% so far this quarter, Apple has gained 26.6% and Tesla's shares have increased 37.8%.

Quarterly filings known as 13-fs are one of the few ways that hedge funds are required to disclose their long positions, but may not reflect current holdings.

Tech and growth stocks have come screaming back in recent weeks after a brutal first half of the year, as some investors bet the Federal Reserve will be less hawkish than previously anticipated in its fight to tame the worst inflation in forty years.

The Russell 1000 Growth Index (.RLG), which is dominated by tech stocks, is up 17.6% for the current quarter, compared with the 10.5% gain in the Russell 1000 Value index (.RLV).

The tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 19%.

Besides mega-cap tech companies, funds also added new positions in smaller growth and tech companies.

Soros, for instance, added 300,000 shares in Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N) that were worth $6.1 million at the end of the quarter, while Two Sigma bought 10.6 million shares of Snap Inc (SNAP.N) worth approximately $140 million at the end of June.

Shares of Snap are down 6.7% for the quarter to date, while shares of Uber are up nearly 59% over the same time.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid















Aug 15 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), run by billionaire Warren Buffett, has tripled its stake in online banking company Ally Financial Inc (ALLY.N) and increased its bet that ""Call of Duty"" video game maker Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) will be acquired by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

In a Monday regulatory filing describing its U.S.-listed equity investments as of June 30, Berkshire also said it exited what was once an $8.3 billion investment in Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and no longer owns Royalty Pharma Plc (RPRX.O), which buys drug royalties.

The filing does not specify whether Buffett or his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler made specific purchases and sales, but investors often try to mimic what Berkshire does. Larger investments are normally Buffett's.

Berkshire slowed its stock buying spree in the second quarter as U.S. stock markets fell, purchasing $6.2 billion of stocks and selling $2.3 billion. It had bought $51.1 billion and sold $9.7 billion in the first quarter.

Nevertheless, Buffett's conglomerate, which also owns dozens of businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Geico auto insurer, ended June with a $327.7 billion equity portfolio, led by $125.1 billion in Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

It also invested more than $33 billion in two oil companies, Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N), as oil prices surged following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Berkshire has since purchased another $1.7 billion of Occidental stock, boosting its stake to 20.2%. read more It also owns $10 billion of Occidental preferred stock.

In the second quarter, Berkshire's Ally stake grew to 30 million shares from about 9 million, while its Activision stake grew to 68.4 million shares, worth $5.3 billion, from 64.3 million.

The Activision investment is a form of arbitrage, where Buffett appears to be betting that investors are pessimistic that regulators will approve Microsoft's proposed $68.7 billion takeover of the company.

According to Monday's filing, Berkshire also increased its holdings during the second quarter in Apple, Celanese Corp (CE.N), Chevron, Markel Corp (MKL.N), McKesson Corp (MCK.N), Occidental and Paramount Global (PARA.O).

It reduced its holdings in General Motors Co (GM.N), Kroger Co (KR.N), Store Capital Corp (STOR.N) and US Bancorp (USB.N), the filing shows.

349,320,APPLE,2022-08-15,Apple's $30 mln settlement over employee bag checks gets court approval,"













Aug 15 (Reuters) - A federal judge in California has signed off on Apple Inc.'s (AAPL.O) $30.5 million settlement in a nearly decade-old lawsuit claiming the company shortchanged 15,000 retail workers by not paying them for time spent in security checks after their shifts.

U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco approved the settlement in the 2013 class action on Saturday. The California Supreme Court in 2020 used the case to rule that state law requires employees to be paid when they go through mandatory security screenings.

Walmart Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are also among major U.S. employers to face similar lawsuits. Amazon and a staffing agency last year agreed to pay $8.7 million to 42,000 warehouse workers to settle one of those cases.

The plaintiffs in Apple's case claimed retail workers often waited several minutes after clocking out, and sometimes longer, to have their bags checked before they could leave the stores where they worked.

Apple and lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Alsup had dismissed the case in 2015, saying the workers were not under the company's control during security checks because they were not required to bring personal items to work that would have to be screened.

A federal appeals court asked the California Supreme Court to decide whether time spent in post-shift screenings had to be compensated under state law.

The state court in 2020 ruled against Apple, saying it was impractical to expect employees not to bring personal belongings to work. The federal court then revived the case and Alsup last year said he planned to grant summary judgment to the plaintiffs and order a trial on damages.

The case is Frlekin et al v. Apple Inc, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 3:13-cv-03451.

SHANGHAI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Apple supplier BOE Technology Group Co Ltd (000725.SZ) will ""make adjustments"" at its operations in Sichuan due to power rationing in the region, it said in a stock market filing on Tuesday.

The company said that it was communicating with authorities and expected ""no major impact on its overall operating performance"".

It added that it has four production lines making displays for hardware devices in the region - two lines producing LCD screens, and two producing AMOLED screens.

The company supplies small volumes of displays to Apple for its iPhone 13 devices and older models, and could potentially supply displays for the upcoming iPhone 14, according to reports from Ming-Chi Kuo, an Apple analyst at research firm TF Securities.

Apple did not respond to a request for comment.

A record-setting heatwave in Sichuan province has led authorities to implement power rationing in several cities, which has subsequently caused a number of companies to cut production.

CATL, the world's largest battery maker, will stop production at its plants in the city of Yibin from Aug. 15-20 due to the power cuts, local news outlet Jiemian reported on Tuesday. CATL did not respond to a request for comment.

Also on Tuesday, Japanese media outlet Kyodo reported that Toyota (7203.T) had suspended production at its plant in Sichuan.

Chemical producer Sichuan Xinjinlu and mining company Sichuan Hongda Co Ltd (600331.SS) also announced certain units in the region would suspend production.

On Monday, Apple supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (2317.TW) declined to confirm the status of its operations in Sichuan but a spokesperson said the impact of the power crunch was ""not big"".

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) suppliers are in talks to produce Apple Watch and MacBook in Vietnam for the first time, Nikkei Asia reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Apple's Chinese supplier Luxshare Precision Industry (002475.SZ) and Taiwan-based Foxconn (2317.TW) have started test production of Apple Watch in northern Vietnam, the report added.

Apple has asked suppliers to set up a test production line in Vietnam for the MacBook, the report said, adding that progress in moving mass production to the country has been slow partly due to pandemic-related disruptions but also because notebook computer production involves a larger supply chain.

Apple has been shifting some areas of iPhone production from China to other markets, including India, where it started manufacturing iPhone 13 earlier this year, and is also planning to assemble iPad tablets. read more

India, the world's second-biggest smartphone market, along with countries such as Mexico and Vietnam, is becoming increasingly important to contract manufacturers supplying American brands, as they try to diversify production away from China.

Apple, Foxconn and Luxshare Precision did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Last week, Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn gave a cautious outlook for the current quarter after posting results that exceeded expectations, citing slowing smartphone demand after a pandemic-fuelled boom. read more

Like other global manufacturers, Foxconn - formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd - has dealt with a severe shortage of chips that hurt production, as bottlenecks from the pandemic lingered and the Ukraine war further strained logistical channels.

354,842,APPLE,2022-08-18,New TV series 'Bad Sisters' tells dark tale through comedy,"













LONDON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Actor, comedian and filmmaker Sharon Horgan says her new dark comedy thriller ""Bad Sisters"" is a celebration of family ties.

Set in Ireland, the 10-episode series centres around the Garvey sisters, a tight-knit fivesome who lost their parents at a young age.

When the husband of one of the sisters suddenly dies, insurers set their sights on the five, discovering that each of them had reason to want to kill the unkind and coercive John Paul, played by Claes Bang.

The series was adapted from the Belgian TV show ""Clan"" by Horgan, who also stars as one of the sisters alongside Anne-Marie Duff, Eva Birthistle, Sarah Greene and Eve Hewson.

""It's about four sisters who try and rescue their fifth sister from a monstrous relationship. A lot of funny happens off the back of that but really it's about love and family,"" Horgan, herself one of five siblings, told Reuters on the eve of the show's debut.

Brian Gleeson and Daryl McCormack play the insurance agents and half-brothers Thomas and Matt Claffin who have their own motives to dig deeper into John Paul's death.

Actor Sharon Horgan arrives for a special presentation of ""Military Wives"" at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada September 6, 2019. REUTERS/Mark Blinch

The series opens with John Paul's funeral and shifts back in time to reveal his controlling behaviour in the lead up to his death.

Starting out as banter between the sisters, their plans to rid of John Paul gain momentum as the show advances.

""Even if it is funny, it is about a very abusive relationship. So, I hope there's something perhaps in there that can actually say something and resonate with people in a way that could mean something to them,"" said Bang.

Duff, who plays his wife, Grace, said there was a great sense of responsibility in playing the role.

""I had to invest it with as much integrity as if I were doing a serious drama, because there could be people watching the show, men and women, who are in maybe bullying circumstances for whom it's very powerful and helps them recognise things,"" she said.

""Bad Sisters"" starts streaming on Apple TV+ on Friday.

BEIJING, Aug 19 (Reuters) - ByteDance's Douyin and Alibaba-owned (9988.HK) Ele.me said on Friday they have agreed on a collaboration that will see the food delivery app establish a presence on Douyin, as the Chinese short video app builds its ecosystem.

Ele.me would be one of the biggest players to date that Douyin, the Chinese equivalent of TikTok, has brought into its mini-programme platform that it launched some two years ago.

""Douyin's open platform is an important bridge that Douyin uses to connect users with business partners,"" Douyin chief executive Kelly Zhang Nan said in a joint statement.

Chinese ""super-apps"", including Tencent Holding's (0700.HK) WeChat and Ant Group's Alipay, have made forays into the mini-programme field as they aim to create their own ecosystems to keep users engaged.

WeChat, China's ubiquitous messaging app, said its average daily active users for mini programmes hit 450 million in 2021. In general, mini programmes look and operate much like apps on Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iOS and Google's (GOOGL.O) Android operating systems but they are less data intensive.

Douyin counts more than 600 million daily active users.

A person familiar with the matter said that Douyin's mini programmes were different to those of other players as they were mainly powered by the app's recommendation algorithm, meaning that users would be recommended services based on their use of the app.

Ele.me is China's second largest food delivery platform after Meituan (3690.HK).

Douyin last year started allowing its users to place takeout orders directly via livestreams. The deliveries are handled by restaurants or delivery riders hired by another service.

Douyin does not employ delivery riders.

357,618,APPLE,2022-08-19,Taiwan July export order growth seen slowing on cooling demand,"Summary

Summary Companies For poll data click:

Orders median forecast +3.6% y/y (prior month +9.5%)

Data due Monday, Aug 22, 4:00 p.m. (0800 GMT)















TAIPEI, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Taiwan's export orders likely grew for a third consecutive month in July, but at less than half the pace of the previous month as global demand cools, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.

The median forecast from a poll of 11 economists was for export orders to rise 3.6% from a year earlier. Forecasts ranged for an expansion of between 1.1% and 7.5%.

The island's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, unexpectedly fell for the first time in two years in April. Orders shrank 5.5% from a year earlier to $51.9 billion, taking a larger-than-expected hit from COVID-19 lockdowns in China and broader global supply chain disruptions.

But they returned to growth in May and June. In June orders went up 9.5% from a year earlier to $58.83 billion.

The government has predicted July orders to be between 0.4% and 3.1% higher than the year before.

Taiwan's export orders are a leading indicator of demand for hi-tech gadgets and Asian exports, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months.

The island's manufacturers, including the world's largest contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW), are a key part of the global supply chain for technology giants including Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

The data for July will be released on Monday.

Aug 22 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) said on Monday it would offer customers tools and know-how to repair and service their MacBook laptops at home, months after launching the service for iPhones.

Apple said genuine parts and service tools will be available starting Aug. 23. Customers can buy the repair kits or rent it for one-time use for $49.

Self repairs are possible only on MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models with the M1 chips.

In April, Apple launched self-repair services for select iPhones models in the United States, with plans to expand the service to Europe this year.

The development comes close on the heels of Apple agreeing to pay $50 million to settle a class-action lawsuit related to ""butterfly"" keyboards on some models of MacBook laptop. (https://reut.rs/3QW7a6e)

Aug 23 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) plans to start making the iPhone 14 in India about two months after its release out of China, in a move that will narrow the gap from the typical six to nine months for previous launches, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.

The company has been working with suppliers to ramp up manufacturing in India and the first iPhone 14s from the country are likely to be finished in late October or November, following the initial September release, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.(https://bloom.bg/3PKqMcB)

Apple's Taiwan-based supplier Foxconn (2317.TW) has studied the process of shipping items from China and assembling the iPhone 14 at its plant outside southern Indian city of Chennai, it reported.

The U.S. tech giant is looking at options after Beijing's clashes with Washington and lockdowns across the country disrupted production, according to the report.

Apple did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.

Aug 23 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) launched Google Wallet in South Africa on Tuesday, as the tech giant tries to gain a foothold in the country's rapidly growing digital payments space.

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift to digital transactions and people increasingly prefer making contactless payments via their smart devices. High smartphone penetration has also helped adoption rates.

The Google Wallet app stores a consumer's credit or debit card information and allows shoppers to pay for goods by tapping their phone against a retail store's point of sale at the checkout counter.

From Tuesday, cardholders of FirstRand Bank (FSRJ.J), Discovery Bank, Investec (INLJ.J), Standard Bank (SBKJ.J), ABSA (ABGJ.J) and Nedbank (NEDJ.J) will be able to add their cards to Google Wallet, Google said.

They will then be able to pay with their Android phones or use OS devices where contactless payments are accepted.

Last year, rival Apple Inc (AAPL.O) launched its Apple Pay mobile payment system in South Africa.

Xpeng Inc Follow















Aug 22 (Reuters) - A former Apple Inc (AAPL.O) engineer on Monday pleaded guilty to trade secret theft - one of two people accused of stealing trade secrets from the iPhone maker's nascent self-driving car program.

U.S. federal prosecutors have alleged that Xiaolang Zhang downloaded the plan for a circuit board for Apple's self-driving after disclosing his intentions to work for a Chinese self-driving car startup and booking a last-minute flight to China.

He was arrested at the San Jose airport after he passed through a security checkpoint.

Xpeng, the Chinese electric car maker Zhang joined after leaving Apple in 2018, said on its Twitter-like Sina Weibo account on Tuesday that the company had no dispute with Apple over the issue and that it was not involved in Zhang's case in any form.

Zhang initially pleaded not guilty to the charges but according to court documents on Monday, he had reached a plea deal with prosecutors and changed his plea to guilty. The plea deal is sealed and sentencing is set for November.

Zhang's attorney confirmed the plea agreement but declined to comment further. Apple and the U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Jizhong Chen, the other former Apple engineer charged with trade secret theft, has pleaded not guilty. He has a court hearing set for Aug. 29.

362,789,APPLE,2022-08-23,Truth Social to join Rumble's advertising platform,"













Aug 23 (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Donald Trump's social media platform, Truth Social, will join the video-sharing company Rumble's new ad platform as its first publisher, the companies said on Tuesday, as the Trump venture seeks to sell ads while circumventing Big Tech firms like Google.

The announcement reflects a deepening relationship between Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), Truth Social's parent company, and Rumble, a Canadian video-sharing platform that caters to conservatives.

Both Rumble and TMTG are positioning themselves as alternatives to Big Tech firms; in the announcement of its new ad platform, Rumble described it as competition to Google's AdSense and Ad Exchange advertising programs.

The two sides had already struck a ""technology and cloud services” deal in December that would include video and streaming for Truth Social.

Rumble had also already been working with TMTG for months in a role that was described internally as a key strategic partnership but not clearly defined to staffers, according to two people with knowledge of TMTG operations.

Truth Social restored Trump's social media presence more than a year after he was banned from Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), Facebook and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) YouTube following the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riots, after he was accused of posting messages inciting violence.

The platform launched in the Apple App Store on Feb. 21 and has yet to become available in the Google Play Store for Android users.

Advertising is key to TMTG's business. In a May 27 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Digital World Acquisition Corp , the blank-check firm taking TMTG public, said that TMTG ""may rely on the sale of advertising services for the substantial majority of TMTG’s revenue.""

As of Aug. 23 Trump had 3.89 million followers on Truth Social, compared to the more than 88 million he had on Twitter when he was banned.

363,760,APPLE,2022-08-24,Visa tokens overtake payments giant's physical cards in circulation,"













Aug 24 (Reuters) - Payments giant Visa Inc (V.N) said on Wednesday it has issued over 4 billion network tokens worldwide through its security technology Visa Token Service (VTS), outpacing the total number of its physical cards in circulation.

VTS replaces 16-digit Visa account numbers with a token that only Visa can unlock, protecting the underlying account information.

""Without exposing the consumer's account to fraud, tokenization enables frictionless, card-free payments,"" Jack Forestell, executive vice president and chief product officer at Visa, told Reuters.

The popularity of the service driven by its promise of safer online transactions corresponds with the surge in online spending since the global outbreak of COVID-19.

E-commerce volume has grown by more than 50% since the onset of the pandemic, the world's largest payments processor said in a statement citing data from the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Since launching VTS in 2014, Visa said it had issued 1 billion tokens by 2020, after which growth accelerated to 2 billion in 2021 before doubling this year.

The demand is not likely to ebb, with most consumers retaining the lockdown habit of swiping cards online and helped by ongoing investments from companies in making shopping on digital platforms more secure and user friendly.

""E-commerce is now happening everywhere. Online happens in-store as merchants look to provide more options for consumers. In-store, your phone can also be your Visa card,"" Forestell added.

VTS, compatible with popular apps such as Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google Pay and Apple Pay , runs as a payments security platform offering different solutions for retail consumers as well as institutions like banks and clearing houses.

Late in July, Visa reported quarterly profit that sailed past Wall Street estimates on the back of resilient consumer spending that has so far been undeterred by red-hot inflation as well as a summer travel boom across much of the U.S. read more

Summary Law firms

Law firms Related documents Washington is 11th state to settle similar claims

Company accused of failing to pass drug discounts on to Medicaid















(Reuters) - Managed care giant Centene Corp has agreed to pay $33.3 million to resolve claims that it overcharged Apple Health, Washington state's Medicaid program, for pharmacy benefit management services, the latest in a string of similar settlements with states.

Under the deal announced Wednesday, the state will receive $19 million and the federal government will receive $13.3 million to be used in its administration of Apple Health, according to the office of Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson. A whistleblower who sued the company on behalf of the state will receive $1 million.

It is the second-largest Medicaid fraud settlement in the state's history, after a $47 million settlement with Wyeth Pharmaceuticals in 2016, according Ferguson's office.

""Medicaid dollars are a precious resource meant to fund care for the most vulnerable among us,"" Ferguson said in a statement. ""My office works to ensure that these dollars go where they are intended — not toward fraud.""

""This no-fault agreement reflects the significance we place on addressing their concerns and our ongoing commitment to making the delivery of healthcare local, simple and transparent,"" Centene said in a statement.

Ferguson's office said that Centene, which provides pharmacy benefit management services through its Envolve subsidiary, failed to pass discounts it received from drugmakers on to the Medicaid program.

The company previously settled similar claims with 10 other states, including New Hampshire, Ohio and Mississippi, for a total of more than $260 million. While denying any wrongdoing, it said last year that it was in negotiations with more states and had set aside $1.25 billion to settle related claims.

The case is Washington ex rel Hurst v. Centene Corp, Thurston County Superior Court, No. 22-2-01860-34.

365,109,APPLE,2022-08-24,"Apple sends invites for Sept 7 event, analysts expect new iPhones","













Aug 24 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Wednesday sent media invitations to a Sept. 7 event when analysts expect the company to unveil new iPhones, a week earlier than its traditional autumn event.

If Apple follows its pattern of shipping devices about a week and a half after it unveils them, it could add two weeks of iPhone sales to the company's fiscal fourth quarter.

Analysts expect Apple to introduce a new generation iPhone 14 model.

Reuters has previously reported that Apple told suppliers it expects the new generation of phones to sell better than its predecessors did.

Apple is also expected soon to unveil new models of the Apple Watch, iPad and Mac computers, some perhaps at the September event.

While the company has largely insulated the iPhone from supply chain turbulence, it warned in an earnings call last month that parts shortages could hamper sales of some of those other products.

Apple plans to host the event at the Steve Jobs Theater at its headquarters in Cupertino, California.

The event would be the first in-person, indoor event since the coronavirus pandemic began in 2020.

Apple earlier this year held an event for developers, but the keynote presentation was given outdoors at its headquarters.

The invitation's artwork features the Apple logo surrounded by an outline of night-sky stars and the caption ""far out.""

Summary

Summary Companies Match legal challenge latest headache for Apple in India

Tinder owner argues Apple competition in market-filing

Apple has earlier claimed it is a tiny player in India

Match case has been clubbed with ongoing Apple probes-sources















NEW DELHI, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Tinder-owner Match Group (MTCH.O) has filed an antitrust case against Apple (AAPL.O) with the competition regulator in India, accusing it of ""monopolistic conduct"" that forces developers to pay high commissions for in-app purchases, a legal filing seen by Reuters shows.

Apple is fending off a raft of antitrust challenges around the globe and Match's July filing adds to two other cases in India though Match is the first foreign company to mount such a challenge against the iPhone maker in the country. read more

Apple and the Competition Commission of India (CCI) did not respond to Reuters queries, while a Match spokesperson declined to comment on its filing.

In the previously unreported India filing, Match argues Apple's conduct restricts innovation and development of app developers that offer digital services by enforcing the use of its proprietary in-app purchase system and ""excessive"" 30% commission.

A similar dispute in the Netherlands resulted in a 50 million euro fine for Apple and an agreement to allow different payment methods in Dutch dating applications. read more

The U.S. giant has long mandated use of its in-app payment system, which charges commissions that some developers like Match have argued globally are too high.

Match argues in its India filing that users in other countries often prefer to use payment methods which Apple does not permit, and in India a state-backed online transfer system was preferred.

""Apple is therefore leveraging its dominant position in the iOS App Store market, to promote the exclusive use of its own payment solution,"" Mark Buse, head of global government relations for Match, said in the filing.

In India, the CCI in December started investigating allegations from a local non-profit group that alleged Apple's in-app purchase system hurts competition by raising costs for app developers and customers, while also acting as a barrier to market entry. read more

The watchdog ordered the probe after Apple denied any wrongdoing, saying it was not the dominant player in India where it has an ""insignificant"" 0-5% market share, arguing it was Google's Android that commanded a 90-100% share. read more

The investigation will now cover each of the three separate cases that have been filed against Apple, according to three sources with knowledge of the proceedings.

Match's Tinder is one of India's most popular dating apps, and accounted for about 51% of consumer spending in the top five dating apps during the second quarter of this year, data from Sensor Tower shows.

In recent years, Apple has loosened some restrictions for developers globally, like allowing them to use communications - such as email - to share information about payment alternatives outside of their iOS app and lowering commissions for smaller developers to 15%.

""Such commission rate does not apply to the apps of Match's portfolio brands,"" Match's filing stated.

Apple says in India, 87% of apps on its App Store are those which don't pay any commissions at all.

Match has also complained that Apple considers ride-hailing apps in India such as Uber and SoftBank-backed Ola as those providing ""physical goods/services"", allowing them to provide alternate payment solutions, even though they perform ""a similar matchmaking function"" like a dating app.

""Both dating and ridesharing apps share the same fundamental purpose i.e. matching two people online to meet in the real world ... Apple has arbitrarily declared that the two are different,"" Match said.

367,808,APPLE,2022-08-25,Dell fans slowdown fears with weak revenue forecast,"













Aug 25 (Reuters) - Dell Technologies Inc (DELL.N) joined rivals in predicting a slowdown as runaway inflation and the darkening economic outlook prompt consumers and businesses to tighten their purse strings, sending its shares down 8% in extended trading on Thursday.

Industry majors from Intel Corp to Lenovo Group (0992.HK) have warned of a slump in the personal computer market after a two-year boom during the pandemic, with research firm Gartner estimating shipments would drop 9.5% in 2022.

While Dell's enterprise-focused business has somewhat made up for the PC slowdown, company executives were cautious about the outlook for the unit that generates nearly half its revenue.

""There's caution around future hiring, trade-offs within their IT budgets given the macroeconomic uncertainty, customers reducing the size of orders and buying for only immediate requirements,"" co-Chief Operating Officer Chuck Whitten said on a post-earnings call.

The company expects third-quarter revenue between $23.8 billion and $25 billion, below the $26.34 billion estimated by analysts, according to Refinitiv data.

Revenue growth in the second quarter was the slowest in more than one and a half years as the company also took a hit from a surge in the dollar and COVID-19 flare-ups in China - its second-largest market.

The stronger dollar has pressured earnings of technology companies from Microsoft Inc (MSFT.O) to Apple Inc (AAPL.O), and will likely continue to be a headache as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.

Consumer revenue declined 9%, but was somewhat offset by a 15% jump in the commercial business that benefited from businesses placing orders to gear up the hybrid-work era.

Infrastructure solutions group, home to the company's storage business, grew 12% to $9.5 billion.

Dell reported an adjusted profit of $1.68 per share on revenue of $26.43 billion, which was 9% higher.

The social media firm said on Thursday the feature would be available to a random group of users who can listen to full shows through curated playlists based on their interests, initially only in English. (https://bit.ly/3Agti4s)

Podcasts will be integrated into Twitter Spaces, which launched in 2020 after the success of social audio chat app Clubhouse during the pandemic.

Podcasts boomed in the past two years when people stuck indoors because of COVID-19 curbs turned to them for content ranging from breaking news to true-crime documentaries.

Wall Street is also optimistic about the long-term potential of the format as podcasts engage listeners for hours, creating valuable advertising opportunities.

370,658,APPLE,2022-08-25,Cannabis fintech Bespoke to expand BNPL base in cash-starved industry,"













Aug 25 (Reuters) - Fintech firm Bespoke Financial is looking to expand its 'buy now pay later' service for cannabis businesses in California and Massachusetts later this year, its Chief Executive George Mancheril said on Thursday.

The push comes after a successful pilot launch in July that allowed cannabis retail outlets to buy products from producers using the service that allows them to pay back after its sale.

The service that uses partner point-of-sales firm Blaze's software is coming to the weed sector struggling to get funds from banks as it is classified as illegal under federal rules.

Amid slow banking and legal reforms, the sector is going through a downturn, with marijuana stocks losing nearly 80% of their value from their high in February last year.

""Cannabis has always been its own microcosm, where because of federal illegality we have less access to capital relative to other industries,"" Mancheril said in an interview with Reuters.

The plan by Bespoke and Blaze also comes at a stormy time for other BNPL firms as their valuations take a hit from spiraling inflation that has slowed consumer spending.

The two fintech firms believe their service can sidestep such worries as they tap into larger fees from companies, especially the niche cannabis industry, rather than consumers.

""With B2B, there's a way to actually underwrite risk and to measure risk, in a way that's much more difficult than on the consumer level,"" Mancheril said.

The sector's financing hurdles is a boon for Bespoke as there is no competition from larger BNPL firms, said Karan Wadhera, managing partner at Casa Verde Capital, a venture capital firm that funds cannabis startups including Bespoke.

""We're not seeing Affirm or Klarna, and definitely not Apple come into our space anytime soon.""

372,224,APPLE,2022-08-26,U.S. Justice Department in early stages of drafting possible antitrust suit against Apple -Politico,"Companies Apple Inc Follow















WASHINGTON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is in the early stages of drafting a potential antitrust complaint against Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Politico reported on Friday, citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter.

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Politico reported the Justice Department has not made a decision whether to sue Apple, but the department’s antitrust division hopes to file suit by the end of the year.

Reuters reported previously that the Justice Department opened an antitrust probe into Apple in 2019.

373,431,APPLE,2022-08-29,EXCLUSIVE Win for Qualcomm as no EU appeal court ruling against $991 mln fine - sources,"













BRUSSELS, Aug 29 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators will not appeal a court ruling scrapping its 997-million-euro ($991 million) fine against Qualcomm (QCOM.O), people familiar with the matter said, in a major win for the U.S. chipmaker that ends a long-running saga.

The Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second-highest, in its June judgment was scathing of the European Commission's handling of the case, saying procedural irregularities had affected Qualcomm's rights of defence. read more

Judges also invalidated the Commission's analysis that payments made by Qualcomm to Apple (AAPL.O) were anti-competitive because the regulator had not taken into account all the relevant facts.

It would be very difficult for the EU competition watchdog to win on both counts in an appeal, the people familiar with the matter said.

The judgment was a major setback for EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, who has handed out billion-euro fines to Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google and opened investigations into Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple and Facebook owner Meta (META.O) as part of her crackdown on Big Tech.

The European Commission, which can appeal to the EU Court of Justice (CJEU) on points of law, declined to comment. Qualcomm found itself in the EU's crosshairs in 2015.

The Commission's decision not to contest the Court finding was not surprising, said Peter Alexiadis, visiting professor at King's College in London.

""Even if the Commission were to succeed on the substantive grounds of appeal, such a victory would be nothing more than Pyrrhic, given the fact that the Commission decision would nevertheless inevitably be annulled on the procedural grounds, where the Commission's case seems to be weak,"" he said.

An appeal might, however, force the court to clarify which exclusivity relationships held by dominant firms were problematic, Alexiadis said.

""It is nevertheless disappointing that the antitrust Bar does not have a chance to benefit from a CJEU ruling on the question of economic incentives to pursue exclusivity strategies,"" he said.

The EU competition enforcer, in its 2018 decision, said Qualcomm paid billions of dollars to Apple from 2011 to 2016 to use only its chips in all its iPhones and iPads in order to block out rivals such as Intel Corp (INTC.O).

Vestager faces her next test on Sept. 14, when the General Court will rule on Google's challenge against a record 4.34-billion-euro antitrust fine imposed for using its Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals.

374,451,APPLE,2022-08-30,Truth Social Android app not approved on Google Play Store,"













Aug 30 (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Donald Trump's social media platform Truth Social has not yet been approved for distribution on Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google Play Store due to insufficient content moderation, according to a Google spokesperson on Tuesday.

The delay marks a setback for the app, which launched in the Apple App Store on Feb. 21. Android phones comprise about 40% of the U.S. smartphone market. Without the Google and Apple stores, there is no easy way for most smartphone users to download Truth Social.

“On August 19, we notified Truth Social of several violations of standard policies in their current app submission and reiterated that having effective systems for moderating user-generated content is a condition of our terms of service for any app to go live on Google Play,” Google said in a statement.

Google said it has expressed concerns to Truth Social about violations of its Play Store policies prohibiting content like physical threats and incitement to violence.

Truth Social parent company Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) did not respond to Reuters' request for comment, but in a press release said that it has “continuously worked in good faith with Google to ensure that the Truth Social Android App complies with Google’s policies without compromising our promise to be a haven for free speech.”

It added: “Moreover, some of our competitors’ apps are allowed in the Google Play Store despite rampantly violating Google’s prohibition on sexual content and other policies, whereas Truth Social has zero tolerance for sexually explicit content.”

News of the Android delay was first reported by Axios.

Truth Social restored Trump's presence on social media more than a year after he was banned from Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), Facebook (META.O) and Alphabet Inc's YouTube following the Jan. 6, 2021 U.S. Capitol riots, after he was accused of posting messages inciting violence.

TMTG has pledged to deliver an “engaging and censorship-free experience” on Truth Social, appealing to a base that feels its views around such hot-button topics such as the outcome of the 2020 presidential election have been scrubbed from mainstream tech platforms.

Aug 30 (Reuters) - Consumers stung by decades-high inflation are not shifting to cheaper smartphones, Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) said on Tuesday, boding well for Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) upcoming iPhones likely to be unveiled next week.

The comments from the largest U.S. consumer electronics retailer come at a time when the soaring prices of gas and groceries have prompted a cutback in non-essential spending.

Best Buy Chief Executive Officer Corie Barry said consumers were switching to cheaper alternatives in categories such as televisions, but demand for expensive smartphones was holding strong.

""There are other categories like mobile phones where it is not as much a decision between trading up or trading down. You want a certain brand and you want a certain type of phone,"" Barry said.

Analysts at J.P. Morgan last week raised concerns around the enthusiasm for the new iPhones, citing consumer expectations of a price hike and limited new features.

Best Buy also said on Tuesday that cost-conscious shoppers might delay holiday season shopping to the last minute this year in search of the best deals. read more

376,248,APPLE,2022-08-30,"Australia demands Apple, Meta, Microsoft share anti-abuse steps, threatens fines","













SYDNEY, Aug 30 (Reuters) - An Australian regulator sent legal letters to Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) demanding they share their strategies for stamping out child abuse material on their platforms or face fines.

The e-Safety Commissioner, a body set up to protect internet users, said it used laws which took effect in January to compel the technology giants to disclose measures they were taking to detect and remove abuse material within 28 days. If they did not, the companies would each face a fine of A$555,000 ($383,000) per day.

The threat underscores Australia's hardline approach to regulating Big Tech firms since 2021 which has so far included laws forcing them to pay media outlets for displaying their content and laws making them hand over details of anonymous accounts which post defamatory material.

The internet firms have meanwhile been under pressure around the world to find a way to monitor encrypted messaging and streaming services for child abuse material without encroaching on user privacy. read more

""This activity is no longer confined to hidden corners of the dark web but is prevalent on the mainstream platforms we and our children use every day,"" said commissioner Julie Inman Grant in a statement.

""As more companies move towards encrypted messaging services and deploy features like livestreaming, the fear is that this horrific material will spread unchecked on these platforms,"" she added.

A spokeperson for Microsoft, which owns video calling service Skype, said the company had received the letter and planned to respond within 28 days.

A spokesperson for Meta, which also owns messaging service WhatsApp, said the company was still reviewing the letter but continued to ""proactively engage with the eSafety Commissioner on these important issues"".

Apple, which owns video messaging service FaceTime, messaging service iMessage and photo storing service iCloud, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

The eSafety Commissioner referred to figures provided by the U.S. National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, which said this year it had received 29.1 million reports of child abuse material from internet companies, of which just 160 were from Apple while 22 million were from Facebook.

377,771,APPLE,2022-08-30,Hong Kong court upholds warrant on tycoon Jimmy Lai's phones,"













HONG KONG, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's High Court on Tuesday upheld a new warrant obtained by the national security police to search the contents of media tycoon Jimmy Lai's phones.

In one of the former British colony's biggest national security cases, Lai and six former Apple Daily staff members were charged with collusion with foreign forces under the new law imposed by Beijing in 2020.

Senior Council Philip Dykes, representing Lai, had challenged the warrant, saying that the phones contained journalistic material and that protecting it was essential for a free press. The lack of such safeguards causes a ""chilling effect"", he said.

In his ruling, Judge Wilson Chan said that press freedom in itself had ""never translated into an absolute ban against the search and seizure"" of journalistic materials.

Chan ruled Lai's phones can remain sealed until 11.00 pm on Sept. 6 as his lawyers will appeal against the decision.

Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with a promise of extensive autonomy and freedoms unavailable in mainland China.

Critics of the security law say it quashes individual rights, which authorities deny, saying the law restored stability after mass anti-government protests in 2019.

According to a notice by Lai's lawyers, police seized two smartphones during the arrest at his home in August 2020. ""A physical hack occurred"" without Lai's knowledge and consent before his lawyers arrived, it said.

The phones, which remain unlocked, were then plugged into a mobile charger before being sealed, it said.

The search warrant was issued by Principal Magistrate Peter Law who said the phones might ""contain evidence of an offence endangering national security"".

The trial will begin on Dec. 1, heard by Judges Esther Toh, Susana D'Almada Remedios and Alex Lee.

Secretary of Justice Paul Lam has ordered a no-jury trial, citing unspecified ""involvement of foreign factors,"" and risks to the jurors' personal safety and of ""perverting the course of justice.""

Lai has indicated he will plead not guilty. All other defenders have indicated guilty pleas.

378,122,APPLE,2022-08-31,"Apple, HTC cleared in U.S. trade tribunal dispute over wireless patents","













Aug 31 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday affirmed a win for Apple Inc (AAPL.O), HTC Corp (2498.TW)and ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) against allegations that imports of their devices infringe wireless-technology patents.

The companies' smartphones, smart watches, tablets and other LTE-capable devices do not violate INVT SPE LLC's rights in two patents originally owned by Panasonic, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said.

The companies and their attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

INVT is a patent-holding company affiliated with investment funds managed by Fortress Investment Group LLC, a SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) subsidiary.

Fortress defeated a separate lawsuit last year brought by Apple and Intel that accused it and its affiliates, including INVT, of violating antitrust law by stockpiling thousands of patents and demanding extortionate licensing fees. Apple later dropped out of the case, which is currently on appeal.

INVT filed a complaint against Apple, HTC and ZTE at the U.S. International Trade Commission in 2018, accusing their devices that comply with the LTE wireless standard of infringing its patents. It sought a ban on imports of the allegedly infringing devices.

The commission ruled for the device makers in 2020. A three-judge Federal Circuit panel upheld the decision Wednesday.

U.S. Circuit Judge Raymond Chen wrote the devices did not infringe one of INVT's patents because they functioned differently than what is described in the patent. The devices were not capable of receiving and handling data signals in the same way as INVT's patented technology, the appeals court said.

The Federal Circuit also found the patent was not essential to the LTE standard, and that the devices did not infringe simply by being LTE capable.

The court found the rest of the appeal was moot because INVT's other patent had expired. Apple and ZTE previously withdrew from this appeal.

Aug 30 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) Chief Privacy Officer Jane Horvath will be leaving the company soon to work at a law firm, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday citing people familiar with the matter.

Horvath, who joined Apple in 2011, is taking a job at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, the report said. (https://bloom.bg/3pVA6zI)

The iPhone maker's top privacy executive, who is also a lawyer, had previously served in key privacy roles at Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google the U.S. Department of Justice, as per her LinkedIn profile.

Horvath was hired to formalize privacy practices after the 2011 ""locationgate"" scandal, in which iPhones were found to be gathering information about users' whereabouts.

The reported move by Horvath also comes after Apple upended the digital ad industry by introducing new iPhone privacy controls last year, which hurt the ability for firms like Meta (META.O) and Snap (SNAP.N) to target and measure ads on their apps.

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.

380,460,APPLE,2022-08-31,"Arm sues Qualcomm, aiming to unwind Qualcomm's $1.4 bln Nuvia purchase","













SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Chip technology firm Arm Ltd, which is owned by Softbank Group Corp (9984.T), on Wednesday said it had sued Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and Qualcomm's recently acquired chip design firm Nuvia Inc for breach of license agreements and trademark infringement.

Arm is seeking an injunction that would require Qualcomm to destroy designs developed under Nuvia’s license agreements with Arm. Armalleged its approval was needed before these could be transferred to Qualcomm.

Qualcomm, which acquired Nuvia for $1.4 billion last year, said Arm has no right to interfere with Qualcomm’s or NUVIA's innovations. ""Arm’s complaint ignores the fact that Qualcomm has broad, well-established license rights covering its custom-designed CPU’s, and we are confident those rights will be affirmed,” saidAnn Chaplin, General Counsel of Qualcomm in a statement.

If Arm's effort is successful it would essentially unwind one of Qualcomm's biggest strategic acquisitions in recent years. read more

The lawsuit represents a major break between Qualcomm and Arm, one of Qualcomm's most important technology partners. Qualcomm has relied on Arm since it stopped designing its own custom computing cores. But in recent years, the companies have been at odds.

Some inside Qualcomm have privately complained that Arm’s pace of innovation is slackening, causing Qualcomm’s chips to fall behind Apple’s processors in performance.

Qualcomm bought Nuvia, founded by former Apple chip architects, to reboot its efforts to make custom computing cores that would be different from standard Arm designs used by rivals such as Taiwan chip designer MediaTek Inc. (2454.TW).

One of Qualcomm's first goals with Nuvia's technology is to challenge Intel Corp (INTC.O)and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O). in the PC and laptop markets which they now dominate. Qualcomm acquired Nuvia shortly after Apple ditched Intel to begin using its own chips, which are also based on Arm technology, in its Mac laptops.

Apple's move reinvigorated Mac sales, and Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon told Reuters he wanted to use Nuvia's Arm-based designs to do the same thing for the Windows-based laptop market. Arm would still make more money because Qualcomm pays it a royalty on each chip it sells that uses its technology. But it is possible the royalty rates could be lower under Nuvia's deal with Arm.

The arrangement highlights how much the two companies depend on each other, said Bob O'Donnell of TECHnalysis Research

""Qualcomm’s opportunity moving forward with the PC (and potentially server) business is utterly dependent on Nuvia designs, and Nuvia is the primary means by which Arm can get into Windows PCs. So the companies really need to partner well if they want to have a meaningful impact on the PC market,"" he said.

The deal was seen as a way for Qualcomm to lessen its reliance on Arm. In the past, most of Qualcomm's chips have used computing cores licensed directly from Arm, while Nuvia's cores use Arm's underlying architecture but are custom designs.

For Qualcomm, using more custom core designs - a move that Apple has also made - could lower some licensing costs to Arm in the short term and make it easier to move to a rival architecture in the longer term.

A source close to Arm said that its licenses with Qualcomm were not in dispute and that only technology developed under Nuvia's licenses was being contested in the lawsuit.

381,835,APPLE,2022-09-01,Disney’s synergy Force may stumble in Prime time,"













NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Few companies are as good at making the most of what they have as Walt Disney (DIS.N), which successfully cross-sells pirates, princesses, superheroes and stormtroopers across cinemas, TV screens, theme parks and stores. The latest idea to harness the power of its characters, however, may be too much even for the synergy Force.

The $200 billion entertainment empire led by Bob Chapek is chewing over the prospect of a membership program, à la Amazon.com’s (AMZN.O) Prime service, according to the Wall Street Journal. The e-commerce goliath represents the gold standard in bundling, with a $139 annual fee for free shipping, supermarket discounts, video streaming and other goodies also driving more spending by Prime members. Likewise, Apple (AAPL.O) users are willing to shell out for packages of cloud storage and more.

Cheaper Iron Man T-shirts and Disney World passes hardly qualify as the same sort of everyday needs that would necessarily entice droves of customers to sign up. The company’s lower forecast for subscriber growth at its streaming product Disney+ provides an incentive to find new sources of revenue, but worries about inflation and income growth are apt to restrict such discretionary purchases for a while. Even Disney’s magic may not be a match for economic reality. (By Jeffrey Goldfarb)

382,764,APPLE,2022-09-01,"Broadcom looks to defy chip slowdown on data center, wireless strength","













Sept 1 (Reuters) - Broadcom Inc forecast fourth-quarter revenue above estimates on Thursday as the semiconductor company expects resilient demand from businesses going digital to help it weather a likely chip industry slowdown.

Shares of the company rose 2.4% to $503 in extended trading after third-quarter results also sailed past expectations.

""From our vantage point, infrastructure demand is still very much holding,"" Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan told analysts.

Companies are increasingly investing in the infrastructure needed to support a switch to hybrid work models, giving Broadcom - which makes chips for data centers, routers and Wi-Fi modems - an edge over competitors with more exposure to smartphones and PCs.

Rivals Intel (INTC.O), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), Qualcomm (QCOM.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) have all issued demand warnings as consumers spend less on PCs, gaming devices and smartphones in the face of red-hot inflation.

Premium phones sales have so far held steady, however, as higher-income customers remain relatively unscathed. That has helped Broadcom, which counts Apple Inc (AAPL.O) as a major customer, forecast a 20% sequential jump in current-quarter wireless revenue.

Still, Broadcom may experience some weakness in demand in the upcoming quarters as enterprise, cloud and service providers are likely to moderate their orders and capex spending into 2023, said Summit Insights analyst Kinngai Chan.

""Our industry checks are now indicating some early signals of supply outpacing demand.""

Broadcom forecast current-quarter revenue of about $8.9 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $8.73 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Adjusted profit of $9.73 per share on revenue of $8.46 billion in the quarter ended July 31 surpassed expectations of $9.56 profit on revenue of $8.37 billion.

383,402,APPLE,2022-09-01,Ebooks plaintiffs scramble to salvage class action after magistrate calls for dismissal,"













(Reuters) - Plaintiffs' lawyers in an antitrust class action alleging that Amazon.com Inc conspired with five leading U.S. publishers to fix the price of ebooks argued in a new brief that a Manhattan federal magistrate erroneously disregarded obvious evidence of collusion when she recommended the dismissal of their case last month.

The basic facts presented in their amended complaint, in combination with elementary economic principles, are enough to justify their allegations, wrote plaintiffs' lawyers from Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro and Sperling & Slater. Within the course of several months in 2014 and 2015, the plaintiffs' firms said, the five big publishers – Penguin Random House LLC; HarperCollins Publishers LLC; Hachette Book Group Inc; Macmillan Publishing Group LLC; and Simon & Schuster Inc – each signed a pricing agreement with Amazon that allowed publishers to set ebook prices but locked in Amazon’s 30% “agency” fee for every ebook sale and guaranteed that Amazon’s prices could not be undercut by other ebook sellers.

Those deals, according to plaintiffs' lawyers, accomplished what both Amazon and the publishers wanted: They cemented Amazon’s overwhelming dominance of the ebooks market while allowing publishers to jack up prices.

“Those allegations are sufficient under the Sherman Act to set forth a prima facie antitrust claim against Amazon, regardless of any horizontal agreement among the publisher defendants,” plaintiffs' lawyers argued to U.S. District Judge Gregory Woods of Manhattan, who will decide whether to adopt the Aug. 3 report and recommendation from U.S. Magistrate Judge Valerie Figueredo. “The expected result under basic economic theory (and the result in fact) is what plaintiffs plead here: supracompetitive consumer prices.”

Figueredo's report recommended the dismissal of all three of the class action's Sherman Act claims: unlawful restraint of trade and conspiracy to monopolize against all of the defendants and monopolization against Amazon.

The magistrate found, broadly speaking, that the plaintiffs failed to offer evidence that the publishers colluded with each other or with Amazon when they struck their deals in 2014 and 2015. It’s entirely plausible, Figueredo said, that each publisher made the same rational, independent determination that it needed to preserve its access to Amazon, the dominant ebooks distributor. Moreover, she said, each publisher could rationally have expected that its competitors would have reached the same conclusion. In essence, she said the publishers didn’t need to collude on a strategy for dealing with Amazon because they each knew what the industry as a whole needed to accomplish.

Under the rigorous test for antitrust pleadings, Figueredo said, plaintiffs alleging collusion have to show more than parallel actions by accused conspirators. Here, she said, ebook consumers didn't satisfy that test. None of the theories alleged in the ebooks complaint – including assertions that publishers acted against their self-interest; that they have a history of collusion dating back to an alleged conspiracy with Apple Inc; and that ebook prices rose despite no rise in production costs – were “more consistent with a conspiracy than with rational behavior independently adopted by the publishers acting within a concentrated market,” Figueredo said.

The magistrate also rejected plaintiffs’ allegation that, in combination, the publishers’ individual agreements acted as a restraint on competition under “rule of reason” analysis. Figueredo said plaintiffs failed to show that any single publisher had the market power to dictate terms across the industry.

“Absent some evidence of coordination,” she said, “there are no plausible allegations in the from which to infer that a single publisher’s agreement with Amazon led to a market-wide price increase for trade eBooks.”

In their new brief urging Woods to countermand the magistrate’s recommendations, plaintiffs argued that Figueredo missed the big picture. Hagens Berman, as you surely remember, previously won a $450 million settlement with Apple after the U.S. Justice Department sued the company for conspiring with publishers in an effort to break Amazon’s grip on the ebooks market. (Publishers entered consent judgments with the government but did not concede guilt.) It should be obvious, plaintiffs said in their new brief, that the same collusive motive drove the publishers’ pricing agreements with Amazon once they were out from under government oversight.

“The publisher defendants never withdrew from their conspiracy,” the brief said. “Instead, the publisher defendants went back to Amazon to continue where they left off … In short, while the competitive self-interests of the publisher defendants, acting alone, were at odds with Amazon’s retail market dominance, it benefitted each of them as long as they acted collectively.”

Rather than looking at each publisher’s market share, the brief said, the magistrate should have looked at the cumulative impact of their parallel agreements. If Figueredo had applied the proper rule-of-reason test, Hagens Berman and Sperling & Slater argued, she would have concluded, as courts did in the Apple ebooks litigation, that the publishers’ deals with Amazon reduced competition and led to higher prices for consumers.

I emailed Amazon’s lawyers, John Schmidtlein, Jonathan Pitt and Carl Metz of Williams & Connolly, but didn’t hear back. Macmillan counsel Joel Mitnick of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft and Simon & Schuster counsel Yehudah Buchweitz of Weil, Gotshal & Manges declined to comment on plaintiffs’ new brief. I did not receive responses from the other publishers’ lawyers: Jennifer Patterson and Scott Lent of Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer for Penguin Random House and HarperCollins and Rich Snyder of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer for Hachette.

The docket does not indicate whether the defendants intend to respond to plaintiffs' arguments about the magistrate's report. There's also no indication of when Woods will rule on dismissal.

Law firms Related documents Heirs said tech companies sold 'bootleg' versions of music

Amazon, Google, Microsoft also previously sued















(Reuters) - Apple Inc has settled a copyright dispute with the heirs of the songwriters behind ""Get Happy,"" ""Stormy Weather,"" ""That's Amore"" and other hits from the Tin Pan Alley music era of the early 20th century, according to Wednesday filings in San Francisco federal court.

The settlement marks the end of a series of lawsuits against Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft for allegedly selling ""bootleg"" digital versions of those and other songs written by Harold Arlen, Harry Warren and Ray Henderson.

The heirs' attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday, and neither did Apple or one of its attorneys.

Arlen is best known for writing ""Over the Rainbow"" and other popular songs from the early 1900s, including ""I've Got the World on a String"" and ""The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea."" Henderson wrote standards including ""Bye Bye Blackbird,"" and Warren's best-known songs include ""At Last"" and ""I Only Have Eyes for You.""

Beginning in 2019, the heirs accused the tech companies of selling pirated recordings of dozens of songs. The lawsuits said the companies offered song downloads from entities that were ""simply duplicating previously released recordings and selling them as if they were the rightful owner"" for lower prices than authorized versions.

U.S. District Judge William Orrick said in March that Apple did not infringe the heirs' copyrights willfully, but may be liable for making the recordings available on the iTunes Store.

The parties reached a settlement on Wednesday, according to an entry on the court docket. The heirs settled their disputes with Amazon, Microsoft and Google last year.

The cases are SA Music LLC v. Apple Inc, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Nos. 3:20-cv-02146, 3:20-cv-02794 and 3:20-cv-02965.

385,352,APPLE,2022-09-01,Russia's Mir Pay sees users increase 20-fold after rivals exit -report,"Summary

Summary Companies This content was produced in Russia where the law restricts coverage of Russian military operations in Ukraine















MOSCOW, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Russian contactless payment system Mir Pay has seen its user numbers increase 20-fold this summer from a year earlier, the Vedomosti daily reported on Thursday, after Google and Apple limited their payment services in the country.

Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O) and Apple (AAPL.O) were among the scores of Western companies to scale back operations after Russia sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Mir Pay, a mobile application developed by the Bank of Russia's National Card Payment System (NSPK), is now one of the few contactless systems available to Russians, and currently only available on Android devices.

Citing an NSPK representative who did not disclose concrete figures, Vedomosti reported that Mir Pay users increased by five times in July and the number of monthly payments by seven times.

Online bank Tinkoff, owned by TCS Group Holding (TCSq.L), launched its Tinkoff Pay system in May, joining Gazprombank's (GZPRI.MM) Gazprom Pay and Sberbank's (SBER.MM) SberPay on the market, though none are fully comparable to those offered by Apple and Google, analysts have said.

386,690,APPLE,2022-09-02,Social media app Parler returns to Google's Play Store,"













Sept 2 (Reuters) - Parler, a social media app popular with U.S. conservatives, is returning to Google's app store more than 1-1/2 years after the Alphabet Inc-owned (GOOGL.O) company removed it following the U.S. Capitol riots in January 2021.

The app was launched in 2018 and styled itself as a free-speech space for those seeking an alternative to platforms such as Twitter (TWTR.N). It quickly gained traction from supporters of former U.S. President Donald Trump.

However, major tech platforms cut ties with Parler for failing to police violent content that led to the attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters.

The app is now being reinstated after it undertook a series of measures to moderate content on the platform, including features to block abusive users and remove content that could incite violence, a Google spokesperson said.

Parler has substantially modified its app to comply with Play Store's policies and will be available for download from Friday, the spokesperson added.

""Parler has a strong commitment to free speech and despite the market duopoly, is working to provide options and choices for the millions of voices currently being censored or suppressed based on their viewpoint,"" said Christina Cravens, Parler's marketing chief.

To be sure, Parler had made its app available for Android phones through a separate version that could be downloaded on its website after it was removed from Play Store.

Apple Inc (AAPL.O) reinstated the app on its App Store in May last year. read more

Exports median forecast +9.5% y/y (prior month +14.2%)

Imports median forecast +7.1% y/y (prior month +19.4%)

Balance median forecast $4.23 bln (prior month $5.03 bln)

CPI median forecast +3.05% y/y (prior month +3.36%)















TAIPEI, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Taiwan's exports likely rose for the 26th straight month in August although at a slower pace than in July, amid fears of a global recession, uncertainties due to the Ukraine conflict, and COVID-19 flare-ups in China, according to a Reuters poll.

Taiwan, a global hub for chip production and a key supplier to Apple Inc (AAPL.O), is one of Asia's leading exporters of technology goods. The trade data is seen as an important gauge of world demand for tech gadgets.

Exports last month were estimated to have risen 9.5% from a year earlier, a Reuters poll of 13 analysts showed on Friday, slower than the 14.2% jump in July. read more

The export forecasts all predicted increases but ranged widely between 3% and 12.06%, reflecting uncertainties over the global economy, supply chain disruptions due to pandemic lockdowns in China, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Taiwan's Finance Ministry predicted August exports would increase by 8% to 12% from a year earlier.

Separately, the consumer price index was expected to have risen 3.05% in August from a year earlier, a slightly slower rate than 3.36% in July.

The inflation data will be released on Tuesday, followed by trade data on Wednesday.

388,292,APPLE,2022-09-02,Self-driving tech firm Aurora mulls sale to Apple or Microsoft - Bloomberg News,"













Sept 2 (Reuters) - Aurora Innovation Inc (AUR.O) Chief Executive Chris Urmson recently outlined several options for the self-driving tech firm to combat challenging market conditions, including a possible sale to Apple Inc (AAPL.O) or Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Bloomberg News reported on Friday.

Many electric-vehicle and self-driving startups that had raised cash easily through IPOs and mergers with blank-check firms during the market boom are now scrambling to launch vehicles and burning cash rapidly amid a bleak economy and supply-chain snarls.

Reuters reported in 2020 that Apple was moving forward with its self-driving car technology and was targeting 2024 to produce a passenger vehicle that could include its own breakthrough battery technology.

Microsoft, on the other hand, has invested in San Francisco-based self-driving car maker Cruise, which is valued at $30 billion and counts General Motors Co (GM.N) as a majority stakeholder.

Urmson, who co-founded Aurora after running Google owner Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) self-driving car project, also floated measures including cost cuts, taking the company private and spinning off or selling assets, the report said, citing an internal memo. (https://bloom.bg/3ReFDgP)

Aurora declined to comment.

Shares of the company closed 15% higher on Friday, but have lost nearly 80% this year, in a sign of its struggles since going public late last year with a blank-check firm. It has a market cap of about $2.4 billion.

Last month, Aurora said it would delay the delivery of its scalable autonomous freight trucks by a year to the first half of 2024, citing supply constraints.

Other options Urmson suggested in the memo were to buy companies in the sector with $150 million to $300 million of cash, and to freeze hiring and lay off employees, the Bloomberg report said.

Summary

Summary Companies Lengthy safety approval times hobble India's tech industry

Move to speed clearances follows lobbying by industry

Initiative aims to cut five to eight weeks from testing time

India eyes electronics hardware sector worth $300 bln by 2026















NEW DELHI, Sept 2 (Reuters) - India will try out a strategy of parallel testing to speed up safety approvals for new electronic devices, an industry group told Reuters on Friday, a move that could boost device launch plans by the likes of Samsung (005930.KS) and Apple (AAPL.O).

The move comes as India scrambles to remove bottlenecks faced by businesses, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi bullish on an electronics hardware manufacturing industry his government targets to be worth $300 billion by 2026.

The plan to test different components of the devices simultaneously looks set to cut as much as five to eight weeks from the 16 to 21 now often needed to test and certify products ranging from wireless earbuds to smartphones.

""For industry, it is directly linked with ease of doing business; for consumers, this will result in faster access to the latest products,"" the group, MAIT, said in its statement.

Firms such as Apple, Samsung and Xiaomi (1810.HK) are among its members, along with global and domestic firms operating in India's electronics, telecom and IT sector.

To trim the time required, the group added, the testing agency, the Bureau of Indian Standards, ""has agreed to a pilot project where some identified electronics hardware products shall be undergoing parallel testing"".

Executives say India's cumbersome testing process can take 16 weeks for a new Apple AirPods model, for example, as the charging case and its components must first secure clearance before the earbuds are assessed.

For a smartphone and its parts, the procedure could take an average of up to 21 weeks.

The pilot decision followed a closed-door meeting on Wednesday between officials of India's information technology ministry, BIS, MAIT and executives of firms such as Apple and Samsung, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said.

Apple, Samsung and Xiaomi did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The BIS and the IT ministry also did not immediately respond to Reuters queries.

Earbuds will be the first devices likely to be put through the faster testing, with the government deciding on other products later, MAIT said.

Swifter safety and quality clearances by the authorities will boost India's competitiveness in electronics, said Prabhu Ram, the head of the Industry Intelligence Group at CyberMedia Research.

""For Indian consumers, this move will significantly shorten the wait time to get their hands on the latest products,"" added Ram, who advises technology companies in India.

The requirement for safety testing by BIS applies to all electronic products in India, whether imported or domestically made.

The move will come as a shot in the arm for companies such as Xiaomi and Samsung which sell most smartphones in India and have a combined market share of 46%, as well as Apple, which trails Samsung in the premium category, data from research firm Counterpoint shows.

While Indian company boAt leads the market for wireless earbuds in India, Apple is the market leader in premium variants, data showed.

390,73,APPLE,2022-09-06,Apple to appeal Brazil sales ban of iPhone without charger,"













SAO PAULO, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O)said on Tuesday it will appeal a Brazilian order banning it from selling iPhones without a battery charger, pushing back on claims that the company provides an incomplete product to consumers.

The Justice Ministry fined Apple 12.275 million reais ($2.38 million) and ordered the company to cancel sales of the iPhone 12 and newer models, in addition to suspending the sale of any iPhone model that does not come with a charger.

In the order, published on Tuesday in the country's official gazette, the ministry argued that the iPhone was lacking a essential component in a ""deliberate discriminatory practice against consumers.""

The authorities rejected Apple's argument that the practice had the purpose of reducing carbon emissions, saying there is no evidence that selling the smartphone without a charger offers environmental protections.

Apple said it would continue to work with Brazilian consumer protection agency Senacon in order to ""resolve their concerns,"" while saying it would appeal the decision.

""We have already won several court rulings in Brazil on this matter and we are confident that our customers are aware of the various options for charging and connecting their devices,"" Apple said.

The order comes a day before Apple is expected to announce its new iPhone model.

391,336,APPLE,2022-09-06,Factbox: What is expected at Apple's 'Far Out' fall event?,"













Sept 6 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) will likely unveil a new line of iPhones, Watch Series 8 and other products on Wednesday at an event awaited by Wall Street and its legions of customers.

The event, ""Far Out"", will begin at 1700 GMT at the Steve Jobs Theater in Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California. It is the company's first indoor event since the pandemic.

Based on reports, here are some of the expected announcements:

IPHONE 14

Apple usually launches new iPhones at the September event. The latest device is expected to include updates to the camera, storage and design, as well as satellite network connectivity.

The ""mini"" version of the iPhone may be discontinued, according to reports.

Pricing and bundling options for Apple's flagship product will be watched closely as decades-high inflation batters demand for all, but the most premium smartphones.

""Apple could choose to increase the price of the Pro models and leave the lower end models unchanged,"" BofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan said.

SATELLITE NETWORK CONNECTIVITY

Satellite network connectivity was one of the test features for iPhone 14 before mass production, said TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, known for his accurate predictions related to Apple's product launches.

The possible feature would allow users to send emergency text messages in situations where they are without a network.

APPLE WATCH

The Watch Series 8 is expected have a bigger display and more health features, including a body-temperature sensor.

The company may also launch a Pro version of the Watch.

AIRPODS PRO 2

The new model will likely feature enhanced sound quality and more sensors. Its case is expected to be water and sweat resistant, with support for magsafe wireless charging.

Some reports suggest the case could have a type-C port.

AUGMENTED REALITY/VIRTUAL REALITY HEADSETS?

There has been curiosity among investors and fans about a mixed reality headset, but analysts do not expect the product to be launched until next year because of ongoing supply chain bottlenecks.

""There could be some clues around a new AR/VR product although unlikely to be launched before 2023,"" BofA Securities' Mohan said.

393,51,APPLE,2022-09-07,Apple picks Globalstar for emergency satellite service on iPhone 14,"













Sept 7 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Wednesday selected Globalstar Inc (GSAT.A) as its partner for a feature that would allow iPhone 14 users to send emergency messages from remote locations.

The tech giant said it was dedicating $450 million from its advanced manufacturing fund toward satellite infrastructure to support the feature. GlobalStar will receive the majority of the funding, but the iPhone maker did not specify which other players will receive the rest and in what form.

While Apple will pay for 95% of the approved capital expenditure for the new Globalstar satellites needed to support the service, Globalstar said it would still need to raise additional debt to construct and deploy the satellites.

Globalstar, which makes low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites, said it had tapped investment bank Goldman Sachs & Co and expects to complete a financing in the fourth quarter of 2022.

LEO satellites operate 36 times closer to the earth than traditional ones and hence take less time to send and receive information, leading to faster broadband service even in remote areas.

Globalstar's shares were trading slightly higher after the bell. They had jumped more than 20% in regular trading but reversed course to finish lower on Wednesday.

The latest iPhones start at $799 and will be available later this month, Apple said at its ""Far Out"" event. read more

The satellite message feature will be available through a software upgrade on iPhone 14 models, which include extra hardware to send the messages, in November.

The service will be free for two years with the iPhone 14. Apple did not say what would happen after that period.

The service will start in the United States and Canada and will roll out to other markets in the coming months, the company said.

395,281,APPLE,2022-09-07,"In casino app cases against Apple, Google and Meta, judge queries 9th Circ. on immunity issue","













(Reuters) - It is a rare and wondrous thing for a federal judge to admit that he could use some help interpreting complicated precedent.

So cheers are in order for U.S. District Judge Edward Davila of San Jose, California, who is presiding over three big class actions in which consumers allege that Apple Inc, Google LLC and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc promote illegal online gambling through so-called social casino apps.

In a consolidated Sept. 2 decision addressing all three cases, Davila rejected two of the plaintiffs’ theories of liability against the online platforms, holding that Google, Apple and Facebook are immune under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act from claims that they offered access to the casino apps and provided the app developers with data and other services to help them target big spenders and retain users.

Davila refused to dismiss plaintiffs’ third claim, ruling that Section 230 does not shield the websites from liability for processing (and taking a cut) of consumers’ payments for the virtual “chips” required by the casino apps.

But Davila said he might be wrong about the scope of Section 230 immunity – and that it makes sense to find out sooner rather than later what the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals thinks of his decision. The judge invoked a provision of the U.S. Code that allows trial courts, on their own, to certify certain rulings for interlocutory appeals.

“This case involves controlling questions of law, namely whether the platforms are entitled to immunity for their hosting of the allegedly unlawful social casino apps,” Davila wrote. “While the court believes it has followed the 9th Circuit's precedent on this complicated question, the court finds that reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome.”

In such circumstances, the judge said, an immediate appeal will ensure that no one wastes time and money litigating cases whose parameters could change drastically if Davila misinterpreted 9th Circuit precedent.

The parties must still petition the 9th Circuit to grant review of Davila’s decision, but the judge’s certification substantially increases the odds that the appeals court will hear the case before the litigation goes any farther. After all, as Davila pointed out, if the 9th Circuit disagrees with his holding that the Apple, Google and Meta can be held liable for processing payments for gambling chips, the litigation is over. (The judge stayed the underlying cases until the 9th Circuit decides whether to take up the appeal.)

Lead plaintiffs lawyer Rafey Balabanian of Edelson said the judge was right to tee up the case for the 9th Circuit. “The court's choice to make the decision immediately appealable is a welcome one,” Balabanian said in an email statement. “This case puts at issue tens of billions of dollars lost by ordinary hard-working Americans, and Section 230 is one of the platforms' primary defenses. We believe that an affirmance by the 9th Circuit will provide a clear roadmap for the remainder of these cases."" (Edelson has previously won hundreds of millions in settlements from social casino apps the firm accused of facilitating illegal online gambling.)

I also reached out to Apple counsel from DLA Piper, Google lawyers from Baker & McKenzie and Facebook counsel from Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. Apple and Google lawyers did not respond. Christopher Chorba from Gibson Dunn referred me to Facebook, which didn’t provide comment on Davila’s ruling or his certification of the decision for immediate appeal.

The judge’s decision methodically analyzed the 9th Circuit’s key precedent on the scope of Section 230 immunity. The critical question, according to Davila's reading of such cases as 2016’s Doe v. Internet Brands Inc and 2021’s Gonzalez v. Google LLC is whether plaintiffs are attempting to blame platforms for their own alleged misconduct or for alleged misconduct by third parties whose content appears on the platforms.

In the Doe case, for instance, the 9th Circuit ruled that Section 230 did not shield a website from an aspiring model’s allegations that it negligently failed to warn her and other users that two rapists were using the site to lure women to fake auditions. And in the Gonzalez decision, the appeals court held that Google was not liable to terrorism victims for airing ISIS videos on YouTube – but that Section 230 did not immunize the company from claims that it assisted ISIS by sharing advertising revenue with the group.

“Liability turns on the degree of control that a website exercises over the offensive content,” Davila concluded. “Section 230 is not limitless. While its origin demonstrates a preference for immunity, it is not meant to immunize a website's own bad acts.”

Applying that standard to the allegations in casino app cases, Davila said it was easy to dismiss claims that Google, Apple and Facebook were liable for offering access to – and even promoting — social casino apps. The judge said it was tougher to decide whether Section 230 precludes claims that the platforms helped the gambling apps attain and attract users by offering design and advertising advice and data analytics. Davila decided that although Google, Apple and Facebook benefited financially from the casino apps' popularity, their support was akin to publishing advice and therefore shielded by Section 230.

But plaintiffs’ allegation that Google, Apple and Facebook enabled the sale of virtual chips to be used for online gambling, Davila said, is “grounded in the platforms' own bad acts, not in the content of the social casino apps that the platforms display on their websites.” The judge said that in his analysis, Section 230 does not immunize online platforms for their own participation in allegedly illegal transactions.

If I were a betting woman — which I am not — I’d guess that the 9th Circuit will agree to review Davila’s decision, given the magnitude of consumers’ alleged losses and the novelty of their surviving theory.

Even if the appeals court disagrees with Davila's conclusions, the judge is a winner in my book.

396,669,APPLE,2022-09-07,Netflix looks to control cloud computing costs with AWS - WSJ,"













Sept 7 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) is trying to better control rising cloud computing costs with longtime cloud partner Amazon Web Services as part of its efforts to reduce total expenses, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with that work.

The streaming giant is also hiring more junior staff, paring back its real-estate footprint and reducing the number of copies of data and content it stores around the world, the report said.

The company, which is struggling with lost subscribers and increased competition from companies including Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O), did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Netflix is trying to grow its subscriber base to as many as 500 million customers globally in the next three years. It lost 970,000 subscribers from April through June and offered a forecast below Wall Street expectations for the current quarter. read more

In June, Netflix said that it laid off 300 employees, or about 4% of its workforce, in the second round of job cuts to reign in cost. (https://reut.rs/3RrAthC)

According to the report, the California-based company is hiring more junior employees - from interns to recent college graduates - as part of an expanded ""emerging talent"" recruitment initiative.

397,155,APPLE,2022-09-07,"Apple offers adventure watch, satellite SOS iPhone — and steady prices","













Sept 7 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Wednesday avoided price hikes of its best-selling iPhones during its biggest product launch of the year, focusing on safety upgrades rather than flashy new technical specs with the exception of a new adventure-focused watch.

The iPhone maker leaned into safety technologies like the ability to detect a car accident and summon a rescue from a remote mountaintop to add allure to its devices. Apple positioned itself as the brand to allow users to pursue excitement and adventure - with a safety net.

Such intangible features ""are the things that make you not just want the products for yourself, but also for loved ones,"" said Ben Bajarin, head of consumer technologies at Creative Strategies. ""Ultimately, the increased emphasis on safety - safety as a service - is super interesting as a value proposition.""

The iPhone lineup that generates half of Apple's sales got tweaks to cameras and battery life, though only the iPhone Pro lineup got an upgrade to a completely new processor chip.

Prices of the high-end iPhone 14s are the same as last year's iPhone 13 models. But Apple dropped its cheapest option, the iPhone Mini, meaning its lowest-priced model now costs $100 more than last year.

The iPhone 14 will start at $799 and the iPhone 14 Plus at $899 and be available for preorder starting Sept. 9. The iPhone Pro will cost $999 and the iPhone Pro Max $1,099 and be available Sept. 16. read more

""They decided to essentially maintain pricing despite inflationary pressure,"" said D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte.

Nintendo (7974.T) and T-Mobile (TMUS.O) have also said they will hold off on price increases.

Apple said its satellite SOS feature will work with emergency responders. It also said that users will be able to use its FindMy app to share their location via satellite when they have no other connectivity.

The service will be free for two years with the iPhone 14. Apple did not say what would happen after that period.

Shares in Globalstar Inc (GSAT.A) jumped 20% on Wednesday after the satellite services firm announced it will be the satellite operator for Apple's emergency SOS service. read more

The Cupertino, California-based company also showed a trio of new Apple Watches, including a new Watch Ultra model aimed at extreme sports and diving and designed to challenge sportswatch specialists such as Garmin (GRMN.BN) and Polar.

""Apple is competing for a consumer segment that already has high loyalty towards their existing products and vendors, and it will need to prove itself over time,"" said Runar Bjorhovde, an analyst at Canalys.

On the watch front, the $799 Ultra has a bigger battery to last through events like triathlons and better waterproofing and temperature resistance to operate in outdoor environments, as well as better GPS tracking for sports.

All of the watches - which include a Series 8 priced the same as last year and an updated, cheaper SE model - and new iPhones will have the ability to detect when a user has been in a serious car crash and call emergency services.

The new Series 8 watch has a temperature sensor that will retroactively detect ovulation. The company emphasized the privacy approach of its cycle tracking. Privacy and reproductive health data has become a focus for tech companies in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that ended a constitutional right to abortion in the United States.

But while accessories like the Apple Watch have driven incremental sales from Apple's existing user base, the iPhone remains the bedrock of its business with 52.4% of sales in its most recent fiscal year, and investors continue to wonder what, if anything, will be the company's next major product category.

Analysts expect that category to be a mixed reality headset that could come to market as soon as next year, but Apple gave no hints at those potential products on Wednesday.

Apple's stock closed up 0.9%, lagging the S&P 500's gain of 1.8% for the session.

398,41,APPLE,2022-09-07,"Union groups, investors seek worker rights review at Apple","













Sept 7 (Reuters) - Labor groups and investors have filed a shareholder proposal asking Apple Inc (AAPL.O) to review how it treats workers' rights, looking to build on recent momentum to unionize workers at the iPhone maker's retail stores.

The proposal filed by a group including SOC Investment Group, a consultant to union pension funds, and an arm of the Service Employees International Union, accuses Apple of an ""apparent misalignment"" between its public commitments to things like freedom of association and accusations it has tried to unfairly deter union organizing.

""If a corporation's values and their behavior diverge, that's a problem,"" said Dieter Waizenegger, SOC executive director.

An Apple representative declined to comment.

The company is scheduled to hold an event Wednesday where it is expected to introduce new iPhones. read more

Other filers of the proposal include New York City Comptroller Brad Lander who oversees pension funds, Trillium Asset Management and Parnassus Investments.

Apple is among American companies that face unionization efforts along with Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and Amazon Inc (AMZN.O).

Workers at a Maryland Apple store voted to unionize in June and efforts are under way in other states. read more

Shareholder proposals for Apple's 2023 annual meeting are due Sept 8.

At this year's meeting on March 4 two resolutions won a majority of votes cast including one asking Apple to conduct a civil rights audit whose filers included some of the same union-affiliated investors.

The other successful resolution asked Apple for a review of its use of non-disclosure clauses and other agreements that limit worker speech.

Filer Kristin Hull, chief executive officer of Nia Impact Capital, said the firm has not been able to meet with Apple's board since. Nia has submitted a new resolution for 2023 asking board members be more accessible.

HONG KONG, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers in Asia are bullish on Vietnam's growth prospects and selectively looking to invest in emerging technological opportunities in China.

At the annual Sohn investment conference in Hong Kong this week, hedge fund managers spoke about how to profit from Vietnam's fast-growing economy and prospects for a boost in domestic consumption amid the simmering Sino-U.S. tensions.

Their other top picks in the region included an Apple supplier and a caller identifying app.

Seth Fischer, founder and chief investment officer of activist investor Oasis Management, said he is long Vingroup (VIC.HM), Vietnam's largest conglomerate and a proxy for the economy.

Fischer’s picks include the exchangeable bonds issued by the group and its hospitality unit Vinpearl as well as Vinhomes (VHM.HM) stocks – a real estate development unit of the group.

""Vietnam is like 20 years behind China, population is really young,"" said Fischer, who is a long-term investor in China and Japan.

He said the demand was coming from people upgrading their own property rather than buying a second home.

The housing supply in Vietnam cannot catch up with the demand, Fischer added, which is fundamentally different from the property crisis China is facing.

Rajesh Sachdeva, CEO and founding partner at Singapore-based Flowering Tree Investment Management pitched Vietnam Prosperity JSC Bank at the conference, touting its Alipay-like ecosystem.

Sachdeva believes the private bank is likely to continue to gain market share against its state-owned competitors and said it is now among the manager’s top 5 positions, rising from top 10 positions in 2018.

Fund managers also pitched companies in emerging sectors with strong research and development capabilities.

Jojo Hu, founder of Hong Kong-based Pacific Crest Partners, pitched China’s “little giant” -- Sunresin New Material (300487.SZ), a leading adsorption resin producer listed in Shenzhen, predicting a 1.3 times return on the stock by 2025.

""For investments in China, we have entered into a new stage. There are fewer good ideas in internet and consumer space. Now we must look for companies with similar characteristics in emerging sectors,"" said Hu.

Iris Wang, founding partner & CIO of TruMed Investment Management is bullish on Joinn Laboratories China , a top player in China’s non-clinical drug safety assessment market, listed in both Hong Kong and Shanghai. Wang forecasts the company will rise between 150%-200% in three years.

Technology companies remained hot choices at the Sohn conference, despite the sell-off in the sector this year.

Wei Luo, founder of AIIM Investment, picked Unimicron Technology Corp (3037.TW), a major ABF substrate supplier in Taiwan and an Apple supplier.

Nishchay Goel, founder of Singapore-based Duro Capital, an India-focused investment firm, picked Truecaller, a Sweden-based, India-focused caller identifying app that tackles spam call problems and generates major revenue from digital advertising.

Fischer told Reuters his fund has invested in some Chinese real estate companies in recent months, both in equities and debt. He continues to be bullish in Japan, as it is one of the only places where inflation “might even be a tailwind”.

Sept 8 (Reuters) - Elon Musk said on Thursday that his company SpaceX had promising talks with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) over using Starlink's satellite services to underpin the iPhone 14's new emergency SOS feature.

""We've had some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity,"" Musk said in a tweet.

""For sure, closing link from space to phone will work best if phone software and hardware adapt to space-based signals vs Starlink purely emulating cell tower,"" he said. (https://bit.ly/3eD2i8p)

At the launch of iPhone 14 on Wednesday, Apple said it had selected satellite services firm Globalstar Inc (GSAT.A) as its partner to power the feature that helps users sends emergency messages from remote locations. read more

Apple said it had also dedicated $450 million from its advanced manufacturing fund toward satellite infrastructure to support the service, which is currently available in the United States and Canada.

U.S wireless carrier T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) has said it will use Starlink satellites to provide mobile users with network access in parts of the United States, allowing users to connect mobile phones directly to satellites in orbit.

SINGAPORE, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Wednesday kept prices for its latest iPhone stable in the United States, but raised prices in some Asian countries where currencies have dropped against the dollar in the past year. read more

Buyers of the basic iPhone 14 in Japan - where the yen has slumped 24% since September - will pay 20% more than they did for the iPhone 13 when it was launched a year ago at 99,800 yen ($692.81).

The iPhone 13 currently costs 107,800 yen in Japan. Earlier this year, Apple hiked the price of the model by nearly a fifth to 117,800 yen after the yen weakened. read more

The dollar's strength is the biggest risk to Apple's earnings, Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a note.

""Demand for Apple remains strong in the U.S. and Europe, while Japan is likely under pressure given recent price increases and limited subsidies,"" they said.

Shares of Apple were trading slightly lower amid a decline in the broader market.

In China, though, Apple's third-largest market after the United States, the company priced the iPhone 14 at 5,999 yuan ($862.42) - the same as the iPhone 13 launch price - despite a 7% drop in the currency.

Analysts have said Apple should brace for a weakening of demand in China, where the economy has been hurt by a series of COVID-19 lockdowns that have squeezed consumer spending.

Apple's April-June quarterly revenue in Greater China fell 1% after a streak of strong quarters in the region. read more

The company had previously announced discounts on iPhones in China, where the iPhone 13 is now available at 5,399 yuan.

402,850,APPLE,2022-09-08,White House unveils principles for Big Tech reform,"













WASHINGTON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The White House on Thursday outlined six principles to reform Big Tech platforms and said it was encouraged to see bipartisan interest in Congress to rein in major U.S. tech companies.

The six principles, entitled ""Enhancing Competition and Tech Platform Accountability,"" were released after Biden administration officials earlier in the day met with experts to discuss ""the harms that tech platforms cause and the need for greater accountability.""

The White House said the United States needs ""clear rules of the road to ensure small and mid-size businesses and entrepreneurs can compete on a level playing field.""

""These principles are the culmination of months of work by the administration and engagement with numerous stakeholders,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. ""We're looking forward to hearing any feedback from the tech companies.""

A group of bipartisan lawmakers has introduced antitrust legislation aimed at reining in the four tech giants -- Meta Platform's (META.O) Facebook, Apple (AAPL.O), Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) -- that would bar the companies from favoring their own businesses in search results and other ways. The lawmakers have said they believe they have the 60 Senate votes needed to move forward, but no vote has yet been scheduled.

Among issues discussed at Thursday's meeting, which included numerous senior White House officials, District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine and technology experts, were antitrust, privacy, algorithmic discrimination and other tech policy areas, the White House said.

The six principles include promoting technology sector competition; adopting robust federal privacy protections, and tougher privacy and online protections for children; rescinding special legal protections for large tech platforms; increasing transparency about platforms' algorithms and content moderation decisions; and ending discriminatory algorithmic decision-making.

""The rise of tech platforms has introduced new and difficult challenges,"" the White House said, ""from the tragic acts of violence linked to toxic online cultures, to deteriorating mental health and wellbeing, to basic rights of Americans and communities worldwide suffering from the rise of tech platforms big and small.""

Sept 8 (Reuters) - Russians will have the chance to buy the new Apple iPhone 14 despite the U.S. tech company having left the country thanks to Moscow's parallel import scheme, a senior government official told the RIA Novosti news agency on Thursday.

Russia announced the scheme in March when it authorised retailers to import products from abroad without the trademark owner's permission. read more

Asked whether the new iPhone, unveiled by Apple on Wednesday, would be imported under the scheme, Trade and Industry Minister Denis Manturov said: ""Why not? If consumers want to buy these phones, yes. There will be the opportunity.""

Apple halted new product sales in Russia in March, a week after Russia invaded Ukraine, though the iPhone, MacBook and other Apple goods have remained available in Russian stores as retailers sell down their remaining stock of old models and get hold of newly released devices through the import scheme.

Russian mobile network MTS on Thursday morning was already selling the new iPhone 14 models on pre-order. Prices start from 84,990 roubles ($1,398) for the 128GB version.

MTS said delivery could take up to 120 days and it retained the right to cancel orders if it faced difficulties importing the products.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request to comment.

Manturov, who is also a deputy prime minister, said last month that the scheme, which covers Western products ranging from luxury clothes to cars, could reach $16 billion in value this year, equivalent to around 4% of Russia's 2021 imports. read more

Companies Law firms Judge says Apple brought damages argument too late in VirnetX case

Apple could still win if PTO patent-validity ruling stands















(Reuters) - A long-running dispute between Apple Inc and patent licensing company VirnetX Inc over privacy-software technology went back to a U.S. appeals court on Thursday for a panel of judges to hear Apple's new challenges to a $502 million jury loss in Texas.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard Apple's request to toss the jury verdict, as well as VirnetX's appeal of a U.S. Patent Office tribunal decision to cancel its virtual private network (VPN) patents that also would negate the award if it stands.

The 12-year fight has included five trials and three trips to the appeals court.

""I'm pretty sure this dispute will never end between these two companies,"" Chief U.S. Circuit Judge Kimberly Moore said during Thursday oral arguments.

VirnetX sued Apple in 2010, alleging that VPN technology in Apple's iPhones, iPads and computers infringed its patents. After several trials and appeals, a jury awarded VirnetX $502 million in damages in 2020.

Apple's attorney Bill Lee of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr argued Thursday that the verdict should be thrown out because the jury's royalty rate was based on flawed calculations by VirnetX's damages expert.

Lee said there was no evidence that any Apple customers used VirnetX's patented technology, which is ""disabled by default"" in Apple's software, and that the calculation failed to take this into account.

But Moore said Apple brought the argument too late, even though it was ""very simple and persuasive.""

""That argument was sitting there to be made as part of your last appeal, and you didn't make it,"" Moore said.

Both Lee and VirnetX's attorney Jeff Lamken of MoloLamken acknowledged that Apple would win the case if Patent Trial and Appeal Board rulings invalidating VirnetX's patents are upheld. VirnetX asked the Federal Circuit to overturn the PTAB decisions in a separate oral argument Thursday.

VirnetX attorney Stephen Kinnaird of Paul Hastings argued that the board misinterpreted the patents.

Moore sat on the panels in both cases with Circuit Judges Leonard Stark and Todd Hughes.

VirnetX separately won $440 million from Apple on allegations that the tech giant used its internet-security technology in features like FaceTime video calls, which Apple said it has paid.

The appeals are VirnetX Inc v. Apple Inc, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, No. 21-1672 and VirnetX Inc v Mangrove Partners Master Fund Ltd, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, No. 20-2271.

405,527,APPLE,2022-09-09,EU to consult on making Big Tech contribute to telco network costs,"













PARIS/BRUSSELS, Sept 9 (Reuters) - The European Union's executive body will launch a consultation early next year on whether tech giants should bear some of the costs of Europe's telecoms network, EU industry chief Thierry Breton said on Friday.

Europe's telecoms operators have long lobbied for a financial contribution from U.S. tech firm's such as Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O), Meta's Facebook and Netflix (NFLX.O), saying that they use a huge part of the internet traffic.

""We also need to review whether the regulation is adapted with the 'GAFAs' (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon) for example, which use bandwidth (provided by) telecom operators,"" Breton told reporters, speaking in French.

GAFA is the French acronym to designate the biggest U.S. tech firms, including Netflix.

Breton said that this particular issue, or so-called potential ""fair share"" of U.S. tech companies in the financing of the European telecoms and internet infrastructure, will be part of a wide consultation that will entail metaverse -- the shared virtual world environments which people can access via the internet.

ETNO, Europe's lobby for telecoms operators, said in a report in May that more than half of the global network traffic is attributable to six firms: Google, Facebook, Netflix, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.

These firms have argued that the introduction of any new financial contribution would challenge ""net neutrality"", or the principle that internet service providers should enable access to all content and applications regardless of their source.

Internet providers, on their part, have said these companies have conflicting interests by providing competitive services such as voice services and TV and by exploiting their network, acting as free riders.

Breton said the consultation would be launched in the first quarter of 2023 and take five to six months. The EU Commission's proposals will follow, he said.

Nine lawmakers at the European Parliament have drafted a letter to be sent to Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen, Breton and EU digital chief Margrethe Vestager urging them to ensure that companies generating the largest traffic on network infrastructure should contribute in a fair and proportionate manner to the costs.

The lawmakers, who include Andreas Schwab, Stephanie Yon-Courtin and Paul Tang, also said new measures should be consistent with the principles of the Open Internet Regulation, referring to the bloc's net neutrality rules ensuring that internet service providers (ISPs) can't block or throttle traffic to give priority to some services.

""This fairer contribution should not be discriminatory against specific companies, but reflect the role and impact of those generating the most traffic in the network,"" they said in the letter seen by Reuters.

NEW DELHI, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Indian conglomerate Tata Group is in talks with Taiwanese supplier Wistron Corp (3231.TW) to establish a joint venture to assemble Apple's (AAPL.O) iPhones in India, Bloomberg News reported on Friday.

The venture would be the Indian salt-to-software group's latest push into technology manufacturing as it taps Wistron's expertise in product development, supply chain and assembly, Bloomberg added, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

Cupertino, California-headquartered Apple has bet big on India since it began iPhone assembly in the country in 2017 via Wistron and later with Foxconn (2317.TW), in line with the Indian government's push for local manufacturing.

It wasn't immediately clear if Apple was aware of the talks, the report said.

The plan could result in the Tata group buying equity in Wistron's India operations or the two companies building a new assembly plant, or executing both those moves, the report added.

Although details of the deal are not finalised, Tatas could end up with a share of Wistron's manufacturing business beyond smartphones as well, Bloomberg said.

Apple, Tata Group and Wistron did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

MEXICO CITY, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google are facing a probe over anti-competitive practices in Mexico after the country's former telecommunications chief filed a complaint, he said in a statement on Twitter on Friday.

The complaint was brought to Mexico's telecommunications regulator IFT yesterday by Mony de Swaan Addati, who once headed the former telecommunications federation that was later replaced by IFT.

His complaint accuses Apple and Google of ""completely inhibit(ing) competition"" by ""taking advantage of their monopoly in app stores to tie use of their own payment processing systems for in-app purchases.""

In his online statement, de Swaan Addati said Google's Play store and Apple's store charge 15%-20% commission, forcing price inflation.

Google declined to comment. Apple and the IFT were not immediately available for comment.

A wave of lawsuits and complaints challenging the pair's app store rules in various countries over recent years has led Google to lower fees and Apple to loosen rules, but some app developers and other critics say more changes are needed.

De Swaan Addati added that Mexico's competition regulator had declined his request to open an investigation into the companies, prompting him to take his case to the IFT.

""I have full confidence that (the IFT) will investigate and exercise its powers - in line with international best practices - so that these companies stop abusing their market power to the detriment of developers and consumers,"" he said.

According to data firm Statista, over 30 million smartphones were forecast to be sold in Mexico last year.

Google's Android has the largest market share in Mexico with 77% penetration, according to the latest data from Statcounter.

Apple is facing scrutiny elsewhere in the region, with Brazilian regulators having banned the sale of iPhones without a charger earlier this week. read more .

411,864,APPLE,2022-09-13,Taiwan's GlobalWafers sees Nov groundbreaking for $5 billion Texas plant,"













TAIPEI, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Taiwan's GlobalWafers Co Ltd (6488.TWO) expects to start construction in November of its new $5 billion plant in Texas, the company's chairwoman and CEO said on Tuesday.

The company said in June it would build the plant to make 300-millimetre silicon wafers used in semiconductors, switching from a defunct plan to invest in Germany. read more

Chairwoman and chief executive Doris Hsu told reporters in Taipei that the groundbreaking ceremony was expected to be around the end of November.

The United States has been encouraging foreign tech firms to manufacture in the country, and the government has welcomed the investment by GlobalWafers.

Last month, U.S. President Joe Biden signed into law the Chips and Science Act, which authorized about $52 billion in government subsidies for U.S. semiconductor production and research, and an investment tax credit for chip plants estimated to be worth $24 billion.

Hsu said that subsidies, while important, were not the only consideration.

""We received government subsidy proposals from not only the United States but from other places as well. But our assessment looks at the overall score. The Chips Act is a very important factor but it is not the only factor,"" Hsu said.

""I think the U.S. market lacks silicon wafers. When we discuss carbon footprints, localization, and green solutions, I think there needs to be a local solution.""

GlobalWafer's investment will be the first silicon wafer facility to be built in the United States in more than two decades, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) (2330.TW), a major Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier and the world's largest contract chipmaker, last year started construction of a semiconductor factory in Arizona on which it plans to spend $12 billion.

GlobalWafers' Taipei-listed shares closed 1% lower on Tuesday, underpeforming the broader market (.TWII), which ended up 0.6%. The company's shares are down 48% so far this year.

OAKLAND, Calif., Sept 14 (Reuters) - Arm Ltd, the British chip technology firm owned by SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), on Wednesday launched its next generation of data center chip technology called Neoverse V2 to meet the explosive growth of data from 5G and internet-connected gadgets.

Arm creates underlying intellectual property that other firms such as Qualcomm or Apple then license to create their own processor chips. Arm's technology powers most mobile phones, but it has been making a big push into data center processors where Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) have long dominated.

Arm said companies like Ampere, Amazon, Fujitsu and Alibaba already develop processor chips based on Arm technology for their data centers. It said Neoverse V2 increases power efficiency, although it declined to provide specific numbers.

""Our partners are taking this and building very efficient solutions to target the problem spaces that they're going after,"" Dermot O'Driscoll, Arm's vice president for product solutions, said during a Q&A session about the new product. ""So we do expect to see some pretty compelling data points going from V1 to V2.""

Arm said that chip giant Nvidia Corp's (NVDA.O) latest data center processor Grace is built using the Neoverse V2 design.

416,749,APPLE,2022-09-14,"Google loses challenge against EU antitrust decision, other probes loom","













LUXEMBOURG, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Google suffered one of its biggest setbacks on Wednesday when a top European court upheld a ruling that it broke competition rules and fined it a record 4.1 billion euros, in a move that may encourage other regulators to ratchet up pressure on the U.S. giant.

The unit of U.S. tech giant Alphabet (GOOGL.O) had challenged an EU antitrust ruling, but the decision was broadly upheld by Europe's General Court, with the fine trimmed modestly to 4.125 billion euros ($4.13 billion) from 4.34 billion euros.

Even with the reduction, it was still a record fine for an antitrust violation. The EU antitrust enforcer has fined the world's most popular internet search engine a total of 8.25 billion euros in three investigations stretching back more than a decade.

The judgment is set to boost landmark rules aimed at curbing the power of U.S. tech giants that will go into effect next year. read more

""The judgment strengthens the hand of the Commission. It confirms the Commission can use antitrust proceedings as a backstop threat to enforce rapid compliance with digital regulation also known as the DMA,"" said Nicolas Petit, professor at European University Institute.

EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager did not mince her words.

""This, of course, is really good. Now, we have the second Google judgment and for us, it is really important as it backs our enforcement efforts,"" she said.

This is the second court defeat for Google which lost its challenge to a 2.42 billion euro ($2.42 billion) fine last year, the first of a trio of cases.

""The General Court largely confirms the Commission's decision that Google imposed unlawful restrictions on manufacturers of Android mobile devices and mobile network operators in order to consolidate the dominant position of its search engine,"" the court said.

""In order better to reflect the gravity and duration of the infringement, the General Court considers it appropriate however to impose a fine of 4.125 billion euros on Google, its reasoning differing in certain respects from that of the Commission,"" judges said.

Google, which can appeal on matters of law to the EU Court of Justice, Europe's highest, voiced its disappointment.

""We are disappointed that the Court did not annul the decision in full. Android has created more choice for everyone, not less, and supports thousands of successful businesses in Europe and around the world,"" a spokesperson said.

ANTITRUST BOOST

The ruling is a boost for Vestager after the General Court overturned her decisions against Intel (INTC.O) and Qualcomm (QCOM.O) earlier this year.

Vestager has made her crackdown against Big Tech a hallmark of her job, a move which has encouraged regulators in the United States and elsewhere to follow suit.

She is currently investigating Google's digital advertising business, its Jedi Blue ad deal with Meta (META.O), Apple's (AAPL.O) App Store rules, Meta's marketplace and data use and Amazon's (AMZN.O) online selling and market practices.

The Court agreed with the Commission's assessment that iPhone maker Apple (AAPL.O) was not in the same market and therefore could not be a competitive constraint against Android.

The court backing could reinforce the EU antitrust watchdog in its investigations into Apple's business practices in the music streaming market, which the regulator says Apple dominates.

FairSearch, whose 2013 complaint triggered the EU case, said the judgment may lead to more competition in the smartphone market.

""This shows the European Commission got it right. Google can no longer impose its will on phone makers. Now they may open their devices to competition in search and other services, allowing consumers to benefit from increased choice,"" its lawyer Thomas Vinje said.

The Commission in its 2018 decision said Google used Android to cement its dominance in general internet search via payments to large manufacturers and mobile network operators and restrictions.

Google said it acted like countless other businesses and that such payments and agreements help keep Android a free operating system, criticising the EU decision as out of step with the economic reality of mobile software platforms.

The case is T-604/18 Google vs European Commission.

TAIPEI, Sept 14 (Reuters) - The United States will hold talks with Taiwan next month to discuss new U.S. legislation designed to boost the American semiconductor industry, the top U.S. diplomat in Taipei said on Wednesday.

Last month, U.S. President Joe Biden signed into law the Chips and Science Act, which authorised about $52 billion in government subsidies for U.S. semiconductor production and research, as well as an investment tax credit for chip plants estimated to be worth $24 billion.

The United States has been encouraging foreign tech firms to manufacture in the country, and the government has welcomed investments by Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW) and GlobalWafers Co (6488.TWO). read more

Sandra Oudkirk, director of the American Institute in Taiwan, told an industry forum that the US-Taiwan Technology Trade and Investment Collaboration framework, or TTIC, has helped elevate and prioritise U.S.-Taiwan economic engagements.

""The TTIC is a powerful platform which we are already using to address challenges in the semiconductor space, such as critical chip shortages which adversely affect multiple industry sectors,"" she said of the framework, which was launched last year.

The next ""engagement"" under the framework will happen in Washington from Oct. 12-14, she added.

""At this event, we plan to host a roundtable discussion to share more on how the Chips and Science Act will be implemented in the United States,"" Oudkirk said, without elaborating.

""In addition to Taiwan investments in hardware and technology via the incentives provided by the Chips and Science Act, the United States seeks Taiwan's industry's continued support as we connect talent here and the innovative ecosystem here to the United States and other like-minded partners.""

Taiwan has been keen to show the United States, its most important international backer and arms supplier despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties, that it is a reliable friend as a global chip crunch continues to impact auto production and consumer electronics.

418,83,APPLE,2022-09-14,Apple wants appeals court bailout in privilege dispute over Tim Cook emails,"













(Reuters) - A fascinating, albeit grammatically hair-splitting, question of attorney-client privilege has reared up in a shareholder class action against Apple Inc.

In late 2018, as Apple mulled whether to tell shareholders that its earnings guidance was off by billions of dollars, CEO Tim Cook sent an email to Apple CFO Luca Maestri and general counsel Katherine Adams, asking for their views on a presentation Cook was going to make to the company’s board of directors. Maestri and Adams responded with their advice, according to a federal magistrate's report and subsequent filings in the class action.

Not long after the email exchanges, Apple issued an extremely rare “letter to investors,” advising that Apple’s original estimate for revenues in the first quarter of 2019 was way off. The company had announced a projection of between $89 and $93 billion for the quarter. But Cook's Jan. 2, 2019, letter to investors said Apple’s new guidance was for revenues of about $84 billion. Cook’s missive attributed the shortfall to “economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China.”

Apple’s share price fell from $157.92 to $142.19 after the disclosure. Predictably, shareholders sued, pointing, among other things, to a statement Cook made during a phone call with analysts in November 2018. When Cook was asked about declining prospects in emerging markets, the CEO acknowledged problems in some countries. But he specifically excluded China as a trouble spot. ""Our business in China was very strong last quarter,” Cook assured analysts.

Cook's statement is at the heart of the securities class action under way before U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of Oakland. In November 2020, Rogers ruled that investors, represented by Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, could proceed with their claim that Cook’s statement about Apple’s business in China was fraudulent. Last February, Rogers certified a class of Apple shareholders.

The case has sped along. Apple’s lawyers at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe moved for summary judgment earlier this month, arguing that no reasonable jury could find Cook’s statement to be false or made with fraudulent intent. Shareholders, meanwhile, moved to exclude Apple’s experts and to file an amended complaint to include information they obtained in discovery from the company.

But now Apple wants to pause the class action for an interlocutory appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Its rationale: Rogers erred when she upheld a magistrate judge’s order requiring Apple to turn over purportedly privileged documents, including — most notably, based on Apple’s brief — the email Cook sent to his CFO and GC in advance of the board meeting that presumably prompted the company to issue its revised revenue guidance in January 2019.

Apple insists its bid for 9th Circuit review is a matter of principle. A year ago, as I've reported, the 9th Circuit ruled in In re Grand Jury that attorney-client privilege does not protect documents whose primary purpose is to seek or provide business advice, even if the documents also anticipate litigation. The 9th Circuit said its test aligned with decisions from the 2nd, 5th and 6th Circuits, although the anonymous company and law firm that sought to shield their communications in the Grand Jury case subsequently told the U.S. Supreme Court, in a petition for review last April, that the 9th Circuit test is “incompatible” with holdings from the 7th and D.C. Circuits. (The justices are scheduled to consider the petition later this month.)

The 9th Circuit’s Grand Jury decision left open a question about whether privilege shields documents that have both a business and legal purpose if legal advice is a primary purpose of the communication but not necessarily the only primary purpose. The D.C. Circuit held in 2014’s In re Kellogg Brown & Root Inc that privilege applies when legal advice is a primary purpose for the document, but the 9th Circuit said in Grand Jury that it did not need to decide whether to adopt that more expansive view of privilege based on the facts of the case.

Apple has homed in on this unresolved point — a question, when you boil it down, about whether privilege applies whenever business advice is “a” primary purpose for communications or only when business considerations are “the” primary purpose.

Apple told Rogers that uncertainty about the 9th Circuit test has left companies in a bind. (The U.S. Chamber of Commerce advanced similar arguments to the Supreme Court in an amicus brief calling on the justices to review the 9th Circuit’s Grand Jury ruling.) “A CEO should be able to seek privileged legal advice from his general counsel without needing to spell out a precise ‘legal concern,’ even when the same email additionally requests feedback from other executives,” Apple said in an Aug. 5 brief arguing that U.S. Magistrate Joseph Spero should not have ordered the disclosure of Cook’s email to Maestri and Adams.

Rogers was notably unswayed in her terse Sept. 12 ruling confirming the magistrate’s order directing Apple to turn over the Cook email and other documents. The D.C. Circuit’s Kellogg test, Rogers wrote, is not the standard in the 9th Circuit, so Spero obviously did not err in applying the narrower Grand Jury standard.

Apple told Rogers in its brief requesting certification of an interlocutory appeal that its case is an opportunity for the 9th Circuit to clarify an important and unsettled legal question. It also insisted that the appeal will advance the securities class action (despite the late stage of the litigation) by determining whether shareholders are, as the magistrate ruled, entitled to additional discovery.

I’d love to know exactly what’s in the 2018 email from Cook to his top advisors, but Apple lead counsel, James Kramer of Orrick, declined to provide a statement on the privilege dispute. Robbins Geller’s Shawn Williams also declined. The shareholder firm pointed out in its brief urging Rogers to uphold the magistrate’s order that Spero actually reviewed the disputed document — and he determined that it is not shielded by privilege.

As of mid-afternoon on Wednesday, Rogers — who ordered Apple on Monday to turn over the documents specified in the magistrate’s order by today — has not responded to the company’s pitch for a 9th Circuit appeal.

Sept 15 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) have both passed on the media rights to the LIV Golf tournament, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Critics have said that LIV Golf, backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, amounts to ""sportswashing"" by a nation trying to improve its reputation in the face of criticism over its human rights record.

420,44,APPLE,2022-09-16,U.S. antitrust officials ask to join arguments in Apple appeal,"













Sept 16 (Reuters) - Officials from the U.S. Department of Justice have asked to take part in oral arguments next month in ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games' appeal of a court loss against Apple Inc (AAPL.O), according to court documents filed Friday.

Epic sued Apple in 2020 claiming that the iPhone maker violated antitrust laws with its App Store rules, which require developers to pay commissions to Apple of up to 30% of in-app purchases. Apple emerged mostly victorious, allowing its commissions to stand. At the time of the trial, antitrust experts had said that loss for Epic could close off legal avenues for the Justice Department, which has been probing Apple since 2019, to bring an antitrust complaint.

Epic appealed its loss, with oral arguments set for Oct. 21 at the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where both Apple and Epic will have 20 minutes each to make their respective cases.

In January, the Justice Department entered the case by filing a brief. Antitrust officials said they did not support either side in the disputes at hand but were concerned that the lower court's ruling had improperly interpreted the Sherman Act, the country's primary antitrust law. On Friday, U.S. officials asked for 10 minutes of argument time.

""The United States believes that its participation at oral argument would be helpful to the court, especially in explaining how the errors (in antitrust law interpretation) could significantly harm antitrust enforcement beyond the specific context of this case,"" the Justice Department wrote in the filing.

Neither Epic nor Apple opposed the move, though Apple wants the regulators' argument time to come out of Epic's time or to be granted additional time.

421,314,APPLE,2022-09-19,"Cracked iPhone back glass? Some new models much easier to fix, firm finds","













Sept 19 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) new iPhone 14 base model looks similar to its predecessor but is redesigned on the inside, making it much easier to repair cracks in the back glass, repair firm iFixit said in blog post Monday.

Glass backs returned to iPhones in 2017, but the way they were attached made them difficult to replace. Apple charged up to $599 to repair the back glass on some models, though much less for customers with AppleCare+, Apple's device insurance program.

IFixit, which assesses the reparability of consumer electronics, said on Monday Apple has made major changes to the iPhone 14 base model. Previous iPhones had back glass glued to the phone's frame and buried under other components, meaning the device had to be almost totally disassembled to fix it.

In the iPhone 14, the back glass is held in place by just two screws one connector, making it easy to remove.

Apple did not mention the internal redesign when it announced the iPhone 14 earlier this month. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Given the cost of previous repairs ""everyone was just living with phones with tape on the back,"" iFixit Chief Executive Kyle Wiens told Reuters. ""This gives people a shot at getting them fixed. It also creates opportunities for local repair shops.""

The costlier iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max still have the older style of glued-in glass back. Apple's phones have long been a target of repair industry critics who argued the devices were so hard to fix that consumers were more likely to discard them and buy a new device.

Apple has slowly started to embrace the repair industry in recent years as part of its environmental sustainability efforts. In 2019, Apple started selling tools, parts and manuals to independent repair shops. Last year, Apple began offering those items to the general public.

422,561,APPLE,2022-09-19,Taiwan August export orders likely contract as demand eases: Reuters poll,"Summary

Summary Companies For poll data click:

Orders median forecast -2% y/y (prior month -1.9%)

Data due Tuesday, Sept 20, 4:00 p.m. (0800 GMT)















TAIPEI, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Taiwan's export orders likely contracted for a second straight month in August, and at a similar pace from the previous month as global demand cools, a Reuters poll showed on Monday.

The median forecast from a poll of 13 economists was for export orders to fall 2% from a year earlier. Forecasts ranged from an expansion of 3.4% to a contraction of 3.7%.

The island's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, unexpectedly fell in July. Orders shrank 1.9% to $54.26 billion from a year-ago period, taking a larger-than-expected hit from weakening demand for technology and continued economic troubles in its largest market China.

The government has predicted last month's orders to be between 0.9% and 3.7% lower than those of August 2021.

Taiwan's export orders are a leading indicator of demand for hi-tech gadgets and Asian exports, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months.

The island's manufacturers, including the world's largest contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW), are a key part of the global supply chain for technology giants including Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

423,150,APPLE,2022-09-20,"Apple to raise App Store prices in some countries in Europe, Asia","













Sept 20 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) said on Tuesday it will raise prices of apps and in-app purchases on its App Store from next month in all of the euro zone and some countries in Asia and South America.

The new prices, excluding auto-renewable subscriptions, will be effective as early as Oct. 5, Apple said in a blog post.

The U.S. tech giant periodically adjusts its prices in different regions and reduced prices for euro zone countries last year to adjust for currencies and taxes, dropping starting prices for many apps to 99 euro cents from 1.09 euros.

The latest price rise increases those starting prices to 1.19 euros.

A rapid rise in inflation, interest rates and energy prices this year has hammered the yen, the euro and most emerging economy currencies. The euro has dropped to two-decade lows this year and has been languishing around parity against the dollar for weeks.

Apart from euro zone countries, the price increases will hit Sweden and Poland in Europe; Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, South Korea and Vietnam in Asia; and Chile in South America.

For some countries like Vietnam, the price increase was due to new regulations relating to collecting tax from consumers, Apple said.

Apple, which launched its latest generation of iPhones earlier this month, has been developing its services business to reduce dependency on its mainstay smartphones.

Revenue from Apple's services business, which includes the App Store, has been growing at a rapid pace in the last few years and now hovers around $20 billion per quarter.

424,636,APPLE,2022-09-20,Samsung climate inertia is by-product of Seoul's,"













HONG KONG, Sept 20 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Seoul's foot-dragging on climate change is holding back Korea Inc. Last week the country's top conglomerate, Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), unveiled an underwhelming net-zero carbon emissions target. Blame South Korea's power-market monopoly and regressive renewables policies.

The world's largest chip and mobile-phone maker lags on decarbonisation. Apple (AAPL.O), both a rival and a customer, intends to achieve carbon neutrality for its supply chain and products by 2030; Japan's Sony (6758.T) and TSMC (2330.TW) in Taiwan recently committed to the same goal by 2040 and 2050 respectively. The $274 billion South Korean group is only targeting emissions from its own operations - and by 2050, a decade later than Intel's (INTC.O) similar pledge.

It's not entirely Samsung's fault. Its semiconductor and components business accounted for 90% of the company’s 17.4 million tonnes of greenhouse gases emitted last year. Most of that is probably from electricity for factories in South Korea, where renewable power is scarce. Solar and wind generated just 26.9 terawatt hours of electricity in 2021, a paltry 4.7% of the total and roughly equivalent to Samsung’s needs.

One culprit is government-backed Korea Electric Power Corporation, or Kepco, which dominates power generation, transmission and distribution. Despite years of shareholder pressure, the $9 billion utility remains addicted to fossil fuels, which made up over 70% of its total capacity as of June. Some of its power-generating units are even slashing renewable investments, the Korea Times reports, as first-half losses at Kepco balloon to a whopping $7.7 billion.

The government this year started allowing firms to buy from renewable-energy producers via direct power purchase agreements. Cutting out Kepco is a good step, but companies still must pay the utility incidental and network costs; these can total as much as 45% of current electricity prices, according to environmental group Solutions for Our Climate. Red tape around securing renewable project approvals has also pushed up prices.

As the country's top exporter, Samsung should be in a strong position to lobby for change. The company warned that if it does not meet its corporate customers' demands of using 100% renewable energy, some 25.8 trillion won ($18.5 billion), or a fifth of business-to-business sales, based on 2020 results, are at risk. Yet President Yoon Suk-yeol's administration plans to lower its renewable-energy target for 2030, favouring nuclear power instead. Samsung's corporate heft will be put to test.

CONTEXT NEWS

South Korea's Samsung Electronics on Sept. 15 announced a new environmental strategy that includes a commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions in its own operations by 2050. As part of the initiative, it will invest over 7 trillion won ($5 billion) by 2030 in technology that it hopes, for example, will filter out greenhouse gases and capture carbon dioxide generated during chip production.

The company has also joined RE100, a group of global corporations including Apple, Intel and TSMC that are committed to using 100% renewable energy across their own operations.

Separately, South Korea's government wants to lower its renewable energy target for 2030, according to a draft electricity demand and supply plan from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy on Aug. 30. Renewable energy will account for 21.5% of generation capacity by 2030, down from the previous target of 30.2%.

425,277,APPLE,2022-09-20,"Apple helps Taiwan export orders resume growth in August, outlook mixed","Summary

Summary Companies August export orders +2% y/y vs -2% poll forecast

Export orders from China -25.5% y/y vs -22.6% in July

Ministry sees Sept orders between -7% and -9.4% y/y

Ministry sees mixed outlook















TAIPEI, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Taiwan's export orders unexpectedly expanded in August on strong demand for technology and new consumer electronics product launches like iPhones even as the island's largest market China faced continued headwinds.

But the government said the outlook was mixed due to a series of uncertainties including high global inflation, increasing geopolitical risks and new COVID-19 strains.

Export orders, a bellwether for global technology demand, grew 2% in August from a year earlier to $54.59 billion, a record high for the month,said the Ministry of Economic Affairs on Tuesday. Analysts had expected a drop of 2%.

August's rise followed a 1.9% annual contraction in July.

Orders for telecommunications products rose 3.1% in August from a year ago due mostly to cellphone orders, the ministry said. Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which many Taiwanese firms make components for, put its latest iPhones on sale this month. read more

Orders for electronic products jumped 15.4%, driven by semiconductor demand for high-end computing, automobiles and stockpiling for new consumer electronics, the ministry said.

Kevin Wang, an economist at Taishin Securities Investment Advisory Co, said while the ""pulling in"" of Apple orders was a boon, the rest of 2022 may not be as good, coming off a high base from last year and with increased downside risks in China and Europe in particular.

A trend of working and studying from home that started during the COVID-19 pandemic has fuelled a growth in orders for Taiwanese electronics for more than two years. More recently, a global semiconductor shortage has also filled Taiwanese chipmakers' order books.

The ministry said it expected this month's export orders to be between 7% and 9.4% lower than those of September 2021.

It said that even with all the uncertainty, new consumer electronics products from ""various international brands"", as well as demand for high-end computing, 5G and automotive electronics, would help export orders remain stable going forward.

Taiwanese companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW) are major suppliers to Apple, Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and other global tech firms.

Taiwan's August orders from China fell 25.5% from a year earlier, compared with an annual fall of 22.6% in July. Month-on-month, orders from China edged down 0.1%.

China's economy narrowly escaped contraction last quarter due to widespread COVID-19 lockdowns, and economists say its nascent recovery is in danger of fizzling out amid fresh virus flare-ups and a deep crisis in the property sector.

Taiwan's orders from the United States rose 7.5% on a year before, a healthier pace compared with the previous month's 6.9% rise.

Export orders from Europe rose 14.6%, versus an annual contraction of 5.1% in July, while those from Japan rose 2.2%.

426,752,APPLE,2022-09-21,Italian fruit farmers use hill caves to help cut energy bills,"













PREDAIA, Italy, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Apple farmers in the north of Italy are using natural refrigerators carved under a hillside to store their harvest in a controlled environment that remains at a constant temperature in all seasons.

Three hundred metres beneath their fruit orchards in Predaia, a small town in the Trentino region, the Melinda group has created 34 refrigeration areas in vast caves, where they are able to keep 12-13% of their produce and cut their energy costs.

Inside the refrigerated areas of the caves, the apples are stored in stacked up plastic boxes and moved around by workers in safety helmets operating fork-lift trucks.

""On an environmental impact level, we have seen more advantages and returns,"" said Mauro Erlicher, manager of the underground plant.

""One of them is definitely in terms of energy levels, because from a test done last year...we measured a 32% saving of electricity in the cave.""

The caves currently store around 30,000 tonnes of apples, a figure expected to increase to 40,000 tonnes in the near future.

Erlicher explained how large refrigeration storage chambers above ground use a “sandwich panel” insulated with polyurethane and sheets of metal to keep the inside cool.

In the underground caves, the rocks act as the ""sandwich panel"", so it is ""as natural as possible""

Before the caves can be used, the rocks are cooled with a gas to a depth of 5-7 metres (16.5-23 feet) which means they then maintain a constant temperature of 1 degree Celsius (34 Fahrenheit).

As summer comes to an end above ground, the harvest has begun and farmers are at work picking apples from orchards, which will continue for 30-40 days.

One of the farmers, Loris Calliari, said they were sceptical when they first heard of the cave idea, but were quickly won over by the results.

""We were hesitant at first, then we realised that it works, because there is a good saving of energy, and it is very sustainable. We hope to be able to keep going with our project.""

427,845,APPLE,2022-09-21,France's Deezer pledges to turn a profit by 2025,"













PARIS, Sept 21 (Reuters) - French music streaming platform Deezer (DEEZR.PA)'s first-half adjusted gross profit rose 9.1% from a year earlier, led by a surge in sales in its home country that firmed up its goal to turn a profit by 2025, the company said on Wednesday.

The group, once championed in France as being one of the first and most promising so-called unicorns, companies valued at 1 billion euros or more, is striving to convince investors of its capacity to turn a profit by 2025 by focusing on key markets such as France, Brazil and Germany, and new services.

Gross profit increased to 45 million euros ($44.4 million) from 42 million a year earlier, while total sales rose by 12% over the period to 219 million euros, Deezer said in a statement.

This was mainly due to a gain in the average revenue per user (ARPU), which jumped by 12.4% to 3.9 euros. Deezer's number of direct subscribers in France, where it generates about 60% of its consolidated revenue, rose to 3.3 million from 3 million a year earlier.

Yet the total number of subscribers fell by close to 3% to 9.4 million.

""By focusing our business on large attractive markets and entering new markets with a partnership-led model, we are convinced we can capture a fair share of the booming streaming market and continue improving our profitability to reach breakeven by 2025,"" Chief Executive Officer Jeronimo Folgueira said.

Suffering from comparison to bigger rivals such as Spotify (SPOT.N) and Apple Music (AAPL.O), Deezer hasn't yet recovered from its painful debut on Euronext's Paris stock exchange in July, which saw its shares plummet by 35% in the first few hours after its listing. read more

The stock has lost 65% of its value since its first trading day, valuing the company at 472 million euros ($466.38 million), compared to Spotify's market capitalisation of $18.7 billion.

428,171,APPLE,2022-09-21,Apple may move a quarter of iPhone production to India by 2025 -JPM,"













Sept 21 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) may make one out of four iPhones in India by 2025, J.P.Morgan analysts said on Wednesday, as the tech giant moves some production away from China, amid mounting geopolitical tensions and strict COVID-19 lockdowns in the country.

The brokerage expects Apple to move about 5% of iPhone 14 production from late 2022 to India, which is the world's second-biggest smartphone market after China.

It is also estimating about 25% of all Apple products, including Mac, iPad, Apple Watch and AirPods, to be manufactured outside China by 2025 from 5% currently.

Cupertino, California-headquartered Apple has bet big on India since it began iPhone assembly in the country in 2017 via Wistron (3231.TW) and later with Foxconn (2317.TW), in line with the Indian government's push for local manufacturing.

The pandemic hampered supply chain relocation plans for businesses, but with restrictions easing, more companies, including Apple, are reaccelerating these efforts this year.

""Taiwanese vendors such as Hon Hai and Pegatron play a key role in the relocation to India. In the medium to long term, we also expect Apple to qualify local India manufacturing suppliers,"" according to J.P.Morgan analysts led by Gokul Hariharan, who is rated 4 out of 5 for estimates accuracy.

A Bloomberg report said earlier this month that Indian conglomerate Tata Group was in talks with Wistron to establish a joint venture to assemble iPhones in the country amid Apple's plans to cut production lag with China. [nL1N30G096] read more

Sept 22 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co (F.N) on Thursday announced a management shuffle and the streamlining of its product development and supply chain units, days after flagging a likely inventory build up of up to 45,000 cars that may lack certain parts.

The automaker said Chief Financial Officer John Lawler would take on the additional responsibility of overseeing the makeover of its global supply chain operations until it names a new supply chain chief.

The global auto industry is undergoing rapid transformation as focus shifts to electric vehicles from those powered by gasoline, driving companies such as Ford and General Motors Co (GM.N) to commit big investments, while redrawing their strategies to compete in the fast-emerging market.

Earlier this year, Ford said its electric vehicle and internal-combustion engine units would be run as separate entities, in a move aimed at supercharging its EV business. read more

To bolster its efforts in ramping up the development of electric vehicles, Ford said it was naming Doug Field as chief advanced product development and technology officer.

In the expanded role, Field will oversee EV products, software and digital systems development, and advanced driver assistance, Ford said.

Field, who formerly headed Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) car project, was poached by the automaker last year to lead its efforts in advanced technology and embedded systems.

""Developing and scaling the next generation of electric and software-defined vehicles requires a different focus and mix of talent ...,"" Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley said in a statement.

The company also said it was hiring former employees of HP Inc (HPQ.N) and Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O) to support its push to develop fully connected, software defined vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems.

Sept 22 (Reuters) - The National Football League has reached a multiyear deal with Apple Music to sponsor the Super Bowl Halftime Show, beginning with the American football championship game in February 2023, the league said on Thursday.

The Super Bowl is usually the most watched television event of the year in the United States, and the halftime show has become a showcase, featuring such notable artists as The Weeknd, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira, Beyoncé, Justin Timberlake, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Bruno Mars, Prince and Madonna.

Over 120 million viewers watched the 2022 Super Bowl LVI Halftime Show, which featured Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar. Super Bowl LVII will be played on Sunday, Feb. 12, in Glendale, Ariz.

The tie up will be a key promotional platform for Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which has been associated with music since 2001, when it introduced the iPod digital music player.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Apple is among a number of companies bidding to become the next home for the NFL Sunday Ticket, a package that lets fans watch every Sunday football game, according to sources familiar with the matter. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.

Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY Sports















Sept 23 (Reuters) - New York Attorney General Letitia James has asked Major League Baseball and Apple to allow Friday's Yankees game, in which Aaron Judge will look to tie the AL home run record, to be aired on the team-owned YES Network.

As it stands, the only way to watch the broadcast of the game against the visiting Boston Red Sox is on streaming service Apple TV+.

""History is in the making as Aaron Judge electrifies Yankees fans, and everyone who loves baseball,"" James said in a release.

""To deny millions of New Yorkers, and fans around the nation, the opportunity to watch as Aaron Judge steps up to the plate, is wrong and unfair,"" she said.

""That is why I am calling on Apple and the MLB to reach a fair accommodation with the YES Network so that fans can watch what we all hope will be history made this evening.""

YES primarily serves New York City and the surrounding areas.

An MLB spokesman did not have any immediate comment on the request but in a news release this week about the Yankees broadcast schedule, MLB noted that ""Friday Night Baseball"" on Apple TV+ is free and available to anyone with internet access across devices where Apple TV+ can be found.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Judge hit his Major League-leading 60th home run on Tuesday, tying the mark set by Yankees great Babe Ruth, and is now one big swing shy of Roger Maris's 61-year-old American League record for home runs in a single season.

Sept 23 (Reuters) - German battery maker Varta's (VAR1.DE) shares shed nearly a fifth of their value after it withdrew full-year and third-quarter forecasts on Friday, citing higher than expected energy and raw material costs.

The company, which produces automotive batteries as well as headphone batteries for the likes of Apple (AAPL.O) among others, said it envisaged only limited possibility of cost increases being passed on to customers.

It added that delays in two large orders with original equipment manufacturers meant it might not be able to deliver significant volumes this year.

The company had already cut its full-year outlook at the end of July, when it forecast revenue in a range of 880 million to 920 million euros ($858.4 million to 897.4 million) and adjusted core earnings of 200 million to 225 million euros for the year.

At that time it had expected third-quarter revenue between 210 million and 230 million euros, with adjusted core profit of 40 million to 50 million euros.

The stock was down 19% at 1125GMT, set for its biggest daily fall in almost three years. The shares lost 10% in early trade before the announcement.

Summary

Summary Companies India wants local GPS rival in smartphones; industry fears costs

Smartphone players want delay to New Delhi's Jan. 2023 deadline

Samsung, others say Indian system needs hardware changes-sources

Boosting native system part of Modi's self-reliance campaign















NEW DELHI, Sept 26 (Reuters) - India is pushing tech giants to make smartphones compatible with its home-grown navigation system within months, worrying the likes of Samsung, Xiaomi and Apple who fear elevated costs and disruptions as the move requires hardware changes, according to two industry sources and government documents seen by Reuters.

In line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's drive for self-reliance, India has over the years expanded the use of its regional navigation satellite system called NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation).

The Indian government wants to reduce dependence on foreign systems, including the widely used U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS), and says NavIC provides more accurate domestic navigation and that its use would benefit the economy.

China, the European Union, Japan and Russia have their own global or regional navigation systems to rival GPS. Operational since 2018, NavIC's uptake is minimal; it is mandated in public vehicle location trackers, for example.

But government and industry documents show Modi's administration and space officials want to broaden its use, and have this year pushed smartphone giants to make hardware changes to support NavIC, in addition to GPS, in new phones they will sell from January 2023.

In private meetings in August and September, representatives of Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Xiaomi Corp (1810.HK), Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and others pushed back, citing worries that making phones NavIC-compliant would mean higher research and production costs.

The changes would also require more testing clearances, which with a Jan. 1 deadline would disrupt businesses and planned launches, according to two smartphone industry sources and documents.

Samsung declined comment on the meetings, while Apple and Xiaomi did not respond to requests for comment. India's IT ministry and the space agency ISRO that are both involved in the project also did not respond.

Samsung in particular voiced concerns during a Sept. 2 closed-door meeting between top smartphone players and chipmakers with Indian IT ministry and space agency officials, according to the meeting's minutes reviewed by Reuters.

Samsung's India executive Binu George warned of cost worries, telling officials that NavIC support requires not just new smartphone chipsets but also many other components.

""This would add to cost as it requires hardware design changes and additional investments to support devices specific to India. Further, the companies have already prepared for models to be launched in 2024,"" the minutes quoted him as saying.

George did not respond to a request for comment.

The smartphone players have sought time until 2025 to implement the changes, and a final decision is expected in coming days, a senior government official said.

The minutes said the Indian space agency will provide technical support for implementing NavIC in new smartphones, adding another meeting may be called.

INDIA VS OTHERS

India's space agency has said systems like GPS and Russia's GLONASS are operated by their countries' defence agencies, making it possible for civilian service to be interrupted.

NavIC, it says, is fully under the control of the Indian government, which one day wants to take it global like GPS.

India would not be the first country to push smartphone makers to add support for a native navigation system.

Russia has sought to mandate inclusion of its own GLONASS system in smartphones sold locally to reduce reliance on GPS, which Washington can switch off for civilian subscribers as it did during military operations in Iraq.

China's Beidou was completed in June 2020, and, though not mandated, the official Xinhua news agency has reported that in 2021, 94.5% of China-made smartphones had Beidou support.

Xiaomi and Samsung together account for 38% of the smartphone market in India, the world's second biggest after China. Apple's more expensive smartphones have a roughly 3% share in India, data from Hong Kong-based research firm Counterpoint shows.

Other Chinese manufactures making up a further 28% of the market were also present at the Sept. 2 meeting, government minutes show. China's Realme, which has a 16% market share, did not attend, and neither did smaller manufacturers.

Apple's website says it already supports the five global and regional navigation networks including GPS, GLONASS and BeiDou in current iPhones. The Indian directive could force it to add a new one.

A key concern for players like Samsung and Xiaomi remains the higher cost of so-called dual band chipsets they would need to support both GPS and NavIC, as these companies are leaders in the sub-$200 category in India's price-sensitive market, the smartphone industry sources said.

CHIPSET CONCERN

For procuring NavIC-compliant chipsets, most smartphone makers are reliant on global giants such as U.S. chip designer Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and Taiwan's MediaTek Inc (2454.TW).

Voluntary use of such chipsets has been limited in India as phone manufacturers remain hesitant to add the extra components - and cost - required to make it work, said Parv Sharma, senior semiconducter analyst at Counterpoint.

India's space agency said that by mid-2021, only about two dozen mobile handset models in India had NavIC capability. In total there are around 300, Counterpoint has said.

During the Sept. 2 meeting, MediaTek said all of the company's chipsets for 5G phones would support NavIC, with ""some cost enhancement"" and additional hardware. MediaTek added that it expected about 80% of mobile phones to be 5G-enabled in two years.

MediaTek declined to comment on Reuters queries. Qualcomm in a statement said it has been working with the Indian space agency to enable NavIC on its chipsets for years and will continue to do so.

Another lobbying push from smartphone players is to convince the Indian government to make NavIC available on the so-called L1 satellite frequency which is already used by GPS, and not onlyon the L5 frequency used by New Delhi.

That, executives say, will make it easier for manufacturers to integrate NavIC in chipsets which mostly support the L1 band the world over, curbing separate development costs for NavIC.

Indian space agency ISRO told the Sept. 2 gathering that was not immediately possible, as NavIC was likely to be available on the L1 band only by 2024-25, after more satellite launches, the meeting's record shows.

435,733,APPLE,2022-09-26,Truckloads of apples start to rot as blocked Kashmir highway halts deliveries,"













SRINAGAR, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Roadworks have halted thousands of trucks carrying millions of dollars worth of apples on Indian Kashmir's main highway, a major union leader said on Monday, triggering protests by growers as their produce begins to rot.

Highway repairs were causing massive delays along the highway that connects the disputed Kashmir valley to the rest of India, meaning huge expected losses.

""We have 8,000 trucks carrying apples worth 100 crore rupees (one billion rupees, or about $12.25 million) stranded on the highway for the last two weeks,"" Bashir Ahmad Basheer, the head of the Kashmir Valley Fruit Growers and Dealers Union, told Reuters.

Employing more than three million people, fruit cultivation is an economic lifeline for the Himalayan region, which is claimed in full but ruled in part by both India and Pakistan.

All 10 major wholesale fruit markets in the Kashmir valley were shut on Sunday and Monday as farmers protested against what they said was traffic mismanagement.

""The apples in the truck have started rotting now,"" said Rajesh Kumar, a trucker from the northern Indian state of Punjab.

""I don't know how many more days I will be here,"" he said, adding he had been stuck on the highway for six days.

The Divisional Commissioner for Kashmir said this year had seen a bumper apple crop of more than 2.1 million metric tons due to heavy rain.

""We have difficulties in the movement of traffic on the highway due to shooting stones (falling rocks) but it is beyond human control,"" Commissioner P.K. Pole told Reuters.

Repair work on the Srinagar-Jammu highway would be finished this week, a local government official told Reuters on condition of anonymity, because he was not authorised to speak to the media.

436,304,APPLE,2022-09-28,Apple's $310 mln iPhone throttling settlement must be reconsidered - court,"Summary

Summary Law firms Panel finds judge applied incorrect standard in signing off on deal

Judge also told to reconsider fee award















(Reuters) - A federal judge was ordered Wednesday to reconsider his approval of a $310 million settlement of a class action accusing Apple Inc of slowing down certain iPhones to mask performance issues, including $80.6 million in lawyers' fees.

A unanimous panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals did not express any view about whether the settlement should ultimately be approved.

However, it found that U.S. District Judge Edward Davila in San Jose, California incorrectly started with a presumption that the settlement was fair while he was considering it. Under earlier 9th Circuit precedent, the panel said, there should be no such presumption for settlements, like that in the iPhone litigation, that were reached before a court has certified a class.

The ruling partly granted objections by some class members to the deal, but overruled most objections. Lawyers for the objectors, the class and for Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The panel also ruled that Davila should reconsider his decision to count lead lawyers' hours of work in parallel mass tort litigation in California state court, which was also resolved by the settlement, when he set the $80.6 million fee. Some class members had argued that the state court work duplicated work in the federal litigation and should not be counted separately.

The 9th Circuit did not address the merits of the issue, but said that including those hours appeared to contradict another part of Davila's reasoning in setting the fee.

The settlement resolved claims in multidistrict litigation that Apple secretly slowed down, or throttled, the performance of certain iPhone operating systems in order to prevent them from shutting off unexpectedly.

In settling the case, Apple said it had ""agreed to put this matter behind it"" but did not admit wrongdoing and stood by what it called a performance management feature that ""solved a complex technological problem.""

The case is In re Apple Inc Device Performance Litigation, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-15758.

For the prevailing objectors: Kendrick Jan of Jan & Jan

For plaintiffs: Mark Molumphy of Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy

For Apple: Christopher Chorba of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher

437,623,APPLE,2022-09-28,Amazon.com unveils device that tracks breath while sleeping,"













Sept 28 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc on Wednesday announced a contactless gadget that can monitor people's sleep, along with updates to its lineup of voice-controlled devices and e-readers.

The online retailer said its $139.99 sleep gadget, known as Halo Rise, tracks room temperature, humidity and light, plus the breathing patterns of the person closest to it. The goal is to provide insight to users on why they may or may not feel well-rested when they wake up.

Like peers Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google, Amazon has invested in health-tracking technology for consumers, at times drawing regulatory scrutiny for sensitive information it aimed to collect, like body fat percentage via its fitness wristband called Halo.

Amazon has said privacy is foundational to its work. The sleep device will encrypt health data and has no camera or microphone.

The retailer is exploring health more broadly as well, announcing in July it would buy primary care provider One Medical (ONEM.O) for $3.5 billion.

The Halo Rise is not a medical device and not FDA-approved, Amazon said.

Beyond the bet on health, Amazon announced at its virtual devices showcase a new Kindle e-reader with a pen for annotating books digitally. The company also announced updated versions of its in-home and in-car speakers with voice control and new internet connectivity devices, among other gadgets.

438,117,APPLE,2022-09-28,Russia demands Apple explain VK removal from App Store,"Summary

Summary Companies This content was produced in Russia, where the law restricts coverage of Russian military operations in Ukraine.















MOSCOW, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Russia's communications regulator on Wednesday demanded an explanation from Apple (AAPL.O) after applications operated by the Russian state-controlled tech firm VK (VKCOq.L) were removed from the U.S. firm's App Store.

The regulator, Roskomnadzor, has been a thorn in the side of foreign tech firms, issuing fines over data storage violations and for failures to remove content Russia deems illegal - disputes that have escalated since Moscow sent its armed forces into Ukraine in February.

VK runs Vkontakte, which with over 75 million monthly users is Russia's largest social network, often compared to Facebook. Along with VK's email service Mail.ru, Vkontakte must be pre-installed on mobile devices sold in Russia.

Roskomnadzor said Apple's actions had deprived millions of Russians of access to VK apps and demanded that it explain its decision.

Apple said it follows laws in the jurisdictions where the company operates. Apple said the apps in question were being distributed by developers majority-owned or majority-controlled by one or more parties sanctioned by the UK government.

Regardless of location, the apps cannot be downloaded from any App store, said Apple, which terminated the developer accounts associated with the apps to comply with UK sanctions.

State-controlled VK tightened its grip on Russia's internet space this month by finalising a deal to buy rival Yandex's (YNDX.O) news aggregator, content platform Zen and yandex.ru homepage.

VK CEO Vladimir Kiriyenko is under UK sanctions, along with his father Sergei Kiriyenko, who serves as President Vladimir Putin's first deputy chief of staff.

Roskomnadzor called the restrictions ""discriminatory"" and said they violated Russian internet users' right to free information and communication.

Russia has, however, itself limited its citizens' access to information by forcing all significant independent Russian media to close and blocking U.S. social media platforms Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

VK on Tuesday said that its apps, including Vkontakte, continued to work if already installed on smartphones, and that it was continuing to develop and support apps for Apple's iOS operating system.

Roskomnadzor also asked Apple to explain its removal of other apps, including those of airline Aeroflot (AFLT.MM) and a number of banks such as top lenders Sberbank (SBER.MM) and VTB (VTBR.MM).

439,114,APPLE,2022-09-28,Fast Company shuts website after hack sends 'obscene' Apple News notifications,"













Sept 27 (Reuters) - U.S. business and media publication Fast Company said it shut down its website on Tuesday evening after the site was hacked and sent ""obscene and racist"" notifications to Apple users via the iPhone maker's Apple News service.

News publishers using the Apple News aggregation app can connect their digital publishing tools to Apple News to send push notifications to Apple customers who subscribe to the publisher's channel. Fast Company said hackers broke into those publishing tools.

Hackers sent two ""obscene and racist push notifications"" about a minute apart, Fast Company said in a tweet, adding it had suspended the Apple News feed until the situation was resolved.

""We are investigating the situation and have suspended the feed & shut down FastCompany.com until we are certain the situation has been resolved,"" the publication added.

Fast Company's website was down and the page displayed a 404 error when viewed by Reuters on Tuesday evening.

In a subsequent tweet after the shutdown, Fast Company said that its content management system - software used by news outlets to publish and manage their stories - had been hacked to send the notifications.

Apple News said in a tweet that it had disabled Fast Company's channel.

Fast Company said it had earlier suffered an ""apparently related"" hack of its website on Sunday afternoon, when similar language appeared on its home page, causing it to shut the site down for about two hours.

Fast Company is owned by publishing firm Mansueto Ventures LLC.

440,1,APPLE,2022-09-28,Apple tests idea of discretionary spending,"













NEW YORK, Sept 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apple (AAPL.O) may learn that its moat isn’t as wide during times of high inflation. The $2.4 trillion company led by Tim Cook put on ice plans to increase production of the newly launched iPhone 14 – which starts at $800 – because of softer demand, according to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter. When wallets are pinched, a new iPhone probably isn’t a must-have.

Apple was planning on increasing production of the iPhone 14 by as much as 6 million units, but instead, the company will target 90 million phones for the second half of the year, roughly the same level as the prior year and in line with Apple's original forecast in the summer, Bloomberg said. The strength of the U.S. dollar probably hasn’t helped. As other currencies have weakened relative to the dollar, Apple has had to raise prices to keep the cost steady relative to America.

Already Apple’s share of the global smartphone market has declined sharply to 16% in the second quarter from 23% penetration in the fourth quarter last year, according to research firm IDC. As the cost of food, utilities and rent soars, people may reconsider what is a necessary item. (By Jennifer Saba)

Sept 28 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) shares fell more than 4% on Wednesday after a report that the tech giant was ditching its plans to boost production of the latest iPhone fueled demand worries.

Bloomberg earlier reported that Apple had told its suppliers to curtail efforts to increase the assembly of its iPhone 14 lineup by as many as 6 million units in the second half of the year on disappointing demand. read more

Shares of the world's most valuable public company opened at a two-month low of $147.64 and were the biggest drag on the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (.DJI).

""Weaker consumer demand is to be expected when utility bills are going up, interest rates are going up, mortgage costs are going higher ... discretionary spending is going to be curtailed by that,"" said Patrick Armstrong, chief investment officer at Plurimi Wealth in London.

Analysts said iPhone 14's Pro and Pro Max versions were selling at a brisk pace, although demand for the base model, typically Apple's best seller, was underwhelming.

Apart from satellite connectivity and crash detection features, the iPhone 14 model looks and feels similar to its previous iteration, although it sells for $100 more at $799 for the base version. The Pro models, which start at $999, come with fresher upgrades.

Prospective iPhone 14 buyers may opt for iPhone 13, given the hefty discount on the older model, said Abhilash Kumar of data research firm Strategy Analytics.

Wedbush analysts said the product mix has heavily shifted toward Pro, pushing wait times into early November for some models, and that Apple could be shifting production from the base model to Pro across Asia ahead of the holiday season.

Shares of Apple suppliers Qualcomm (QCOM.O), Taiwan Semiconductor , STMicroelectronics , Infineon (IFXGn.DE) and ASML (ASML.AS) were also trading lower on the news.

Sept 27 (Reuters) - Apple Inc is dropping plans to increase production of its new iPhones this year after an anticipated surge in demand failed to materialize, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The company told suppliers to curtail efforts to increase assembly of its flagship iPhone 14 product family by as many as 6 million units in the second half of this year, Bloomberg reported.

Instead, the Cupertino, California-headquartered company will aim to produce 90 million handsets for the period, nearly the same number as a year ago and in line with Apple's original forecast this summer, the report said.

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Demand for the higher-priced iPhone 14 Pro models is stronger than for the entry-level versions and at least one Apple supplier is shifting production capacity from lower-priced iPhones to premium models, Bloomberg reported.

Apple had this week said it would start manufacturing the iPhone 14, launched earlier this month, in India, as the tech giant moves some of its production away from China. read more

443,740,APPLE,2022-09-28,"Morgan Lewis adds patent team, Silicon Valley leader from Duane Morris","













Sept 29 - Morgan, Lewis & Bockius on Wednesday said it has picked up a five-member patent prosecution team from rival law firm Duane Morris, including Manita Rawat, managing partner of the firm's Silicon Valley office.

The team also includes of counsel Daniel Tarr in Philadelphia, associate Tairan (Terry) Wang in Washington, D.C., Chicago-based patent prosecution specialist Mona Batmani and senior paralegal Sherlin Yaghoubzadeh in Los Angeles.

Rawat, who served on Duane Morris' governing partners' board, has represented Fortune 100 and large technology companies, Morgan Lewis said. Her clients have included MGM Resorts International and Walmart Inc.

A Duane Morris spokesperson wished Rawat well, adding that the firm is poised to expand its footprint in Silicon Valley by absorbing labor and employment firm Curley, Hurtgen & Johnsrud.

Stephen Sutro, a white-collar litigator who leads Duane Morris' San Francisco office, will now also lead the Silicon Valley office, the spokesperson added.

Both Morgan Lewis and Duane Morris, which have international offices, were founded in Philadelphia.

Rawat's team ""extends the capabilities"" of Morgan Lewis' roster of intellectual property lawyers, IP leader Louis Beardell said in a statement.

Morgan Lewis six months ago lost 19 of its IP lawyers and professionals in southern California to BakerHostetler. Among the lawyers who left was Mark Itri, who at one time counted Apple Inc, Lockheed Martin Corp and Alphabet Inc's Google as his clients.

Duane Morris, meanwhile, has spent the past month beefing up other practice areas. In addition to its pending merger with Curley, Hurtgen & Johnsrud, the firm last week added a team of employment litigators from Seyfarth Shaw, including Gerald Maatman, the chair of its complex discrimination litigation/class action practice group.

444,785,APPLE,2022-09-28,"Facing talent shortage, Taiwanese chip test firm ASE boosts automation","













TAIPEI, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Taiwan's ASE Technology Holding Co Ltd (3711.TW), one of the world's largest semiconductor testing and packaging firms, said on Wednesday that it would build a more advanced smart factory, as the industry continues to grapple with a labour shortage.

The new factory in Kaohsiung, powered by U.S. chip designer Qualcomm Inc's Snapdragon system, will be the first in the world to deploy a ""5G mmWave new radio-dual connectivity standalone"" network to improve speed, stability and equipment efficiency, the company said, marking the latest advance in ASE's automation push.

Apple Inc supplier ASE, which began investing in automated factories in 2015, told Reuters it plans to build 10 smart factories this year, reaching a total of 37 smart factories in Taiwan by the end of the year.

""To counter the talent crunch and adapt to diverse customer requirements, ASE is accelerating its adoption of smart manufacturing technologies including automation,"" the company said in a statement.

The talent shortage in the semiconductor industry remains a top concern, executives from companies throughout the chip supply chain from design to manufacturing have told Reuters.

Chip companies in Taiwan have been rapidly expanding in recent years, spurred in part by a pandemic-induced surge in demand for chips, and face fierce competition from local and foreign companies recruiting from a shrinking pool of engineers.

Taiwan's government last year partnered with industry to establish specialised ""chip schools"" to boost engineering talent for the prized sector on the island, home to the world's largest contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) (2330.TW).

""We hope to lead by example and inspire more industry players to contribute to building a resilient global smart manufacturing and equipment cluster,"" ASE Chief Executive Tien Wu said in a statement.

445,795,APPLE,2022-09-29,Chevron’s geographical transition sends bad signal,"













NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Chevron (CVX.N) is joining the migration to the Lone Star State. The $285 billion oil and gas driller has sold its California campus and is moving about 200 more employees to Texas. It still has a large Golden State presence and will keep its headquarters there, and the decision makes some sense. Even so, it sends a bad signal about energy transition.

Texas offers low taxes for both companies and individuals, and as a result attracted more than 310,000 new residents between 2020 and 2021, according to U.S. Census Bureau data, accounting for nearly 8 out of 10 U.S. relocations. California lost more than 261,000 people over the same span. Texas Governor Greg Abbott is reveling. He tweeted just last month that “Texas does it AGAIN!” when cell therapy company Cellipont decided to relocate.

Given the relaxed approach to drilling and climate change in Texas, however, the latest choices by Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth warrant a raise of the eyebrow. Compared to his many Texas-based peers, his company gets some credit for operating in a state that champions green energy and electric vehicles. If proximity signals adaptation, Chevron seems to be moving slowly in the wrong direction. (By Lauren Silva Laughlin)

446,423,APPLE,2022-09-29,Split deepens on incentive awards for class representatives,"













(Reuters) - The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals just made it clear that the U.S. Supreme Court will have to decide whether lead plaintiffs in class actions are entitled to a nominal fee for their work on behalf of the class.

On Wednesday, a three-judge 9th Circuit panel ruled emphatically in In re Apple Inc Device Performance Litigation that incentive awards for lead plaintiffs are not categorically prohibited by a pair of 19th century Supreme Court decisions disallowing payments to representative plaintiffs for their personal time and expenses. That holding is squarely at odds with the 11th Circuit’s 2020 decision in Johnson v. NPAS Solutions, LLC, which concluded that class action service awards for lead plaintiffs are barred by Supreme Court precedent in 1881’s Trustees v. Greenough and 1885’s Central Railroad v. Pettus.

The 11th Circuit opted in August not to rehear the NPAS case en banc, despite a dissent in which Judge Jill Pryor insisted that the elimination of incentive awards “will have a very real and detrimental impact on class actions in this circuit, an impact that will be felt not least by the most vulnerable plaintiffs such as consumers and small businesses.”

The plaintiffs' firm that unsuccessfully sought en banc review at the 11th Circuit, Keller Postman, told me earlier this month that it is planning to ask the Supreme Court to review the NPAS decision, although no petition has yet been filed.

Even before the 9th Circuit’s Apple decision, appellate circuits were split on the significance of the Greenough and Pettus decisions in modern-day class actions. Earlier this month, you may recall, the 2nd Circuit declined to adopt the 11th Circuit’s reasoning in its Sept. 7 decision in Hyland v. Navient Corporation.

The Navient panel said it was bound by the 2nd Circuit’s previous -- albeit cursory -- holding in 2019’s Melito v. Experian Marketing Solutions, Inc that the ancient Supreme Court decisions in Greenough and Pettus were “inapposite.”

The lawyer who has pioneered the theory that those two decisions preclude incentive awards, objectors’ counsel Eric Isaacson, has since filed a petition for the en banc 2nd Circuit to take up the issue, arguing that the panel in the Navient case failed to grapple with the 11th Circuit’s interpretation of Greenough and Pettus.

Isaacson told me when the Navient panel issued its ruling that it was premature to speculate about whether the Supreme Court would have to resolve the split because of the possibility that the 2nd Circuit would agree to reconsider its precedent en banc.

But the new 9th Circuit decision leaves no doubt that the panel – Judges Jacqueline Nguyen, John Owens and Ryan Nelson – disagrees with the 11th Circuit’s interpretation of Greenough and Pettus. What’s more, the 9th Circuit panel seemed to go out of its way to address the issue of incentive awards, even though Apple’s lawyers at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and class counsel from Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy and Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer did not substantively address the 11th Circuit’s precedent in their appellate briefing.

In the Apple appeal, which challenged a $310 million settlement of allegations that Apple secretly “throttled” the performance of certain iPhone operating systems in order to minimize phones from shutting off unexpectedly, objectors represented by John Pentz, Kendrick Jan and Jan Westfall urged the 9th Circuit to adopt the 11th Circuit’s prohibition on incentive awards.

The objectors argued that the two 19th century Supreme Court decisions clearly bar representative plaintiffs from recovering compensation beyond their legal fees. Those rulings long pre-date modern class actions, the objectors’ brief said, but the now-routine practice of awarding incentive fees to name plaintiffs has never been reconciled with Greenough and Pettus precedent.

“These two seminal cases have been ignored by modern courts when rationalizing awards to lead plaintiffs, whether as a bounty for obtaining a settlement, or compensation for hours spent on litigation tasks or exposure to reputational risk,” the objectors argued. “None of these rationales can surmount the constraints established by Greenough and Pettus.”

The 9th Circuit panel disagreed, holding that reasonable incentive awards are permissible under the common fund doctrine, which allows representative plaintiffs to pay their lawyers from a class-wide settlement fund. Class representatives are not entitled to big payouts, the 9th Circuit said, because such a “special reward” or a “salary” might create a conflict between the name plaintiffs and other class members. In the Greenough case, for instance, the award struck down by the Supreme Court would have amounted to nearly a half-million dollars a year. But that’s a far cry, the 9th Circuit said, from the modest $1,500 payments to most of the lead plaintiffs in the Apple case.”

“The point is that incentive awards cannot categorically be rejected or approved,” Nguyen wrote for the unanimous panel. “So long as they are reasonable, they can be awarded.” (The court nevertheless vacated the Apple incentive awards, as well as the entire settlement and an $80 million fee award, for reconsideration by the trial court under a more exacting standard of review.)

Objectors’ counsel Pentz told me by email that he would welcome Supreme Court guidance on incentive awards. If the federal rules governing class actions allow for such payouts, he said, “It is up to the Supreme Court to say so, and not the district courts from the 1970s who are cited in the Jill Pryor dissent” in the NPAS case, Pentz said. (The Supreme Court mentioned such awards glancingly in a footnote in its 2018 ruling in China Agritech, Inc v. Resh but did not analyze their propriety in light of Greenough and Pettus precedent.)

Even Isaacson, the objectors’ lawyer who has petitioned the 2nd Circuit to look en banc at incentive awards, agreed via email that the odds of Supreme Court review have increased with the 9th Circuit decision, although he insisted that the panel’s discussion of such awards was not well-reasoned.

I suspect he will get to make that point to the Supreme Court sooner than later.

447,210,APPLE,2022-09-29,Apple senior exec leaves iPhone maker after remark in viral video,"













Sept 29 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) Tony Blevins, a key player in the company's supply chain operations, is leaving the iPhone maker, the company confirmed on Thursday, without providing a reason.

The move comes after a TikTok video of the executive making a crude remark about women went viral. Bloomberg first reported Blevins' departure.

In a video on TikTok published earlier this month, Blevins can be heard saying, ""I have rich cars, play golf and fondle big-breasted women, but I take weekends and major holidays off"" in response to a question on what he did for a living.

Blevins had been approached by TikTok content creator Daniel Mac at a car show as part of a video series in which Mac asks owners of expensive cars their occupations.

Both Mac and Blevins' companion in a Mercedes sports car were laughing as Blevins spoke off the cuff while exiting the car. Bloomberg reported that Blevins appeared to be referencing a nearly identical line spoken by the main character in the 1981 film ""Arthur.""

Apple did not comment on the reason for Blevins' departure. Reuters attempts to reach Blevins for comment were unsuccessful. Bloomberg cited a statement from Blevins in which the executive apologized for causing offense with what he called a ""mistaken attempt at humor.""

Blevins, a vice president at Apple, had an important role in the company's supply chain operations.

His job involved lining up anywhere from two to six suppliers for each of the thousands of components in Apple's products and playing those suppliers off one another to get better prices for Apple. A 2020 profile of Blevins in the Wall Street Journal said he was know inside the iPhone maker as ""the Blevinator.""

MILAN, Sept 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tod’s (TOD.MI) founder Diego Della Valle is seeking to delist his bling shoemaker on the cheap. The Italian tycoon on Monday launched a takeover bid at 40 euros a share for the company he controls with a 65% stake. The bid, which offers a skimpy 20% premium and matches Tod’s 2000 listing price, looks a bit opportunistic. Economic uncertainties linked to the Ukrainian war had dragged the Italian high-end group’s shares down 35% this year before the offer came along.

Investor Tabor Asset Management believes that, taken separately, the Italian group’s brands warrant an offer of at least 76 euros a share. That’s probably ambitious. But the argument has merit. Assuming total revenue growth of 7% in 2023, pricey pumps maker Roger Vivier could be worth 1 billion euros at Prada’s 4 times sales multiple. And the Tod’s brand itself could be worth the same if valued on a par with Salvatore Ferragamo’s (SFER.MI) 1.9 times revenue multiple. Weaker players Fay and Hogan could jointly fetch some 500 million euros if valued at a cross between Ferragamo and H&M’s (HMb.ST) valuations. That would push the price tag to 60 euros a share, 50% above the current offer, Breakingviews calculations show. With so much hidden value to reap, Della Valle can probably afford to be a tad more generous. (By Lisa Jucca)

449,876,APPLE,2022-09-29,Singapore air cargo deal elevates its hub status,"













MUMBAI, Sept 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Singapore is boosting its hub status as global recession fears loom. Aviation services group SATS (SATS.SI) is acquiring the world’s largest air cargo logistics provider for $2.2 billion from U.S. buyout firm Cerberus. The backing of its sovereign fund shareholder Temasek will help the buyer complete a supporting equity issuance, equivalent to 40% of its $3 billion market capitalisation, in a grim market.

The deal is highly complementary: Paris-based Worldwide Flight Services, a rival to Dnata and Swissport, has almost no geographical overlap with its acquirer. The enlarged entity will be present in 23 countries and handle 9 million tonnes of goods annually, giving it an edge over smaller competitors in attracting customers like e-commerce firms and vaccine-makers that want to work with a single global provider to minimise supply chain issues.

The deal could ultimately lift trade flows through Singapore where aviation contributes more than 5% of GDP. SATS is part of the city-state’s industry trinity that includes its former parent Singapore Airlines (SIAL.SI) and Changi Airport. As global cargo activity nears pre-pandemic levels, Singapore is providing a strategic home to an asset that’s passed through multiple financial owners. (By Una Galani and Thomas Shum)

450,716,APPLE,2022-09-29,LeBron deal dinks pickleball into big leagues,"













NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Pickleball is all the rage and just received a professional endorsement. Basketball superstar LeBron James and his investment firm LRMV Ventures became the new part owner of a yet-to-be-named Major League Pickleball team. His backing – amount unspecified – represents part of the league’s expansion from 12 to 16 teams, where players will compete next year in six tournaments for more than $2 million. By comparison, the purse for the champion of the U.S. Open tennis tournament is $2.6 million.

The game, a bit like playing ping pong while standing on the table, is one of the fastest-growing recreational activities in the United States. Last year, more than 5 million people played Pickleball, a 15% increase from 2020, according to its nonprofit governing body. MLP is targeting 40 million players by 2030. An eightfold increase may seem ambitious, but the racket game founded by three dads in the Seattle area is simple to pick up, easy on the knees, and yet allows for fierce competition. Pickleball may be a slam dunk for LeBron. (By Jennifer Saba)

451,337,APPLE,2022-09-30,Exclusive: Senior Indonesian officials targeted by spyware last year,"[1/2] Airlangga Hartarto, Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, wearing a protective mask reacts during an interview with Reuters at the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, Indonesia, November 13, 2020. REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan/File Photo















Sept 30 (Reuters) - More than a dozen senior Indonesian government and military officials were targeted last year with spy software designed by an Israeli surveillance firm, according to nine people with knowledge of the matter.

Six of the individuals told Reuters they were targeted themselves.

The targets included Chief Economic Minister Airlangga Hartarto, senior military personnel, two regional diplomats, and advisers in Indonesia's defence and foreign affairs ministries, according to the people.

Six of the Indonesian officials and advisers targeted told Reuters they received an email message from Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in November 2021 telling them that Apple believed officials were being ""targeted by state-sponsored attackers.""

Apple has not disclosed the identities or number of users targeted. The company declined to comment for this story.

Apple and security researchers have said the recipients of the warnings were targeted using ForcedEntry, an advanced piece of software that has been used by Israeli cyber surveillance vendor NSO Group to help foreign spy agencies remotely and invisibly take control of iPhones. Another Israeli cyber firm, QuaDream, has developed a nearly identical hacking tool, Reuters has reported.

Reuters was unable to determine who made or used the spyware to target the Indonesian officials, whether the attempts were successful, and, if so, what the hackers might have obtained.

The attempt to target Indonesian officials, which has not previously been reported, is one of the biggest cases yet seen of the software being used against government, military and defence ministry personnel, according to cybersecurity experts.

Spokespeople for the Indonesian government, the Indonesian military, the Indonesian Defence Ministry and the Indonesian Cyber and Crypto Agency (BSSN) did not respond to requests for comments and emailed questions.

A spokesman for the Foreign Affairs Ministry said they were unaware of the case and referred Reuters to BSSN.

Alia Karenina, a spokesperson for Airlangga's ministry, said the minister, a top ally of Indonesia's President Joko Widodo, did not receive any notification from Apple about the attempted hack on his official email account.

She said the minister has not installed his official email on his personal phone and uses multiple mobile devices. Alia did not respond to questions on whether other emails used by Airlangga received a warning from Apple.

The use of ForcedEntry, which exploits a flaw in iPhones through a new hacking technique that requires no user interactions, was made public by cybersecurity watchdog Citizen Lab in September 2021. Google security researchers described it as the ""most technically sophisticated"" hacking attack they had ever seen, in a company blog post published in December.

Apple patched the vulnerability in September last year and in November started sending notification messages to what it called a ""small number of users that it discovered may have been targeted.""

In response to Reuters questions, an NSO spokesperson denied the company’s software was involved in the targeting of Indonesian officials, dismissing it as ""contractually and technologically impossible,"" without specifying why. The company, which does not disclose the identity of its customers, says it sells its products only to ""vetted and legitimate"" government entities.

QuaDream did not respond to requests for comment.

In addition to the six officials and advisers who told Reuters they were targeted, a director at a state-owned Indonesian firm that provides weapons to the Indonesian army got the same message from Apple, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. The people asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. The company director did not respond to requests for comment.

Within weeks of Apple's notification in November last year, the U.S. government added NSO to the Department of Commerce's 'entity list,' which makes it harder for U.S. companies to do business with it, after determining that the firm's phone-hacking technology had been used by foreign governments to ""maliciously target"" political dissidents around the world.

452,223,APPLE,2022-09-30,"Apple, rebuffed in bid for appeal to shield Tim Cook emails, asks 9th Circuit for help","













(Reuters) - Apple Inc’s hope for a mid-case appeal to shield sensitive internal documents -- including 2018 email exchanges between CEO Tim Cook and top corporate officials as Apple weighed whether to tell investors that its revenue estimate was off by billions of dollars -- was dashed on Thursday.

U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, who is overseeing a shareholder class action alleging that Apple misled investors about softening demand for iPhones in China in early 2019, rejected Apple’s request that she certify an interlocutory appeal of a ruling that the company must give shareholders some of the internal documents for which Apple had claimed attorney client privilege. Rogers held in Thursday’s decision that Apple’s lawyers at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe failed to satisfy any of the three requirements for an interlocutory appeal of a non-dispositive order.

Apple isn't yet ready to concede, however. On Friday, the company filed a last-ditch mandamus petition to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, asking the appellate court to reverse Rogers’ “clearly erroneous” decision. The petition contends that Rogers' ruling “threatens to eviscerate Apple’s attorney-client privilege and to jeopardize protections for many other companies seeking to comply with the law as they go about doing business.” The company also asked Rogers to stay her order that it turn over the materials until the 9th Circuit has reviewed and resolved its mandamus petition.

Apple and lead counsel James Kramer of Orrick did not respond to my query. Shareholder lawyer Shawn Williams of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd declined to comment.

The crux of Apple's argument to maintain a shield on the internal documents is that there’s uncertainty in the 9th Circuit’s existing standard for evaluating privilege claims for so-called dual purpose documents that involve both business and litigation advice. Last January, the appeals court ruled in In re Grand Jury that courts should consider whether business advice was a primary purpose for the communication, in which case the documents might not be protected by privilege.

But the appeals court left open the question of whether privilege shields documents that have both a business and legal purpose if legal advice is a primary purpose of the communication but not necessarily the sole primary purpose. (The defendant in the In re Grand Jury case has asked the U.S. Supreme Court for review, arguing that the justices must resolve variations between the federal circuits on the privilege test for dual purpose documents.)

The judge initially tasked with evaluating Apple’s privilege claims, U.S. Chief Magistrate Judge Joseph Spero, applied the 9th Circuit’s In re Grand Jury test. He concluded in August that (among other things) some communications between Apple CEO Cook, general counsel Katherine Adams and CFO Luca Maestri involved business advice and must therefore be turned over to shareholders. Rogers upheld Spero’s findings in a Sept. 7 order, prompting Apple to ask the district judge for leave to appeal to the 9th Circuit.

Apple argued, in effect, that the magistrate might have reached a different conclusion about some of the contested documents if he had applied a more expansive test that preserves privilege whenever litigation is a primary purpose of communications.

In Apple’s view, when Cook sought advice from Adams and Maestri in 2018, as the company weighed whether to issue a public revision of its revenue estimates based on a slowing Chinese market, the communications between these top officials clearly anticipated the prospect of litigation. (And rightly so: After Apple disclosed the revised revenue estimate, its share price fell by about $16. Shareholders, predictably, sued, citing Cook’s previous assertion that the Chinese market remained strong.)

Therefore, in Apple’s view, the company is entitled to privilege for communications with a primary litigation purpose, even if the documents also discussed the business implications of a downward revision of revenue estimates.

Rogers disagreed with Apple’s assumptions in Thursday’s decision. As an initial matter, the judge said, the magistrate did not indicate that any of the communications he ordered Apple to turn over actually had both legal and non-legal primary purposes. So even if the 9th Circuit clarified its standard for dual purpose documents, Rogers said, it’s unlikely that any refinement of the Grand Jury test would change the magistrate’s fact-specific findings about particular documents he deemed to be non-privileged.

The judge also said that Apple overstated any uncertainty in the 9th Circuit test. Although the appeals court specifically noted that it was not deciding whether litigation advice must be the primary purpose – as opposed to only a primary purpose – in order to maintain privilege, Rogers pointed out that the 9th Circuit said in the Grand Jury decision that such distinctions will rarely matter.

Moreover, Rogers said, Apple failed to show that an interlocutory appeal would advance the litigation, which is quite far along. Apple has already moved for summary judgment, and shareholders have filed motions to exclude Apple experts at trial. “It is not clear,"" Roger wrote, ""that the scope of plaintiff’s claims and what is available to support them will even change based on the discoverability of the documents in question.”

Rogers ordered Apple to produce the documents within 24 hours.

Instead, Apple filed a mandamus petition. The company, which seems to be dead-set on keeping Cook’s emails private, told the 9th Circuit that Spero, the magistrate, erred when he concluded that privilege does not apply to communications with a business purpose even if those communications also involved litigation advice. Rogers compounded that error, Apple said, in upholding Spero’s order and refusing to allow the company to seek interlocutory appeal.

“The district court assessed Apple’s attorney-client privilege claims under a single-primary-purpose test for the dual-purpose communications at issue,” Apple insisted. “That test is not required by this court’s precedent; conflicts with well-settled principles of common law and the weight of authority; and is unworkable in the business context.”

Apple told the 9th Circuit that this dispute is bigger than just its case because CEOs like Cook need attorney-client protection when they seek advice from other executives on complex issues that implicate both business and litigation concerns.

Will the 9th Circuit bite? Stay tuned.

453,254,APPLE,2022-10-03,Mobile phone critic Pope Francis meets Apple chief Tim Cook,"













VATICAN CITY, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Pope Francis, who has often said people should limit their use of cellphones and give preference to personal communication, granted a private audience on Monday to Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook.

Cook, head of the $2.4 trillion company whose iPhone has revolutionised personal communication, was on the pope's daily audience list. As is customary, the Vatican did not disclose what was discussed during the private conversation.

The 85-year-old pope has a mixed relationship with cellphones. Last year, he interrupted his general audience when an aide passed him a cellphone and took an urgent call from a senior Vatican official.

He often patiently allows people to take selfies with him.

But he has also regularly warned people against becoming slaves to cellphones and other forms of technology.

""Free yourself from the addiction to mobile phones,"" he told young people in 2019. ""When you become a slave to your mobile phone, you lose your freedom.""

On other occasions, he has said it was sad that people use their cellphone at the dinner table or while attending Mass.

454,421,APPLE,2022-10-03,U.S. Supreme Court grants review in crucial attorney-client privilege case,"













(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court agreed on Monday to take up an issue with profound consequences for lawyers who advise clients on complex issues with both legal and business implications.

The justices granted review of In re Grand Jury, a January 2022 ruling in which the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that attorney-client privilege does not shield communications with the primary purpose of providing business advice, even if the communication also offers legal advice.

The 9th Circuit declined in Grand Jury to adopt the D.C. Circuit’s more expansive privilege test from 2014’s In re Kellogg Brown & Root Inc, which held that privilege applies to documents with a dual business and legal purpose as long as legal advice was a primary purpose of the communication between the lawyer and client.

Now the Supreme Court will presumably have to reconcile those two decisions.

The 9th Circuit case involved a grand jury subpoena to an unnamed law firm that specializes in international tax issues, including advising clients on the tax consequences of expatriation. The grand jury was conducting a criminal investigation of one of the firm’s clients. The firm, according to its petition for Supreme Court review, withheld certain documents, claiming that privilege shielded communications that served a dual purpose of providing the client with legal advice about taxes while also facilitating the preparation of the client’s tax returns.

The 9th Circuit disagreed, ordering the law firm to produce documents that had the primary purpose of providing business advice. The appeals court took note of the D.C. Circuit’s more expansive view of privilege in the Kellogg case, but said that it did not need to adopt the Kellogg standard — which arose in the context of an internal investigation — in a tax case, since precedent has already established that general tax preparation advice, even from lawyers, is not typically privileged.

The unnamed law firm told the Supreme Court that the 9th Circuit’s test is unworkable in real life, when clients routinely seek advice from their lawyers on issues with both business and legal considerations. Munger, Tolles & Olson, which represents the unnamed law firm, argued that the 9th Circuit’s Grand Jury decision puts trial courts in the unenviable position of having to weigh the legal and non-legal implications of individual communications in order to decide, after the fact, which purpose predominated.

The law firm said the D.C. Circuit’s Kellogg test is much more sensible because it asks only if legal advice was a primary reason for the communication, without requiring the trial court to weigh the relative significance of the document’s business and legal purposes.

The law firm’s petition for Supreme Court review was no doubt boosted by its frequent references to the author of the D.C. Circuit’s Kellogg opinion: Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote Kellogg when he was a judge on the D.C. Circuit.

The petition also benefited from three strong amicus briefs asserting that the 9th Circuit test is ill-suited for the modern reality of representing clients in complex matters. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Washington Legal Foundation and the California Lawyers Association told the Supreme Court that the competing 9th and D.C. Circuit privilege tests — as well as a wild-card 7th Circuit holding that tax advice is never privileged — have left practitioners scratching their heads about whether their client communications are susceptible to discovery.

“Most fundamentally, the 9th Circuit's single-purpose standard does not reflect the modern role that lawyers play in advising businesses,” wrote the Chamber’s lawyers at Williams & Connolly. “Legal issues often arise in analyzing larger business issues. When legal and business issues are discussed in the same communication, the reasons for protecting the confidentiality of legal communications do not suddenly evaporate.”

The Washington Legal Foundation’s amicus brief highlighted the role of in-house lawyers, whose advice to corporate executives frequently mingles business and legal considerations. The group argued that the 9th Circuit’s test will chill those discussions: “There is no reason,” the amicus brief said, “for in-house counsel to give legal advice if communications can later be disclosed during a government investigation or civil litigation.”

The U.S. Justice Department did not respond to my query on the Supreme Court’s grant of review. Its opposition brief focused on the tax context of the 9th Circuit case, arguing that courts already construe privilege narrowly in tax cases and the 9th Circuit’s decision was rooted in the particular facts of the tax advice provided to the unnamed client.

If you are a regular reader of my column, however, you know that the 9th Circuit’s Grand Jury test is not limited to tax cases. I told you last week about a fight between Apple Inc and shareholder lawyers over internal Apple documents, including emails between CEO Tim Cook and Apple’s general counsel as the company weighed an unusual public revision of revenue estimates in late 2018. The trial judge in the Apple class action, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of Oakland, held last month that the disputed documents are not privileged under the 9th Circuit’s Grand Jury test because their primary purpose was business advice, not legal counsel.

After Rogers refused to certify an interlocutory appeal, Apple on Friday filed a mandamus petition at the 9th Circuit. Its lawyers from Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe argued that Rogers misapplied the Grand Jury test — but, more broadly, urged the 9th Circuit to adopt the D.C. Circuit’s Kellogg test and clarify that privilege applies whenever legal advice is a primary purpose of corporate communications.

It's not clear how Monday’s Supreme Court grant will affect the privilege dispute in the Apple case, in which shareholders allege that the company deceived investors about weakening demand for iPhones in China. James Kramer of Orrick did not respond to my query about the justices agreeing to take up the Grand Jury case.

The Grand Jury case isn’t likely to inspire protests on the steps of the Supreme Court or to prompt headlines about ideological divisions among the justices, but for lawyers across a wide spectrum of practice areas, it’s actually one of the most important cases of the term.

455,323,APPLE,2022-10-03,Will Smith's first movie since Oscars slap to be released in December,"













LOS ANGELES, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Actor Will Smith's first movie since he slapped Chris Rock at the Academy Awards, a historical thriller called ""Emancipation,"" will debut in cinemas in December, a move that makes the film eligible for next year's Oscars.

Distributor Apple Inc (AAPL.O) announced the timing in a statement and released a trailer on Monday. ""Emancipation,"" which tells the story of a man who escapes from slavery, was filmed before Smith attacked Rock on stage in February but its release date had been uncertain.

Smith is banned from attending the Oscars ceremony for 10 years, but he is still eligible to be nominated and win.

The actor has publicly apologized to Rock, the film academy and the public for slapping the comedian over a joke about the appearance of Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.

Less than an hour later, Smith won best actor for playing the father of tennis legends Venus and Serena Williams in ""King Richard.""

""Emancipation"" will play exclusively in theaters for one week starting on Dec. 2 and will debut on the Apple TV+ streaming service on Dec. 9, Apple said.

The movie was inspired by a real-life story of a man who became known as ""Whipped Peter"" after Harper's Weekly published images in 1863 of extensive scarring on his back from whippings he received as a slave.

456,107,APPLE,2022-10-03,Apple loses second bid to challenge Qualcomm patents at U.S. Supreme Court,"













WASHINGTON, Oct 3 - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday again declined to hear Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) bid to revive an effort to cancel three Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) smartphone patents despite the settlement of the underlying dispute between the two tech giants.

The justices left in place a lower court's decision against Apple after similarly turning away in June the company's appeal of a lower court ruling in a closely related case challenging two other Qualcomm patents. read more

Qualcomm sued Apple in San Diego federal court in 2017, arguing that its iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches infringed a variety of mobile-technology patents. That case was part of a broader global dispute between the tech giants.

Apple challenged the validity of the patents at issue in this case at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's Patent Trial and Appeal Board.

The companies settled their underlying fight in 2019, signing an agreement worth billions of dollars that let Apple continue using Qualcomm chips in iPhones. The settlement included an Apple license to thousands of Qualcomm patents, but allowed the patent-board proceedings to continue.

The board upheld the patents in 2020, and Apple appealed to the patent-specialist U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Cupertino, California-based Apple argued it had proper legal standing to appeal because San Diego-based Qualcomm could sue again after the license expires, potentially as soon as 2025.

A Federal Circuit three-judge panel, in a 2-1 ruling, dismissed the case last year for a lack of standing, finding that Apple's risk of being sued again was speculative and the challenge would not affect its payment obligations under the settlement.

Qualcomm has again argued that Apple has not shown a concrete injury to justify the appeal, just like in the ""materially identical"" case that the high court rejected.

458,717,APPLE,2022-10-03,Dutch food company HAK to pause operations in January as energy costs bite,"













AMSTERDAM, Oct 3 (Reuters) - HAK, a major seller of conserved foods such as peas, beans and apple sauce in the Netherlands, is to temporarily halt production this winter due to high energy costs, with a spokesperson saying the pause would last six weeks from January.

Dutch national broadcaster NOS cited HAK director Timo Hoogeboom as saying the decision would not lead to empty grocery store shelves as the company keeps extra supply in case of disruption.

A household name in the Netherlands, HAK was sold to Russia's KDV Group by NPM Capital last year for an undisclosed sum.

According to Dutch Chamber of Commerce records, HAK and related companies had sales of 100.2 million euros ($98 million) and operating profit of 10.2 million euros in 2021.

""If companies have to sell under their cost price for months on end, then things will turn out badly,"" NOS further quoted Hoogeboom as saying.

Earlier on Monday the Union of Dutch Fruit and Vegetable Processors (VIGEF) called for the government to either impose a cap on gas prices, as Germany has done, or offer support for companies.

""It's of importance to do this in line with other countries around us, to guarantee the continued existence of this industry and its supply chain, and to ensure that healthy food from Dutch soil remains affordable and available,"" VIGEF said.

Food packed in cans and jars is usually heated to help reduce the need for artificial preservatives.

In addition, VIGEF estimated that the cost of metal and glass used in such packaging has risen to 25-35% of its members costs, from 5%, while farmers are also struggling with higher fertiliser prices among other rising costs.

""It is not possible to keep absorbing these costs,"" VIGEF said.

The outbound shipments of India-made iPhones, mainly to Europe and the Middle East, are set to reach $2.5 billion in the 12 months through March 2023, almost double when compared to the year through March 2022, the report said, citing sources.

Apple started making the iPhone 13 in India earlier this year, and the company announced last week its plans to manufacture the latest iPhone 14. The tech giant has been manufacturing iPhones in India from 2017.

The devices exported from India from April to August this year comprise iPhone 11, 12 and 13 models, Bloomberg said.

The report comes as Apple seeks to shift some areas of iPhone production from China to other markets including India, the second biggest smartphone market in the world, where it is also planning to assemble iPad tablets.

India and countries such as Mexico and Vietnam are increasingly turning important to contract manufacturers supplying to American brands as they seek to diversify production away from China, amid COVID-related lockdowns and simmering tensions between Washington and Beijing.

Apple did not immediately respond to Reuters's request for comment.

461,176,APPLE,2022-10-04,Apple forced to change charger in Europe as EU approves overhaul,"Summary

Summary Companies EU Parliament approves single charger reform

Standard is USB-C, used in Android-based devices

Common charging port required for new phones from autumn 2024

Laptops will have to be compatible with single charger from 2026















BRUSSELS, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) will have to change the charger for its iPhones in the European Union from autumn 2024 to comply with new rules introducing a single charging port for most electronic devices.

The reform passed by an overwhelming majority in the European Parliament on Tuesday, the first of its kind anywhere in the world, potentially strengthens the EU's role as a global standard-setter on telephone technology. The vote confirmed an earlier agreement among EU institutions. read more

The new rules will make USB-C connectors used by Android-based devices the standard across the 27-nation bloc, forcing Apple to change its charging port for iPhones and other devices.

It will also apply to laptops from 2026, giving manufacturers longer to adapt, although many already use USB-C.

Apple is expected to be the most affected of the big providers of electronic devices to European customers, although analysts say the impact could be positive if it encourages shoppers to buy the U.S. company's new gadgets instead of ones without USB-C.

Shares in European semiconductor manufacturers rose on Tuesday after the vote, including those of Apple suppliers STMicro and Infineon .

The deal also covers e-readers, ear buds and other technologies, meaning it may also have an impact on Samsung (005930.KS), Huawei [RIC:RIC:HWT.UL] and other device makers, analysts said.

Apple, Samsung and Huawei were not immediately available for comment.

Under the reform, mobile phones and other devices sold after autumn 2024 will have to be compatible with the single charger, said Alex Agius Saliba, the EU lawmaker who steered the reform through the EU assembly. Old chargers will not be outlawed, however, so that customers can continue to use older models.

The large size of the EU market means the new rules may lead to changes in other countries.

GRADUAL PHASE-OUT

Saliba told a news conference that outlawing old chargers would have had a disproportionate impact on consumers and the environment, but noted that the change is expected to lead to a gradual phase-out of older products.

In total 13 categories of electronic devices will have to adapt by autumn 2024.

The Parliament extended the original proposal from the EU's executive Commission which covered only seven types of devices. Lawmakers also added laptops from 2026.

Apple has in the past warned that the proposal would hurt innovation and create a mountain of electronics waste.

The change had been discussed for years and was prompted by complaints from iPhone and Android users about having to switch to different chargers for their devices.

The European Commission has estimated that a single charger would save about 250 million euros ($247.3 million) for consumers.

Half the chargers sold with mobile phones in 2018 had a USB micro-B connector, while 29% had a USB-C connector and 21% a Lightning connector, which is used by Apple, a 2019 Commission study showed.

Apple is working on an iPhone with a USB-C charging port that could debut next year, Bloomberg reported in May.

The Commission has also been mandated by lawmakers to assess the possible regulation of wireless charging, but an EU official said no decision has been made yet, noting that the technology is not yet mature.

Summary Companies Taiwan's Foxconn 'cautiously optimistic' on Q4

Company reports record September, Q3 sales

Warns it still needs to monitor inflation, COVID-19















TAIPEI, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Taiwan's Foxconn (2317.TW), the world's largest contract electronics maker, said on Tuesday it was ""cautiously optimistic"" about its fourth-quarter revenue outlook after reporting record-breaking September sales.

Like other global manufacturers, the Taiwanese company, a major Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier, could be vulnerable to slowing consumer tech demand as the global economy faces the possibility of recession and inflation soars, especially in Europe and the United States.

But the company said in a statement it was ""cautiously optimistic"" about the outlook for the final three months of 2022, and maintained its full-year guidance of growth given in August, from previous guidance of flattish revenue.

""However, the dynamics of inflation, the pandemic, and the supply chain still need to be closely monitored,"" it said.

Formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, the company said revenue for September and the third quarter grew 40.39% and 24.4% on the year, respectively, both hitting record highs and beating its own expectations.

Revenue from smart consumer electronics, which includes its key smartphone business, showed strong double-digit growth in the third quarter, thanks to new product launches and ""smooth mass production"", it added.

Apple's new iPhone 14 went on sale last month.

The company, which has grappled with COVID-19 lockdowns and electricity rationing in China disrupting its supply chain, had previously forecast flat revenue growth for the third quarter for consumer electronics, including smartphones.

Revenue gained 13.66% in the first nine months of 2022, it said.

Analysts have said the popularity of new premium iPhones would boost Foxconn's business, while continued server demand from major clients, including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), would also counter industry headwinds as global tech demand slows.

The fourth quarter is traditionally the hot season for Taiwan's tech companies as they race to supply cellphones, tablets and other electronics for the year-end holiday period in Western markets.

Foxconn releases third-quarter earnings on Nov. 10.

Its shares closed up 1.5% on Tuesday, underperforming the benchmark index (.TWII), which gained 2.1%. Foxconn shares have dropped 1.4% this year, giving it a market value of $44.03 billion.

Summary Law firms

Law firms Related documents Apple accused of interrogating workers, barring union flyers

Complaint is labor board's first against Apple

Company is facing union campaigns in several cities















(Reuters) - Apple Inc has been accused by a U.S. labor board of illegally attempting to stymie a union campaign at a Manhattan retail store by interrogating workers and barring them from leaving pro-union flyers in a break room.

The complaint from the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) claims Apple asked employees at the World Trade Center store about their support for the union, forced them to attend anti-union meetings and prohibited flyers in a break room where it allowed other forms of solicitation.

The claims come as unions work to organize Apple employees at several U.S. stores. A store near Baltimore, Maryland in June became the first Apple location to unionize, and a vote will be held at an Oklahoma City store next week.

The complaint, which is dated Sept. 30, was spurred by charges that the Communication Workers of America (CWA) union filed with the agency in May.

Apple in a statement on Wednesday denied wrongdoing and said it values its retail workers.

""We regularly communicate with our teams and always want to ensure everyone's experience at Apple is the best it can be,"" the company said.

Sara Steffens, the CWA's secretary-treasurer, said the complaint would help hold Apple accountable for its alleged anti-union activities.

""Apple has a choice,"" Steffens said in a statement on Wednesday. ""Does it want to be known for intimidating its workers and creating a culture of fear, or does it want to live up to its stated values and welcome true collaboration with all of its employees?""

The union drive at Apple stores is part of a spike in union organizing that began during the COVID-19 pandemic. Amazon.com Inc and Starbucks Corp are among the other major companies that are facing the first union drives in their history.

The complaint against Apple seeks to require the company to post a notice at the store about workers' rights under federal law and train managers on their legal obligations.

A Dec. 23 hearing is scheduled in the case before an NLRB administrative judge. Apple has until Oct. 14 to file a response to the complaint.

The case is Apple Inc, National Labor Relations Board, No. 02-CA-295979.

Oct 5 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is asking its suppliers to move some AirPods and Beats headphone production to India for the first time, Nikkei reported on Wednesday, in what could be an another win for New Delhi in its push for local manufacturing.

Apple iPhone assembler Foxconn (2317.TW) is preparing to make Beats headphones in India and hopes to eventually produce AirPods in the country as well, the report said, citing sources.

Luxshare Precision Industry (002475.SZ), a Chinese supplier to the iPhone maker, and its units also plan to help Apple make AirPods in India, according to the report.

However, Luxshare is focusing more on its Vietnamese AirPods operations for now and could be slower than its competitors in starting meaningful production of Apple products in India, the Nikkei newspaper said.

466,616,APPLE,2022-10-05,Musk’s messy Twitter deal could have an X-factor,"













NEW YORK, Oct 5 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elon Musk’s $44 billion Twitter (TWTR.N) deal is a mess in the making. That’s true both for the Tesla (TSLA.O) chief, whose agreed price looks too rich amid a market crash, and for his bankers, who must pony up the debt. But combining Twitter with Musk’s other ventures could be a game-changer — if his attention doesn’t wander.

Hours after Musk offered to buy the social network, reviving a deal he’d previously tried to nix, he tweeted that Twitter could be “an accelerant to creating X, the everything app.” Such an app already exists, though not in Musk’s home market. China’s WeChat pulls together messaging, payments, lending, and its own app store. WeChat dominates China, where its “mini” apps underpin a $240 billion marketplace.

loading

But such apps haven’t taken off in the United States, where Apple’s iPhone holds over 50% market share, according to Counterpoint Research. Apple’s heft helps it corral users into its own services, like iMessage or Apple Pay. Even Meta Platforms’ (META.O) WhatsApp, a messaging service used by billions worldwide, draws only 17% of U.S. teens, according to Pew Research.

Musk has a couple of things even WeChat doesn’t have, though. For example: A rapidly growing global fleet of Tesla vehicles that could potentially create a new way into a Musk-app universe. Apple (AAPL.O) is investing in the idea of cars as a platform, via “Project Titan” and CarPlay, its vehicle operating system. General Motors (GM.N) and Ford Motor say electric cars can be a funnel for selling services. Musk’s Tesla is the runaway leader in electric cars; he even theorizes that it could evolve into a fleet of self-driving robotaxis.

Then there’s SpaceX, already partnering with wireless carrier T-Mobile US (TMUS.O) to provide coverage from its Starlink satellite system. Combining this telecom backbone with transportation and in-app communications becomes potentially more powerful still, and is something that’s easier to do as a part of a privately held corporate empire than a red-tape-bound listed company.

This is all pie in the sky for now, even if the Twitter takeover does actually close. Musk has a tendency to get distracted, lapsing back into follies like provoking the Securities and Exchange Commission or tweeting poop emojis. But if Tesla’s market capitalization of $735 billion shows anything, it’s that investors put enormous value on Musk’s ability to one day turn a pipe dream into reality.

CONTEXT NEWS

Elon Musk intends to complete his $44 billion acquisition of social network Twitter, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Oct. 4.

In a tweet later that day, the Tesla chief said that buying Twitter would accelerate the creation of X, an ""everything app.""

In July, Twitter sued Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery after he sought to terminate the transaction.

CPI median forecast +2.7% y/y (prior month +2.66%)















TAIPEI, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Taiwan's exports likely rose for the 27th straight month in September though at a slower pace than in August, amid fears of a global recession, uncertainties due to the Ukraine conflict, and COVID-19 flare-ups in China, according to a Reuters poll.

Taiwan, a global hub for chip production and a key supplier to Apple Inc (AAPL.O), is one of Asia's leading exporters of technology goods. The trade data is seen as an important gauge of world demand for tech gadgets.

Exports last month were estimated to have risen 1.5% from a year earlier, a Reuters poll of 19 analysts showed on Wednesday, slightly slower than the 2% rise in August. read more

The export forecasts varied widely between a contraction of 5.83% and expansion of 5.1%, reflecting uncertainties over the global economy, supply chain disruptions due to pandemic lockdowns and power shortages in China, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Taiwan's Finance Ministry has predicted September exports could be in a range of a 3% contraction to a 1% expansion from a year earlier.

Separately, the consumer price index was expected to have risen 2.7% in September from a year earlier, a faster rate than 2.66% in August.

The inflation data will be released on Thursday, followed by trade data on Friday.

Summary Companies Initial fine of 1.1 bln euros

Apple appeals French court decision















PARIS, Oct 6 (Reuters) - A French court on Thursday substantially lowered a fine against iPhone maker Apple Inc (AAPL.O) for alleged anti-competitive behaviour to 372 million euros ($366.31 million) from 1.1 billion euros previously, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

The original fine had been imposed by France's antitrust watchdog in 2020 for what it described as Apple's anti-competitive behaviour towards its distribution and retail network.

At the time, it was the biggest fine levied by the antitrust regulator, which said Apple imposed prices on retail premium resellers so that the prices were aligned with those charged by the California firm in its own shops, or on the internet.

The appeals court backed the antitrust watchdog's charge that Apple abused the retailers' economic dependency on the company but tossed the fixed-pricing charge, one of the two sources said.

It also reduced the time scope of the charge of an alleged restriction of the wholesalers' clientele, the same source said.

The court also decided to significantly lower the rate applied to calculate the overall fine, the source added.

The French antitrust authority had used a high rate in 2020 given the size and financial firepower of Apple, the source said.

Apple said it would appeal the decision. It did not mention the amount of the fine issued by the court.

""While the court correctly reversed part of the French Competition Authority's decision, we believe it should be overturned in full and plan to appeal,"" the U.S. company said in a statement sent to Reuters.

""The decision relates to practices from more than a decade ago that even the (French authority) recognised are no longer in use.""

A spokesperson for the appeals court declined to comment on the exact content of the decision but confirmed the court ""partially confirmed"" the antitrust watchdog's decision.

469,332,APPLE,2022-10-06,"Google's new Pixel Watch faces hurdles with economy, no iPhone support","













OAKLAND, Calif., Oct 6 (Reuters) - Google's debut smartwatch will go on sale Oct. 13 for $350, the Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) unit said on Thursday, taking on a field dominated by Apple Watch at a time when inflation-hammered consumers are shunning all forms of pricey wearables.

At $100 more than Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) lowest-cost model and limited to people with Android phones, the Google Pixel Watch faces enormous obstacles to adoption, market analysts say. Even sales of the Apple Watch have slipped this year as consumers delay purchases or select cheaper rivals.

""The market is not as robust as it once was,"" said Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager at market intelligence firm IDC, adding that aggressive discounting will be crucial to Google.

Google apps already work with watches from companies including Apple, Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS) and Fitbit, which Google bought last year and whose devices are known for tracking personal health.

The new round-faced Pixel Watch, made from stainless steel and glass with dozens of wristband options, enables contactless payments, music control and turn-by-turn directions. A model with cellular connectivity costs $50 more.

The watches will be sold in the United States and several other countries. They will not pair with iPhones because Apple gives its own watches exclusive access to messaging and other important features users would want, said Sandeep Waraich, a Google director of product management.

Hardware sales are a growing part of Google's sales, with benefits also coming through more opportunities to sell ads and services subscriptions.

Google also said its latest smartphones would go on sale in 17 countries starting Oct. 13. They include a $599 Pixel 7 with a 6.3-inch display and a shinier $899 7 Pro with a 6.7-inch display, further camera zoom and additional RAM.

Though a small player in smartphones overall, Google's sales are accelerating. It shipped 3 million phones in the first half of this year, up 131% on a year ago, according to tracking company Canalys.

REUTERS/Roselle Chen















Oct 6 (Reuters) - Facial recognition returned to the latest Google Pixel phones on Thursday after a short hiatus due to challenges on cost and performance, according to three former employees at the Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) unit knowledgeable about the efforts.

The feature on the new Pixel 7 is not as good Apple Inc's Face ID unlocking mechanism, as it can struggle in low light and is more vulnerable to being spoofed. In addition, Google has said it is not secure enough to enable signing into apps or making payments. read more

The return comes after Google became stricter about launching products with facial recognition, in part due to questions about its performance on darker skin. The company took time to review its approach to training and testing facial recognition since the previous Pixel with the capability launched in 2019, one of the sources said.

Google declined to comment on several specific questions about its history with face unlock. It said generally, ""Thanks to advanced machine learning models for face recognition, Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro feature Face Unlock, but we’re doing it a little differently."" It added, ""We achieve good facial accuracy performance with the front-facing camera.""

Google's pursuit of face unlock for Android smartphones spans at least a decade, but it came under greater pressure when Apple released Face ID in September 2017, the sources said.

To that point, Google struggled to devise a system that both performed quickly and was impervious to spoofing, or the use of photos or hyper-realistic costumes to fool someone else's phone into unlocking, one of the sources said. Engineers toyed with requiring a smile or a blink - proving a person's ""liveness"" - to combat spoofing but it was awkward and slow, the source said.

Another source noted that after the arrival of Apple's Face ID, which uses a depth-sensing and infrared camera called TrueDepth to map a face, Google executives signed off on a comparable technology. Google's Pixel 4, released in 2019, called its infrared depth-sensing setup uDepth.

It performed well, including in dark conditions, with no more than a 1-in-50,000 chance that it would unlock a phone for an unauthorized face, according to Google.

But the gear was expensive. And while Apple sells 240 million iPhones annually, Google has topped out at a few million, preventing it from buying parts at the volume discounts Apple does.

Google dropped uDepth in the Pixel 5 in 2020 due to costs, the sources said.

Face masking because of the pandemic gave Google reason to exclude the feature from last year's Pixel 6 and additional research time, two sources said.

Face unlock on the new phones relies on a typical front camera. But unlike the previous system, it cannot securely unlock apps and payments because Google says spoofing chances - such as by holding up a user's photo - are greater than 20%, above the 7% threshold it requires to be considered most ""secure.""

Low light and sunglasses also can cause trouble, Google says, noting fingerprint unlock remains an alternative.

471,794,APPLE,2022-10-07,California exotic dancers to vote over joining a union,"













NEW YORK, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Thirty exotic dancers at a topless bar in Hollywood, California are set to vote over whether to join the Actors Equity Association, and a majority ""yes"" vote would make them the only organized group of strippers in the United States.

Regulators from the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) set a vote date in a memo on Thursday.

Workers across industries and professions are increasingly seeking workplace protections and benefits through unions. From Amazon.com and Apple Inc to Starbucks Corp, unionization efforts are gaining momentum.

If the majority of the estimated 30 strippers vote to unionize, they will join the Actors Equity Association, a union that represents 51,000 professional actors and stage managers.

The Star Garden Topless Dive Bar dancers have picketed for months for better workplace conditions including better security and safer stages as well as higher compensation and access to benefits, according to Velveeta, a dancer at the bar who prefers to go by the stage name to avoid being blacklisted.

After initially presenting their petition to the club's owner, the women were denied access and could not return to work.

The owner of the Star Garden Bar could not be immediately reached for comment.

The owners of the bar argued at two hearings in September that they did not meet the gross revenue threshold of $500,000 to be under the jurisdiction of the NLRB.

The NLRB’s Los Angeles regional director issued a decision that the Star Garden did meet the board's standards for live entertainment venues and ordered a mail-in ballot election, according to the memo.

Ballots will be mailed to the dancers on October 14th and the ballot count will be held on November 7th.

Star Garden’s dancers are not the first strippers to seek union representation. Strippers at San Francisco’s Lusty Lady organized the Exotic Dancers Union in 1996 and were affiliated with the Service Employees International Union, according to the Actors' Equity Association.

The Lusty Lady closed in 2013.

TAIPEI, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Taiwan Economy Minister Wang Mei-hua will visit the United States next week to respond to what her office called ""concerns"" about supply chains and geopolitical issues and will also visit U.S. tech firms that are major customers of Taiwanese semiconductor companies.

A global semiconductor shortage has thrust chip powerhouse Taiwan into the spotlight and made supply chain management a bigger priority for governments around the world.

Taiwan's position as a major chip producer has prompted worries in the United States it is too reliant on the island, especially at a time when China is ramping up military drills to assert its sovereignty claims.

Wang's ministry said on Friday that she would leave on Sunday for a week-long trip to promote more frequent exchanges with the United States and cooperate on global business opportunities.

She will also go ""to respond to the concerns of sides about the recent supply chain resilience and geopolitical issues through interaction and exchanges on the U.S. side"", it added in a statement.

Wang will meet with U.S. companies and chambers of commerce on ways to strengthen supply chain cooperation, the ministry said.

""In addition, she will also visit industry giants headquartered in Silicon Valley and closely connected to Taiwan's semiconductor supply chain to have communications, continue to attract investment and consolidate Taiwan's supply chain security and resilience.""

The ministry did not name the companies she would visit or any U.S. officials she might meet, although it did say she would be in Washington on Oct. 12-14 for an exhibition on Taiwanese products.

Taiwan is home to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW), the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major supplier to companies including Apple Inc .

Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has said that the island is committed to ensuring its partners have reliable supplies of semiconductors and has urged allies to boost collaboration amid intensified threats from China.

But the government has also vowed to maintain Taiwan's dominant chip-making position.

NEW DELHI, Oct 11 (Reuters) - India's government will push Apple, Samsung and other mobile phone manufacturers to prioritise rolling out software upgrades to support 5G in the country, amid concerns that many of their models are not ready for the recently launched high-speed service.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched 5G services on Oct. 1 amid much fanfare, with leading telecom operator Reliance (RELI.NS) Jio saying it would make the service available in four cities and rival Bharti Airtel (BRTI.NS) in eight. Both companies said the service would be expanded next year.

But Apple's iPhone models, including the latest iPhone 14, and many of Samsung's premier phones do not have software compatible for supporting 5G in India, according to three industry sources and Airtel's website.

Concerned by this, top bureaucrats from India's telecoms and IT departments will chair a meeting on Wednesday for early 5G adoption, asking smartphone executives from foreign companies Apple, Samsung, Vivo and Xiaomi, as well as domestic telecom operators Reliance, Airtel and Vodafone Idea (VODA.NS) to be present, according to a government document seen by Reuters.

The agenda includes holding talks ""to prioritise"" and release software upgrades for supporting the high-speed network, the notice for the closed-door meeting stated.

Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), Vivo, Xiaomi Corp (1810.HK), as well as the three domestic telecom operators, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The government's IT and telecom departments also did not respond.

India has said that launch of 5G in the world's biggest mobile market - after China - will bring high-speed internet to consumers, with simultaneous socio-economic benefits in sectors like agriculture and health.

In August, Jio, India's biggest mobile carrier with more than 420 million customers, snapped up airwaves worth $11 billion in a $19 billion 5G spectrum auction. Airtel spent more than $5 billion, while Vodafone doled out above $2 billion.

While telecom players and smartphone companies have been holding discussions with each other, ironing out compatibility issues between the specific 5G technology of telecom companies in India and phone software is taking time, one of the industry sources said.

Airtel's website on Tuesday showed ""Apple yet to update software"" for all of Apple iPhones' 12 to 14 models under its 5G compatible section. For Samsung too, many models were not ready, Airtel stated, while more than three dozen models of China's Xiaomi and Vivo were shown as ready for use with its 5G service.

""Apple has been taking a lot of time. Airtel has been concerned about this as many of their premium clients are on Apple devices,"" said a second industry source with direct knowledge of the situation, who added Apple and Airtel have been holding talks.

A third source with direct knowledge of the issue said Apple was in the process of testing and validating different 5G offerings from network providers in India.

Lack of 5G software upgrades has already irked users.

On Sunday, the CEO of SoftBank-backed Indian digital payments firm Paytm (PAYT.NS), Vijay Shekhar Sharma, tagged Airtel in a tweet to say he bought a Google Pixel 6a phone only to use 5G, but it was not showing the network as an option in New Delhi. Later, he asked Google for a software upgrade in a tweet.

In response, a Twitter user, Mudit Mathur, posted screenshots showing his exchanges with Google Support team that told him the company was working with Indian telecom carriers to turn on 5G functionality on its phones ""as soon as possible"", targeting a December timeline.

Google did not respond to a request for comment.

475,136,APPLE,2022-10-11,"Some Apple workers in Australia vote to strike over pay, benefits","













SYDNEY, Oct 11 (Reuters) - A union representing Australian employees of iPhone maker Apple Inc (AAPL.O) voted to strike due to lack of progress on wage negotiations, a union official said on Tuesday.

The one-hour strike planned for Oct. 18 is set to disrupt the tech company's store operations in the country and add to the pressure it is facing elsewhere on industrial relations.

The planned strike will involve about 150 of Apple's 4,000 Australian employees who are represented by the Retail and Fast Food Workers Union (RAFFWU), restricting most customer services in at least three of the company's 22 stores in the country, the union said.

The strike would be the first for Apple in Australia, according to the RAFFWU, and widens the company's global exposure to collective bargaining just as soaring cost-of-living pressures prompt U.S. employees of Apple and other large firms like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) to unionise.

In Australia, Apple set off a round of union talks by proposing in August a new set of locked-in wage rises and conditions. The RAFFWU and two other unions went to an industrial arbiter in September seeking more time to negotiate, which was granted, the unions and Apple have said.

""We've come to the end of that today and we still aren't anywhere near a satisfactory agreement, so last night members unanimously endorsed that path,"" RAFFWU federal secretary Josh Cullinan told Reuters by phone.

""When large groups of workers walk off, that will have an impact.""

RAFFWU-represented workers in most Australian Apple stores would strike but the impact would be strongest in outlets with more representation, Cullinan said.

The three unions say they want Apple to guarantee wage increases that reflect inflation - which is tracking around 7% in Australia, double the central bank's target range - and weekends of two consecutive days rather than being split.

Apple says its minimum pay rates are 17% above the industry minimum and that full-time workers get guaranteed weekends.

""We are committed to providing the best possible experience (for our employees), including very strong compensation and benefits, annual stock grants and comprehensive leave policies, all of which exceed Australian industry standards,"" an Apple spokesperson said on Tuesday.

Summary Law firms

Law firms Related documents Intel accused Fortress of breaking antitrust law with patent aggregation, demands

Appeals court panel questioned whether Fortress' conduct amounts to antitrust violation















(Reuters) - A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals weighed dueling arguments Tuesday in Intel Corp's bid to revive its antitrust lawsuit against SoftBank-owned Fortress Investment Group LLC.

The panel voiced some skepticism of Intel's argument that Fortress and affiliated entities broke U.S. antitrust law by stockpiling patents and using them to extort tech companies.

VLSI Technology, which is owned by investment funds that Fortress manages, won $2.2 billion from Intel in a patent case in Texas last year and has other lawsuits pending against the chipmaker.

Intel and Apple Inc sued Fortress in 2019 for alleged antitrust violations based on its patent activities. Apple withdrew from the case last year, and U.S. District Judge Edward Chen dismissed the lawsuit months later.

Chen found that Intel had failed to show Fortress' patent aggregation had anti-competitive effects on pricing.

U.S. Circuit Judges Mary Schroeder, Johnnie Rawlinson and Daniel Bress on Tuesday grilled Intel attorney Seth Waxman of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr about his definition of ""pricing,"" which he said were the royalties that Fortress-related entities would demand to use the patented technology.

Rawlinson pressed Waxman for case precedent to support his argument and then asked if he was ""actually asking us to redefine 'price' for purposes of antitrust law.""

The judges also questioned Fortress attorney Morgan Chu of Irell & Manella about Intel's claim that Fortress had been able to unlawfully inflate its demands by aggregating potential ""substitute"" patents.

Chu told the court that Intel ""had three tries at pleading an antitrust case and has failed to do so.""

The case is Intel Corp v. Fortress Investment Group LLC, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-16817.

For Intel: Seth Waxman of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr

For Fortress: Morgan Chu of Irell & Manella

AMSTERDAM, Oct 11 (Reuters) - A group of European telecom regulators does not support the idea of having big tech firms such as Google and Netflix paying for telecommunications infrastructure, it said in initial findings published on Tuesday.

The findings by the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) come as the European Commission is debating whether internet platforms should be obliged to fund digital infrastructure such as 5G telecoms networks, given they make heavy use of it.

""BEREC has found no evidence that such (a direct compensation) method is justified given the current state of the market,"" the BEREC conclusions said.

The telecommunications industry has argued Google, Netflix, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple should pay for a ""fair share"" of telecom infrastructure as their services make up more than half of internet traffic.

However, digital rights groups fear that if the big tech firms fund infrastructure, they will also strike deals with telecom firms to give their own traffic preferential treatment, undermining the principle of net neutrality.

In a reaction to the BEREC findings, telecom lobby group ETNO - the European Telecommunications Network Operators, which represents Deutsche Telekom, Orange Group, Telefonica and others - rejected the BEREC findings as outdated and said it would submit new evidence to the Commission to support its position.

BEREC's findings said the internet had proved resilient to changing traffic patterns in the past and following ETNO's proposals ""could be of significant harm"".

EU industry chief Thierry Breton has said the European Union will review the matter early in 2023.

NEW DELHI, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) are among companies who will upgrade software for their 5G-enabled phones in India by December as authorities press mobile phone manufacturers to adopt the high-speed network.

Apple said it would push software upgrades to recent models, including the iPhone 14, 13, 12 and iPhone SE, which, industry sources say, do not yet support the network.

""We are working with our carrier partners in India to bring the best 5G experience to iPhone users as soon as network validation and testing for quality and performance is completed,"" Apple said in a statement on Wednesday.

""5G will be enabled via a software update and will start rolling out to iPhone users in December.""

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched 5G services on Oct. 1 amid much fanfare, with leading telecom operator Reliance Jio saying it would make the service available in four cities, while rival Bharti Airtel (BRTI.NS) targeted eight cities.

A Samsung India spokesperson said the company would roll out updates across all its 5G devices by mid-November.

Xiaomi India President Muralikrishnan B said their smartphones support Airtel 5G at present and by the end of this month most devices will start receiving updates for Jio 5G network support.

Meanwhile, Oppo India Vice President Tasleem Arif said the company will roll out 5G software upgrade on all compatible devices, which already support Airtel 5G, at the earliest.

The statements came after ministry of communications and ministry of electronics and IT officials held a meeting on Wednesday dedicated to 5G adoption, attended by executives from Apple, Samsung, Vivo and Xiaomi Corp (1810.HK), and telecom operators Reliance, Airtel and Vodafone Idea (VODA.NS). read more

479,487,APPLE,2022-10-12,Google approves Trump's Truth Social for Play Store,"













Oct 12 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google has approved former U.S. President Donald Trump's social media app Truth Social for distribution in the Google Play Store, a company spokesperson said on Wednesday.

Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), which operates Truth Social, is expected to make the app available in the Play Store shortly, Google said.

""It's been a pleasure to work with Google, and we're glad they helped us to finally bring Truth Social to all Americans, regardless of what device they use,"" TMTG's Chief Executive Officer Devin Nunes said in a statement.

Truth Social, which launched in the United States in the Apple App Store in February, had not previously been available in the Play Store due to insufficient content moderation, according to a Google spokesperson in August. Google had expressed concerns to Truth Social about violations of its Play Store policies prohibiting content like physical threats and incitement to violence.

Without Google and Apple stores, there is no easy way for most smartphone users to download Truth Social.

Google's Play Store is the main way users of Android phones in the United States download apps. Android users can get apps through competing stores or download them directly from a website, though it often requires extra steps and security permissions. Truth Social has been available through those means even as Google blocked it from the Play Store.

Android phones comprise about 40% of the U.S. smartphone market.

Truth Social restored Trump's presence on social media more than a year after he was banned from Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), Facebook (META.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O)'s YouTube following the Jan. 6, 2021 U.S. Capitol riots, after he was accused of posting messages inciting violence.

TMTG has pledged to deliver an ""engaging and censorship-free experience"" on Truth Social, appealing to a base that feels its views around such hot-button topics such as the outcome of the 2020 presidential election have been scrubbed from mainstream tech platforms.

News of Google's approval was first reported by Axios.

480,584,APPLE,2022-10-13,Big Tech's hiring freeze unlocks rich talent pool for U.S. startups,"













Oct 13 (Reuters) - Late-stage U.S. startups are scooping up talent unlocked by layoffs and hiring freezes at Big Tech, adding experienced engineers and project managers to their roster despite signs of an economic slowdown.

Companies, with steady cash flow from viable products in the market, are offering rich pay checks to lure talent that would have otherwise preferred working at big technology firms including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Facebook-parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O).

Stack Overflow Chief Executive Prashanth Chandrasekar said the coding platform's headcount had more than doubled this year to 540, with some of the new hires being tapped from firms such as Alphabet Inc-owned (GOOGL.O) Google and Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

""When competitors downsize, other talented people who are employed there may consider looking elsewhere, as they may not see their company as being stable,"" Chandrasekar said.

Deepak Rao, CEO of X1 Card, said the credit-card startup's headcount had more than doubled to 35 in a year and more employees from larger companies would join it in the coming months.

Google, Apple, Microsoft and Meta and did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The hiring spree comes even as startup funding is drying up in the face of decades-high inflation, a stronger dollar and massive rate hikes, which have pushed Big Tech to pull back on their spending spree.

According to GlobalData, venture capital funding raised by U.S. startups fell by nearly a third to $146.3 billion in the first eight months of 2022.

""Tech startups reliant on ongoing VC funding have cut back on hiring, but companies in the later funding stages with viable products in the market are faring much better,"" said Patrick McAdams, CEO of recruiting firm Andiamo.

""These companies have continued to hire strategically and are now able to take advantage of a softening tech hiring market to make key hires that were nearly impossible this time last year (when the pandemic drove up demand for tech workers).""

A survey of 581 executives, almost entirely from U.S. tech startups, showed that more than 40% of them boosted their hiring plans in the first half of 2022, according to hiring firm A.Team and startup consultant MassChallenge.

Companies are also shortening hiring times and offering higher pay packages to lock in candidates as they compete for talent in a tight labor market, recruiters said.

A greater say in decision making provided by startups has also appealed to executives such as Mansoor Basha, who joined Stagwell (STGW.O), a $2.2 billion marketing firm, as technology chief in September from Accenture .

""An opportunity to make key decisions internally was important for me,"" he said.

Still, some analysts warn there is only so long until startups can continue the hiring pace amid a weak economic backdrop.

""If the economy does indeed go into recession, it will only add to the pressure faced by tech firms as demand dries up,"" says Dante DeAntonio, director of economics research at Moody's Analytics.

The Sao Paulo state court ruled against Apple in a lawsuit, filed by the association of borrowers, consumers and taxpayers, that argued that the company commits abusive practices by selling its flagship product without a charger.

Apple said it will appeal the decision.

Previously, the tech firm argued that the practice had the purpose of reducing carbon emissions.

Shares in Asia's biggest company by market capitalisation closed up 4%, helping the broader market rise 2.5%.

The stock has lost a third of its value for the year to date, hurt by concerns about weakening global demand for consumer electronics amid decades-high inflation, rising interest rates and COVID-19 lockdowns in China.

Daiwa Capital Markets noted that guidance for the fourth quarter and next year was mostly ""intact"" and recommended that investors should take advantage of a buying opportunity. TSMC shares have fallen more than 30% so far this year

Morningstar said in a research note that TSMC shares were cheap given the long-term outlook for chips, especially as growth for artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and high-performance computing ""may last for decades"".

Summary Related documents D.C. federal judge approves deal resolving privacy claims

Incentive payments to plaintiffs in sharp focus in recent cases















(Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday said she will slash thousands of dollars in proposed ""incentive"" awards for plaintiffs who settled data-breach claims against the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, as the court prepares to issue a final order approving the $63 million deal.

U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington, D.C., at a hearing said she will approve a ""nominal"" amount of $1,000 for 36 named plaintiffs who led the privacy case against the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the primary human resources agency in the federal government.

The plaintiffs' attorneys had argued for $5,000 payments for a total of $180,000.

The legality of incentive awards, which are payments to plaintiffs who played key roles in litigation, have come into sharp focus in several recent big cases. A federal appeals court in 2020 said a winning plaintiff suing on behalf of a class can recover legal fees and expenses but nothing more.

Incentive awards recognize the time a plaintiff has dedicated to a case and the risk of being involved.

Jackson said the plaintiffs in the OPM data breach litigation had not been deposed or required to attend numerous court hearings. ""We never got into the factual issues at all,"" Jackson said.

The OPM settlement resolves allegations against the agency that a systems breach in 2015 compromised sensitive information of millions of current and former U.S. employees.

The Justice Department supported the settlement amount but objected to the $180,000 in incentive awards.

The government acknowledged that incentive awards ""are often reflexively"" approved but also pointed out that some courts have expressed concern ""because they represent a bounty that plaintiffs may expect simply for bringing suit.""

A Justice Department spokesperson on Friday did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

Plaintiffs' attorney Daniel Girard of Girard Sharp said “the court recognized their clients' commitment and contributions to this case.""

In a recent case involving an Apple Inc settlement, the plaintiffs' lawyers sought $3,500 for each of the nine named plaintiffs who were deposed and $1,500 for other plaintiffs.

A panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered a new look at the settlement but noted in its ruling that incentive awards are lawful.

Such ""awards cannot categorically be rejected or approved,"" Circuit Judge Jacqueline Nguyen wrote for the 9th Circuit panel in the Apple case. ""So long as they are reasonable, they can be awarded.""

The 9th Circuit's view contrasted with an 11th Circuit ruling in 2020 that said two late 19th century U.S. Supreme Court decisions prohibited awards to lead class representatives.

The case is In re: Office of Personnel Management Data Security Breach Litigation, U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, No. 1:15-mc-01394-ABJ.

BENGALURU, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Indian telecom service provider Reliance Jio has chosen Nokia (NOKIA.HE) as a major supplier, the Finnish telecom equipment maker said on Monday, as India's biggest mobile carrier gears up to expand next-generation wireless services across the country.

Nokia will supply Reliance Jio, which has more than 420 million customers, with 5G radio access network (RAN) equipment in a multi-year deal, the company said in a statement.

""Nokia will supply equipment from its AirScale portfolio, including base stations, high-capacity 5G Massive MIMO antennas, and Remote Radio Heads to support different spectrum bands, and self-organizing network software,"" it said.

5G data speeds in India are expected to be about 10 times faster than those of 4G, with the network seen as vital for emerging technologies like self-driving cars and artificial intelligence.

Reliance (RELI.NS) snapped up airwaves worth $11 billion in a $19 billion 5G spectrum auction in August and had launched 5G services in select cities. It is also working with Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google to launch a budget 5G smartphone.

As India's telecom service providers roll out 5G services, the government is also pushing top mobile phone manufacturers, like Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Samsung (005930.KS) and others, to prioritise rolling out software upgrades to support 5G, amid concerns that many of their models are not ready for the high-speed service. read more

The Reliance-Nokia deal comes at a time when some governments, including India, have either banned or discouraged the use of China's Huawei in national networks.

""Jio is committed to continuously investing in the latest network technologies to enhance the experience of all of its customers,"" Akash Ambani, chairman of Reliance Jio, said.

Meanwhile, Reliance Jio is planning to raise an additional $1.5 billion via external commercial borrowings to fund its 5G capital expenditure plans, the Economic Times newspaper reported, citing sources.

Oct 17 (Reuters) - U.S. tech giant Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has put on hold plans to use memory chips from China's Yangtze Memory Technologies Co (YMTC) in its products, after Washington imposed tighter export controls against Chinese technology companies, the Nikkei reported on Monday.

Apple had originally planned to start using state-funded YMTC's NAND flash memory chips as early as this year, Nikkei said, citing people familiar with the matter. The chips were initially planned to be used only for iPhones sold in the Chinese market.

The company was considering eventually purchasing up to 40% of the chips needed for all iPhones from YMTC, the newspaper said.

Analysts believe that YMTC is among the smaller companies that provide memory chips to Apple and it will see little to no effect by the move.

However, CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said that the bigger implication is that it limits Apple from potentially further diversifying its supplier base by utilizing domestic China players and improving its cost profile over time.

Apple is moving a greater amount of production to Vietnam and India to make products like the Airpods and new iPhones. read more read more

Shares of the iPhone-maker rose 1.6% to $140.59 in trading before the bell amid broader market gains.

The United States last week added China's top memory chipmaker YMTC and 30 other Chinese entities to a list of companies that U.S. officials have been unable to inspect, ratcheting up tensions with Beijing, starting a 60 day-clock that could trigger much tougher penalties.

Biden administration's sweeping set of export controls on China is a bid to slow Beijing's technological and military advances by cutting the country's supplies off from certain semiconductor chips made anywhere in the world with U.S. equipment.

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, while YMTC declined to comment.

486,521,APPLE,2022-10-18,Explainer: Parler: what is the social media app Kanye West is buying?,"













Oct 18 (Reuters) - U.S. rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye, has agreed in principle to buy social media platform Parler, which is popular among U.S. conservatives, the app's parent company said on Monday.

Ye's offer comes after the artist was locked out of his Twitter (TWTR.N) and Instagram accounts this month for making posts that online users condemned as anti-Semitic.

Here is what you need to know about the social media platform.

WHAT IS PARLER?

Parler was founded in 2018 as a self-styled free speech platform. Its hands-off approach to content moderation has made it popular among U.S. conservatives who disagree with content limits on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.

However, Parler's less stringent rules have gotten it into trouble with tech giants. After the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump, Apple Inc.(AAPL.O) and Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O) took Parler off their app stores, saying the company had not taken adequate measures to prevent posts inciting violence. Amazon.com Inc also temporarily stopped hosting the platform, effectively taking it offline.

Apple and Google have both allowed Parler back on their platforms after the app undertook content moderation measures, including features to block abusive users and remove content that could incite violence.

WHY IS KANYE WEST BUYING PARLER?

Ye's offer to buy Parler comes in response to his suspension from larger platforms. He believes Parler is a place for people like him who cannot express themselves on other sites, Ye told Bloomberg.

""In a world where conservative opinions are considered to be controversial we have to make sure we have the right to freely express ourselves,"" said Ye in a statement.

Ye's move comes as others includingTrump and Tesla (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk have turned to social media ownership to combat censorship on prominent social media networks. Musk is in negotiations to buy Twitter and Trump started his own network called Truth Social.

WHO OWNS PARLER?

Parler is owned by Parlement Technologies Inc, created last month as part of a larger overhaul to focus on customers who risk being pushed off the internet.

Parlement's CEO is George Farmer, an active financial supporter of Britain's Brexit Party. Farmer is also married to Candace Owens, a prominent conservative commentator and Trump ally.

WHAT IS PARLER WORTH AND WHEN WILL THE DEAL CLOSE?

Parler did not give a deal value, but the Nashville-based company has raised about $56 million to date. It expects the deal to close during the fourth quarter of 2022.

Farmer declined to comment on whether the deal includes a break-up fee if either party terminates it.

487,69,APPLE,2022-10-18,Apple cuts production of iPhone 14 Plus - the Information,"













Oct 18 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is cutting production of iPhone 14 Plus within weeks of starting shipments as it re-evaluates demand for the mid-range model, the Information reported on Tuesday, citing two people involved in the company's supply chain.

The Cupertino, California-based company told at least one manufacturer in China to immediately halt production of iPhone 14 Plus components, according to the report.

The move comes at a time when the global smartphone market has been softening, shrinking 9% in the third quarter compared with the same period a year earlier, according to estimates from data research firm Canalys, which expects weak demand over the next six to nine months.

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The iPhone 14 Plus, part of a new lineup announced on Sept. 7, is positioned as a cheaper alternative to its more expensive iPhone Pro models and started being shipped to customers on Oct. 7.

Last month, Apple dropped its plan to increase production of the new iPhone models as an anticipated surge in demand failed to materialize, according to a Bloomberg News report.

488,496,APPLE,2022-10-19,Tesla seeks to ease demand concerns over likely 2022 delivery target miss,"













Oct 20 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) said on Wednesday it expected to miss its vehicle delivery target this year, but downplayed concerns about softening demand after its revenue missed Wall Street estimates.

Chief Executive Elon Musk told analysts on a conference call there was excellent demand in the fourth quarter, addressing investors' concerns that buyers could be discouraged by the weak global economy and high prices for Tesla vehicles.

But Tesla said some logistics challenges would persist, with fourth-quarter deliveries growing by less than 50% while production rose 50%.

""I wouldn't say we're recession proof, but it's certainly recession resilient,"" Musk said.

Previously, Tesla had repeatedly said it was aiming for 50% growth this year from the 936,172 cars it delivered in 2021.

Its shares were down nearly 6% in after-market trading.

Tesla is expanding fast despite global economic jitters, and investors are closely watching for signs that consumer demand is cooling as inflation surges and interest rates climb.

""This quarter was not rainbows and roses and it leaves investors wanting more from Tesla which is held to a higher standard than every other automaker,"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a client note.

""Tesla must now prove again to the Street that the robust growth story is running into a myriad of logistics issues as opposed to demand softening with EV competition coming all angles around the globe.""

The electric carmaker's third-quarter automotive gross margin was 27.9%, missing analysts' estimates and down from 30.5% a year earlier.

Revenue for the third quarter was $21.45 billion, a record but short of analysts' estimates of $21.96 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The company said it had a negative foreign exchange impact of $250 million on its earnings as the U.S. dollar strengthened against other major currencies.

""Raw material cost inflation impacted our profitability along with ramp inefficiencies"" from its new factories in Berlin and Texas, and the production of its new 4680 batteries, according to Tesla's statement. Musk added that production of the 4680 battery was gaining rapid traction, although executive Andrew Baglino said, ""There are challenges still ahead that we have not yet surpassed. No doubt.""

Musk added that Tesla's Semi trucks, which would start to be delivered to customers beginning this December, will not use the 4680 battery cells.

Musk also said the company has the ability to do a stock buyback in the range of $5 billion to $10 billion, pending board review and approval.

PATH TO PASS APPLE MARKET SHARE

Early this month, Tesla said it delivered 35% more vehicles in the July-September period than in the previous quarter, thanks in part to a rebound in China output after lengthy COVID-19 disruptions, but the record number was shy of vehicle production and analysts' estimates.

The electric vehicle pioneer has seen its shares tumble about 50% from record highs last November as investors were spooked by fears of a global economic slowdown and Musk's bid to buy social media company Twitter (TWTR.N).

Musk told the conference call he saw a path for Tesla to be worth more than two mammoth companies, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Saudi Aramco (2222.SE), combined. Tesla's market cap is now under $700 billion, while Apple is worth $2.3 trillion and oil producer Saudi Aramco is worth $2.1 trillion.

Analysts had expected Musk to voice optimism about Tesla in the conference call. Musk has been trying to raise cash to fund his $44 billion deal to take Twitter Inc private. Some experts say Musk may need to sell about $3 billion more in stock after the earnings announcement to help fund the deal.

Musk on Wednesday said he was excited about his pending acquisition of Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), though he said he and other investors were overpaying for the social media company.

Musk also said Tesla's Cybertruck pick-up truck was on track to enter production in the middle of next year and its heavy duty semi truck could see 50,000 units in North America in 2024.

489,809,APPLE,2022-10-19,Digital ad market shows 'signs of life' but economy clouds 2023 outlook,"[1/3] A woman stands in front of the logo of Snap Inc on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, NY, U.S. March 2, 2017. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson















Oct 19 (Reuters) - When Snap Inc (SNAP.N) kicks off the third-quarter earnings season for tech and social media companies on Thursday, investors are expecting modest revenue growth across most of the sector as results will be compared with a difficult 2021 when Apple Inc (AAPL.O) privacy changes began to upend the advertising industry.

But a possible recession next year makes forecasting 2023 financials a guess at best, say some analysts, while investors are wary of reading too deeply into ""signs of life"" like ad spending around the fall shopping season as indicators of future performance.

The challenging outlook follows a period in which record-high inflation and global geopolitical uncertainty from the war in Ukraine and U.S.-China tensions have led companies to slash marketing budgets. This has hurt tech platforms that earn the bulk of revenue by selling digital ads and has led to cost-cutting to preserve profitability.

""Overall, we believe the online ad environment remains choppy, with continued volatility week by week,"" JP Morgan analysts wrote in a note to clients on Oct. 4.

Tech companies have taken steps to prepare for the worst through cost cuts, halting hiring, reining in employee perks and focusing on profitable projects. That has helped reassure Wall Street in the short term, some analysts said.

On Thursday, Snap is expected to report 6% growth in revenue to $1.13 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. This would represent the slowest-ever quarterly revenue growth for Snap as a public company.

The Snapchat owner is often the first to report quarterly earnings and serves as a bellwether for the social media sector. Snap shares are down 77% so far this year.

The company announced in August that it would lay off 20% of its staff and cut money-losing projects, blaming a deteriorating economy. read more

Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, the world's largest digital ad platform by market share, has fared relatively well due to the necessity of Google Search ads for brands.

Its wealth of data for advertising and reliance on search-based ads have shielded the company from the impact of privacy changes that Apple introduced last year on iPhones, which made it more difficult for platforms and brands to collect user data for personalized ads.

Wall Street is expecting Alphabet to report the highest growth of the Big Tech companies with an increase of 7.5% in ad revenue compared with last year.

CHALLENGES AHEAD

Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) has been hurt by those changes, on the other hand, and investors will be scrutinizing the company's results for evidence of improving user engagement with Facebook and Instagram and more brands buying adds on newer features like TikTok competitor Reels, said analysts.

Analysts on average expect Meta to report a 4.5% decline in ad revenue, which would be the company's second straight quarter of decline, according to Refinitiv data.

Shares of Meta are down 60% so far this year, hurt by fierce competition from short-form video app TikTok, and by its own expensive investment in building the metaverse and ads that are now less effective due to Apple's privacy changes.

""The company now known as Meta is a far cry from Facebook one year ago,"" said Debra Williamson, principal analyst at research firm Insider Intelligence. ""After a dismal earnings report in Q2, we aren't expecting Q3 to be any better. It's very possible it will be much worse.""

Ads from large retailers promoting back-to-school and fall shopping are expected to help lead to growth at digital pinboard platform Pinterest Inc (PINS.N), said analysts at Bernstein in a note on Monday. Wall Street is expecting revenue to grow 5% from the prior-year quarter.

However, some advertisers are shifting ad dollars to larger platforms that are used by more people and which have been proven to deliver sales results, said Credit Suisse analysts, which poses a risk to Pinterest's revenue in the fourth quarter and next year.

Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), which is working to close a deal to be acquired by billionaire Elon Musk, has not yet announced a date to report third-quarter earnings.

Twitter's results are unlikely to affect its share price, which is trading on the likelihood of the Musk deal closing. But the third-quarter results could be hurt by marketers spending less on ""brand ads"" that build name recognition, which constitutes most of Twitter's business, said Bernstein analysts.

Snap and Meta have become more known for so-called performance ads, which are used to drive sales or website visits.

490,703,APPLE,2022-10-19,Musk says excited by Twitter deal despite overpaying,"













OAKLAND, Calif., Oct 19 (Reuters) - Elon Musk on Wednesday said he was excited about his pending acquisition of Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), although he and other investors were overpaying for the social media company.

Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, was answering a question during a call after the electric vehicle maker's quarterly report. The world's richest person is pursuing the Twitter purchase after earlier trying to back out of the $44 billion deal.

Musk described Twitter as an asset that had ""languished"" for a long time. ""Myself and the other investors are obviously overpaying for Twitter right now. The long term potential for Twitter in my view is an order of magnitude greater than its current value,"" he said.

In the same conference call Musk also spoke optimistically about Tesla. Tesla, with a market cap now under $700 billion, could be worth more than the combined value of Apple Inc's $2.3 trillion and oil producer Saudi Aramco's $2.1 trillion, he said.

Musk has been trying to raise cash to fund the Twitter purchase, and some experts say he may need to sell about $3 billion more in stock after the Tesla quarterly report to do so.

A Delaware judge ordered a pause to Twitter Inc's (TWTR.N) lawsuit against Elon Musk, giving the billionaire until Oct. 28 to close the deal.

Tesla investors feared that the billionaire may sell more Tesla stocks to finance the deal and may be spreading himself too thin, pulling down shares.

Musk, CEO of SpaceX, and Neuralink and Boring Company, said on Wednesday that he does not have a current plan to combine them with Twitter under one umbrella.

491,22,APPLE,2022-10-19,Tesla’s Apple-sized goals have cash risks,"













NEW YORK, Oct 19 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Shares of electric-vehicle leader Tesla (TSLA.O), after sliding 45% this year, look reasonably priced — if promises of iPhone-like industry dominance come true. A wrinkle in this quarter’s results, though, points to potentially flagging demand. Returning cash to shareholders only works if the Austin, Texas-based company's Apple-sized (AAPL.O) dreams become reality.

On Wednesday, Tesla reported third-quarter revenue of over $21 billion, up 56% year-over-year. Even after hiking prices, it delivered 42% more cars to customers. Boss Elon Musk says the carmaker can grow that number at the rate of 50% annually until hitting 20 million in 2030. After last quarter’s supply-chain-driven slowdown threatened progress, it is almost back on track.

Tesla’s 17% operating margin beats the gas-guzzler businesses of rivals Ford Motor (F.N) and General Motors (GM.N) — whose EVs are less profitable still. As a result, its cars resemble Apple’s iPhone. Per Counterpoint Research, the Cupertino-based company accounts for an overwhelming majority of smartphone industry profits; Tesla can make the same claim for the EV industry.

The market seems to be trusting that, like Apple, Tesla can beat its doubters, maintain profitability, and at least come close to its 2030 goal. Assume it does so, and that revenue per car comes in at around $45,000 while operating margins at its core operations hold at 15%. Put the resulting operating income on Ford’s multiple, discount it back at a rate of 10%, and the company’s shares should be worth $249, just above Wednesday's closing price of $222.

In that sense, Tesla’s $700 billion valuation is reasonable. But there are wrinkles. The company delivered 6% fewer cars than it made this quarter, the widest gap ever in absolute terms, which it blames on shipping woes. The worry is the gap instead indicates flagging demand growth.

Apple faced a similarly tense moment of shrinking profits and growth in 2013. Investors like David Einhorn and Carl Icahn demanded it use its cash pile to buy back sagging shares, and that bet paid off. With its stock price declining, it would make sense for Tesla to feel the same pressures to pull that lever now.

But Apple started 2013 with $137 billion in cash and marketable securities; Tesla has $21 billion. It also has significant cash demands. Capital expenditures this year should equal about 34% of that pile, versus 6% at Apple.

Musk has shown that he deserves the benefit of the doubt when it comes to manufacturing cars. When it comes to paying dividends, though, tossing back cash to shareholders is a risk.

492,519,APPLE,2022-10-20,Amazon faces $1 bln lawsuit in UK for 'favouring its own products',"Summary

Summary Companies Consumer rights advocate bringing case for customers

Amazon says collective action is 'without merit'

Case focuses on marketplace's 'Buy Box' feature















LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) is facing a lawsuit in Britain for damages of up to 900 million pounds ($1 billion) over allegations the online marketplace abused its dominant position by favouring its own products, lawyers said.

Consumer rights advocate Julie Hunter plans to bring the collective action on behalf of British consumers who have made purchases on Amazon since October 2016, lawyers representing her said.

The proposed case - which Amazon said was ""without merit"" - would be the latest mass action against a tech giant to be filed at London’s Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT).

Law firm Hausfeld, which represents Hunter, said on Thursday that Amazon has breached competition law by using “a secretive and self-favouring algorithm” to promote its own products through the “Buy Box” feature on its website.

Hunter said in a statement: “Far from being a recommendation based on price or quality, the Buy Box favours products sold by Amazon itself, or by retailers who pay Amazon for handling their logistics. Other sellers, however good their offers might be, are effectively shut out.”

An Amazon spokesperson said in a statement: “This claim is without merit and we’re confident that will become clear through the legal process.”

The lawsuit is expected to be filed at the CAT by the end of this month and will have to be certified by the tribunal before it can proceed.

It is being brought on an “opt-out” basis, meaning that any potential claimants will be included in the claim unless they choose to opt out.

The case follows the announcement by Britain’s antitrust watchdog in July that it is investigating Amazon over suspected breaches of competition law, including how it selects which products are placed within the “Buy Box” feature.

Amazon has faced similar probes elsewhere, recently making an offer to the European Commission to avert possible hefty EU antitrust fines.

The platform has also declined to describe its product-search system to an Australian competition regulator which has heard complaints of large marketplace platforms giving preference to in-house wares.

The CAT authorised an estimated 920 milion-pound ($1.1 billion) damages claim against Google (GOOGL.O) in July and approved another case worth up to 1.7 billion pounds against Apple (AAPL.O) in May.

The tribunal is also due to decide in January whether to give the go-ahead to a claim valued at up to 2.2 billion pounds against Meta Platforms (META.O), the owner of Facebook and Instagram, over alleged anti-competitive behaviour.

Google and Apple deny the allegations against them, according to court filings, and Meta did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

493,4,APPLE,2022-10-20,Apple lawsuits say health monitoring company Masimo copied Apple Watch,"Summary

Summary Related documents Masimo earlier accused Apple Watches of copying its own technology

New Apple patent lawsuits say Masimo copied tech while seeking to ban competition















(Reuters) - Apple Inc sued medical technology company Masimo Corp in Delaware federal court on Thursday, accusing its new W1 line of smartwatches of infringing several Apple Watch patents.

The two lawsuits said Masimo copied Apple's technology while seeking bans on sales and imports of Apple Watches in earlier intellectual-property cases against the tech giant in California and at a U.S. trade tribunal. Apple said Masimo ""carefully studied Apple's IP"" during those cases and claimed a Masimo spinoff received confidential information about the Apple Watch.

Apple accused Masimo of trying to use the litigation to remove Apple's watches from the market to ""make way for Masimo's own watch.""

Irvine, California-based Masimo said in a statement that Apple's lawsuits are ""retaliatory"" and ""appear to be an attempt to avoid the court in which the parties have been litigating their dispute for the past three years.""

Masimo, which specializes in health-monitoring devices for medical patients, sued Apple in California federal court in 2020.

The company said it met with Apple about integrating its technology into Apple products in 2013, and that Apple later hired away several of its employees. It accused Apple of infringing patents and stealing trade secrets related to the use of light sensors to measure biomarkers like heart rates and blood-oxygen levels.

Masimo also filed a complaint against Apple at the U.S. International Trade Commission last year over Apple Watch imports that allegedly violate its patent rights. Both of those cases are still ongoing.

Apple countered in its new lawsuits that Masimo, which it said has ""never been in the consumer wearables business,"" mimicked its technology to create the W1 line of smartwatches Masimo launched earlier this year.

""Masimo, while trying to block importation or sale of Apple Watch, was also secretly copying it,"" Apple said.

""By launching a device that copies Apple Watch and infringes our intellectual property, Masimo attempted to take advantage of our teams' many innovations,"" the company said in a statement.

The lawsuit accuses Masimo of infringing six patents covering smartwatch and health-monitoring technology, as well as four patents covering design elements of Apple Watches and chargers.

The cases are Apple Inc v. Masimo Corp, U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, Nos. 1:22-cv-01377 and 1:22-cv-01378.

494,383,APPLE,2022-10-21,Wall Street Week Ahead: Megacap earnings to test fledgling U.S. stock rebound,"













NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Earnings reports from the four biggest U.S. companies by market capitalization in the coming week may test a nascent rally that has seen stocks claw their way back from yet another low.

Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) account for a combined 20% of the weight of the S&P 500 (.SPX) and more than a third of the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC).

Investors view the growth giants as bellwethers for how corporate America is faring during a year in which inflation has soared, pushing the Federal Reserve to quickly enact a series of jumbo-sized rate hikes that bruised markets and raised fears a recession may be coming.

“If these megacaps can’t do well, then the question is: who can do well?” said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at BMO Wealth Management.

Top stocks' market value as percentage of S&P 500

The S&P 500 is up nearly 5% from its Oct 12 closing low for the year after posting its biggest weekly gain since late June. Even with stocks' latest rebound, the index has dropped 21% so far in 2022, on track for its biggest decline since 2008.

Resilient corporate profits have been one bright spot this year, though doubts are growing over how sustainable they will be. With the bulk of S&P 500 companies still to report, third-quarter profits are estimated to have climbed 3.1% versus the year-ago period, which would be the weakest performance in two years, according to Refinitiv IBES, while earnings growth expectations for 2023 have fallen to 7.2% from 7.8% on Oct 1.

Next week's reports from the four megacaps may show whether companies with dominant positions can post solid performance despite worries of a potential economic downturn.

Because of their heavy weightings, ""if those stocks don’t get it done, that puts pressure on the indices to continue to go down,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services.

Microsoft and Alphabet are due to report on Tuesday, with Amazon and Apple set for Thursday.

Apple shares are the only ones of the megacaps that have outperformed the broader market this year. Shares of the iPhone maker, which account for a 7% weight in S&P 500, are down about 17% in 2022; Microsoft and Amazon are each off roughly 28%, Alphabet is down 30%.

Reuters Graphics

Despite those steep losses, investors have maintained exposure to the megacap stocks. Actively managed U.S. mutual and exchange-traded funds held 11.41% of their portfolios in those four stocks combined as of the most recently available data, versus 11.44% at the end of 2021, according to Morningstar Direct.

Investors have been drawn to the large companies broadly because of their financial strength and competitive advantages that, in theory, will drive profits even during uncertain economic times.

Still, only Apple has topped analyst estimates for earnings and revenue in both of their most recent quarterly reports, according to Refinitiv data.

""The bar is higher for Apple because it has outperformed and because you haven’t seen the earnings blink yet,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital.

Questions loom over the other companies' key market areas, including personal computers for Microsoft, advertising spending for Alphabet and consumer strength for Amazon.

All three rely on cloud computing businesses, which will be in focus next week, according to Charlie Ryan, partner and portfolio manager at Evercore Wealth Management.

“Cloud would be the pillar that one would put their hopes on when they report,” Ryan said. “It has been continued strength for quite some time now and any deviation from that would be a concern.”

Meanwhile, soaring U.S. bond yields are pressuring valuations and complicating the picture for tech and other growth stocks, whose expected future earnings are discounted steeply by higher yields. Yields continued to rise this week, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note hitting a fresh 14-year high.

All four stocks command higher valuations than the S&P 500, which trades at nearly 16 times forward earnings estimates. The P/Es for Apple and Microsoft are both about 22 times, Alphabet trades at 17.5 times, while Amazon sits at 60 times, according to Refinitiv Datastream.

“Those stocks have typically sold at earnings multiples that are on the higher side,” said Carlson, of Horizon Investment Services.“How they are going to continue to perform from here gives some insight into what investors are ultimately willing to pay for growth stocks.”

Oct 21 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) vice president for industrial design, Evans Hankey, is leaving the company, Bloomberg News reported on Friday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

Hankey's departure was announced inside the Cupertino, California-based firm this week, with Hankey telling colleagues that she will remain at Apple for the next six months, according to the report, which added that a replacement has not been named so far. (https://bloom.bg/3gtu7k9)

She took over the role in 2019 after famed Apple designer Jony Ive moved out. Apple launched iPhone 12 through iPhone 14 models and M1 MacBooks while Hankey headed industrial design.

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Hankey's exit comes as Apple pushes forward on work on new devices, including mixed reality headsets, and potentially an electric car that is expected to be produced many years down the line.

Oct 21 (Reuters) - Taiwan electronics manufacturer Foxconn (2317.TW) said on Friday production at its largest iPhone factory remains normal, despite tightening COVID-19 restrictions at the plant in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou this week.

The Zhengzhou campus, which assembles Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhone and has about 300,000 workers, banned all dining in and required workers to take their meals back to their dormitories beginning on Wednesday, a notice posted on the factory's official WeChat account showed.

""Zhengzhou (plant) still maintains normal production and has little impact (from the situation),"" Foxconn told Reuters.

The new measures follow Zhengzhou's latest outbreak recording a total of 196 cases since Oct. 8, and come as Foxconn's factory is ramping up production of the latest iPhone 14 models.

497,743,APPLE,2022-10-24,Morning Bid: Tech tonic,"













Oct 25 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever

Bad (economic) news is good news, and good (earnings) news is also good news.

That's the general outlook on Wall Street right now as investors continue to claw back some of this year's losses - U.S. stocks on Monday shrugged off steep declines in Asia, especially China, to extend the bear market rally of the last two weeks.

The S&P 500 has rebounded some 9% from its Oct. 13 low, laughing in the face of rising bond yields and interest rate expectations. Monday's gains came despite recession-territory U.S. PMIs and a spike in the VIX volatility index back above 30.

Investors have plenty of other reasons to be cautious too: liquidity and financial stability concerns; political, economic and market trends in China; Japan's policy conundrum and FX market interventions; British political and market turbulence.

The news flow from Asia, in particular, is not conducive to a 'risk-on' trading environment. MSCI Asia ex-Japan and China's benchmark indexes fell to post-2020 lows on Monday, and the offshore yuan slumped to its lowest level since it was introduced in 2010.

You wouldn't bet against Asian and U.S. stock markets continuing to diverge.

One relative bright spot, however, could be U.S. earnings. So far, almost one-fifth of S&P 500 companies have reported. Of those, 75% have beat expectations, according to Refinitiv data.

The Q3 reporting season goes into overdrive this week with results from tech giants and tech-heavy firms including Twitter, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Meta Platforms and Amazon.com all on the docket.

If the Wall Street rebound is to continue and ripple to Asia, these results in particular could be crucial.

498,87,APPLE,2022-10-25,"Apple says issues with iMessage, FaceTime resolved","













Oct 25 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O)said on Tuesday issues that had caused a brief outage in its iMessage service and video calling app FaceTime were resolved.

Users had earlier complained of not being able to send and receive text messages on iMessage and some reported problems with placing FaceTime calls.

More than 2,000 users reported issues with sending messages on the app, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.

Downdetector tracks outages by collating status reports from several sources including user-submitted errors on its platform. The outage may be affecting a larger number of users.

Earlier on Tuesday, Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) WhatsApp faced a global outage, which was later resolved.

#imessagedown was trending on Twitter with over 30,000 tweets and several users posting memes about the outage.

499,266,APPLE,2022-10-25,Apple is cutting back production of iPhone 14 Plus due to weak demand - TrendForce,"













Oct 25 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is cutting back production of iPhone 14 Plus and is increasing the output of the more expensive iPhone 14 Pro due to lukewarm demand for the mid-range model, market research firm TrendForce said Tuesday.

The share of more expensive iPhone 14 Pro series has increased to 60% of the total output from the initially planned 50%, and it could rise to 65% in the future, the report said.

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.

Apple's focus on high-end models may help it counter the softness in smartphone sales. In the thick of the chip crisis, Apple's Pro and Pro Max premium tier of devices, which have been strong sellers, helped the company push margins higher.

The TrendForce report said that rising U.S. interest rates could crimp consumer spending, undermining the demand for iPhones in the first quarter of 2023. This could lead to a 14% year-on-year drop in production to 52 million units.

Analysts have in the past said iPhone 14's Pro and Pro Max versions were selling at a brisk pace, although demand for the base model, typically Apple's best seller, has been underwhelming. read more

Apple was the only vendor in the top five to register a growth in shipments in the third quarter, improving its share of the global smartphone market to 18% from 15% a year ago, according to research firm Canalys. The increase in share came as the overall smartphone market shrank 9%, Canalys said.

Last month, the company said it would manufacture its latest iPhone 14 in India, as the tech giant moves some of its production away from China to hedge risks arising from the growing tensions between Washington and Beijing.

TrendForce estimates the share of Apple's output from India to exceed 5% in 2023 and increase over the years.

500,80,APPLE,2022-10-25,"Apple announces new clean energy investments, asks suppliers to decarbonize","













Oct 25 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) said on Tuesday it would make fresh investments to set up solar and wind projects in Europe and called on its suppliers to decarbonize operations related to the production of iPhones and other products.

The company in 2020 had pledged to remove carbon emissions from its entire business, including products and its sprawling supply chain - which spans from Vietnam to Brazil - by 2030.

The iPhone maker will now require its supply partners to report on progress on carbon neutrality goals, specifically Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions reductions, related to the production of Apple products and will audit their progress annually.

More than 200 suppliers, representing 70% of Apple's direct manufacturing spending and including Corning Inc (GLW.N), Nitto Denko Corp (6988.T), SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS), STMicroelectronics (STM.BN), TSMC (2330.TW) and Yuto, have committed to using clean power such as wind or solar for all Apple production, Apple said.

Apple had previously asked suppliers to commit to 100% renewable energy for Apple's production.

""We're determined to be a ripple in the pond that creates a bigger change,"" Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said. Apple has been carbon neutral for its global corporate operations since 2020.

Many multinational companies are increasingly looking into global supply chains to reduce their carbon footprint as climate change becomes a bigger focus for investors and regulators.

Apple said the European investments are part of a strategy to address about 22% of its carbon footprint coming from the electricity customers use to charge their devices.

With the construction of new projects in Europe, the company is aiming to power all Apple devices on the continent with low-carbon electricity, it said.

In total, the planned investments will add 3,000 gigawatt hours per year of new renewable energy on the grid, Apple said.

Oct 26 (Reuters) - Gloomy results from Alphabet and Microsoft stoked fears of a global economic downturn and derailed an earnings-led surge in stock markets on Wednesday, while setting the tone for results from other megacap technology giants.

The Nasdaq (.IXIC) tumbled nearly 2% as the results underscored the fallout of strong dollar and weak demand on the tech sector against the backdrop of high inflation and rising borrowing costs.

Shares of the Google-parent (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) fell about 8% in early trading. Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), which will report after markets close, was down 4%, while Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) lost 4% and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) 1% in the run-up to their results on Thursday.

Heavyweights Netflix (NFLX.O), Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Apple have already lost a combined market value of more than $2.5 trillion so far this year and were set to shed another $330 billion on Wednesday.

""The results of the big technology firms were seen as a key determining factor in market sentiment going into the U.S. third quarter reporting season and both Microsoft and Alphabet have given investors reason to worry,"" said Laith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at AJ Bell.

Alphabet missed Wall Street's target for revenue growth in the third quarter as ad sales remained weak, while inflation and a strong dollar led Microsoft to report its slowest topline growth in five years. read more

At least 21 analysts cut their price target on Alphabet, lowering it by as much as $36, while 17 of them brought down their targets on Microsoft.

With analysts predicting a pullback in budgets for advertising due to rising prices, investors fear that Meta's business too could come under pressure as it revenue relies heavily on ads.

""Investors will be bracing for Meta's results with some trepidation, with a common thought being that if Google's struggling, the rest of the tech pack faces a marathon climb,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

For Meta, Google Search's soft results are worrisome while YouTube and Snap weakness suggest that macro and ad targeting challenges continued in the third quarter, JMP Securities analyst Andrew Boone wrote.

Meanwhile, a slowdown in growth at Azure, Microsoft's cloud platform and one of its most successful businesses, raised worries around Amazon's cloud business.

While most Big Tech stocks have edged higher in the past few weeks, overall it has been a bleak year for the sector that has lost roughly 15% to 60% of their value.

Wednesday's selloff also hit Europe's tech index (.SX8P), falling 2.3% to lead sectoral losses in the region. read more

502,744,APPLE,2022-10-26,Morning Bid: Policy peak?,"













Oct 27 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever

First Australia, now Canada. Who'll be next to blink on interest rates?

The Bank of Canada on Wednesday raised rates by 50 basis points, less than the 75 bps markets had expected. This surprise mirrored the Reserve Bank of Australia's half point hike three weeks ago, when investors had again positioned for an additional 25 bps of tightening.

""We are getting closer to the end of this tightening phase,"" BOC chief Tiff Macklem said, citing recession fears.

That's two of the world's major central banks now signaling that the peak in rates is in sight, while Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said last week that the market's rate path was too aggressive.

The European Central Bank and Bank of Japan are up next with policy decisions in the next 48 hours. Although they are at very different stages of the cycle - the BOJ hasn't even started tightening yet - dovish surprises could add fuel to the 'risk on' rally currently underway.

chart

Ok, Wall Street struggled on Wednesday in part due to earnings misses from Microsoft and Alphabet, but the S&P 500 hit a six-week high intraday and is up 7% this month. The VIX volatility index hit a six-week low, while bond yields fell sharply for a second day.

The dollar is also falling, another development that should in theory ease financial conditions and support risk assets. It is down 2% this week, on track for its biggest weekly fall since the COVID-19 pandemic's darkest days in March 2020.

Only time will tell how much of all this is simply a snap back in extreme positioning. But if the remaining heavyweight U.S. earnings this week beat forecasts and the ECB and BOJ play ball, it could have further to run.

Three key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Thursday:

503,388,APPLE,2022-10-26,"Apple's holiday quarter may face pressure from inflation, weak China demand","













Oct 24 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) earnings report on Thursday may show the best quarterly sales growth for iPhones this year but it could still foreshadow a difficult holiday period as China demand slows and inflation hits multi-decade highs.

Analysts expect iPhone sales to rise 11% in the fiscal fourth quarter ended September, according to Refinitiv, thanks to consumers upgrading to the company's premium-priced Pro phones. However, growth is estimated to slow to just 2% in the crucial holiday quarter.

The early days of the iPhone 14 product cycle have indicated lackluster demand for base models and strong appetite for the high-end variants, Synovus Trust's Dan Morgan said.

Morgan added that he expected ""the weaker consumer spending environment to impact the earnings trajectory"".

The latest earnings season has shown that even global tech giants, including Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), are not immune to macroeconomic pressures as a strong dollar becomes a drag on their growth and businesses pull back on spending . read more

Analysts believe Apple's move to leave prices unchanged on its latest Pro models is driving strong demand. The models are also aimed at affluent shoppers who are less vulnerable to inflation.

""The iPhone 14 Pro series boasts improved specifications yet unit prices are the same as last year's models, making pre-orders for the Pro series highly popular,"" market research firm TrendForce said.

CONTEXT

Analysts are expecting Apple to provide ""guidelines"" or an indication of how iPhone 14 is selling rather than a financial forecast.

The holiday quarter is typically Apple's biggest and accounts for about 30% of its annual revenue, since it launches iPhones and Macbooks ahead of the shopping season.

Macbook sales are expected to fall 5% in the holiday quarter, after a likely rise of about 2% in the September-ended quarter.

""We worry that Apple may have been a COVID beneficiary, amid work/learn from home and strong consumer spending, which could reverse, particularly as consumers' spending priorities change and rising rates potentially pressure demand,"" Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said.

Focus will be on Apple's services business, where revenue is set to rise 10% in the fourth quarter, as the company looks to dial up its streaming service. While Apple TV has generated critically acclaimed hits, it lacks the viewership of rival platforms such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O).

FUNDAMENTALS

* Q4 revenue is expected to grow 6.7% to $88.9 billion; Q1 revenue expected to grow 3.6% to $128.38 billion, the slowest growth rate for the holiday quarter since the pandemic

* Analysts predict Q4 profit of $1.27 per share

WALL STREET SENTIMENT

* Of 43 analysts covering the stock, 37 rate it ""buy"" or higher, 5 ""hold"" and 1 ""sell""

* The stock is down about 16% this year but has still outperformed others in the trillion-dollar club as well as those in FAANG.

505,892,APPLE,2022-10-27,"Investors brush off STMicro CEO's growth assurances, shares dive","Summary

Summary Companies Q3 sales, gross margin beat expectations

Expects sales to grow 1.8% in Q4 from Q3

CEO confident to be on 'trajectory of growth' in 2023

Shares fall by close to 8%















PARIS, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Investors brushed off upbeat comments by STMicroelectronics' boss on Thursday after the Franco-Italian chipmaker pointed to a slower pace of growth at year end, as falling demand for electronic products adds to fears of a global recession.

Shares of the Geneva-based company, whose biggest clients include iPhone maker Apple (AAPL.O) and carmaker Tesla (TSLA.O), were diving by close to 8% at 0907 GMT, making the stock the worst performer of France's blue-chip index CAC 40 (.FCHI).

""Results are good but the outlook is disappointing,"" a Milan-based trader said, noting general caution about the sector's outlook.

Headwinds are building for the semiconductor industry, with rising Taiwan-China and U.S.-China tensions and red-hot inflation that could squeeze spending on cars, smartphones and other consumer products.

In a call with analysts, STMicro's boss said twice that the company had high visibility on the group's orders for the next six to eight quarters, with its manufacturing plants running at full capacity.

""This makes us very confident to drive the company on a trajectory of growth in 2023,"" Jean-Marc Chery said, confirming the group's target of $20 billion in yearly sales by 2027 at the latest.

Bigger rival Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O) said this week it expected demand across most of its end markets to decline, while South Korea's SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS) warned of an ""unprecedented deterioration"" in memory chip demand.

STMicro said earlier it expected fourth-quarter sales to edge up by 1.8% from the previous quarter to about $4.4 billion. That contrasts with a jump of 12.6% in the three months that ended on Sept. 30.

Co-controlled by the Italian and French governments, STMicro said demand rose across all its products in the third quarter, beating market expectations, with total net revenue reaching 4.32 billion.

Gross margin stood at 47.6% in the third quarter, also above analysts' average predictions.

STMicro said it now expected full-year net revenue of $16.1 billion, up 26% on the year, as well as a gross margin of about 47.3%, in line with previous guidance.

AMSTERDAM, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Universal Music Group NV (UMG) (UMG.AS), the largest record label, on Thursday reported better than expected third-quarter core earnings due to a legal settlement, though streaming revenue growth slowed.

The company said top sellers in the quarter included Korean pop band BTS, BLACKPINK, Ado, INI and Morgan Wallen.

Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were 539 million euros ($538 million), compared with 426 million euros in the third quarter of 2021.

Analysts had forecast EBITDA at 524 million euros, according to Refinitiv data.

Revenue rose 13.3% to 2.66 billion euros, with streaming and subscription revenue up 7.7%. The revenue figure included a 71 million euro benefit due to the settlement of a copyright infringement lawsuit, which also influenced EBITDA.

""Although still healthy, the slower revenue growth relative to the first half of this year was largely timing-related,"" Chief Financial Officer Boyd Muir said on a post-earnings call.

He noted the third quarter of 2021 had ""included new releases from Billy Eilish and from Drake, as well as a significant Olivia Rodrigo carryover.""

Ad-supported streaming revenues had slowed ""consistent with worldwide advertising trends, which continue to impact this part of our business, ""he said.

UMG, which competes against Warner Music Group (WMG.O) and Sony , was spun out of France's Vivendi (VIV.PA) in 2021.

Shares closed down about 1% at 20.78 euros in Amsterdam, after surging more than 10% earlier this week on news Apple had raised prices for its Apple Music streaming service.

Universal, whose artists include Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber, receives a cut of royalties when their music is streamed on Apple Music or other streaming platforms like Spotify.

Preliminary Q3 GDP seen at +3.2% y/y (prior qtr +3.05%)

Data due Friday, Oct 28, after 4 p.m. (0800 GMT)















TAIPEI, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Taiwan's economy likely expanded slightly faster in the third quarter compared to the prior quarter but at an anaemic pace due to increased global economic headwinds denting demand for technology which is a key export, a Reuters poll showed.

Gross domestic product (GDP) likely grew 3.2% in July-September versus a year earlier, the poll of 20 economists shows, after it expanded 3.05% year-on-year in the second quarter. read more

Policymakers have said they expect full-year 2022 growth of less than 4%, downgrading it from previous forecasts of more than 4% and slower than the 6.45% logged for 2021. That was the fastest rate in over a decade since it expanded 10.25% in 2010.

Economists' forecasts for preliminary GDP data due on Friday varied widely from growth of 1.8% to as high as 4.4%.

Demand for Taiwanese goods has been hit by COVID-19 lockdowns in China, as well as soaring global inflation and tightening monetary policy.

Woods Chen, head of macroeconomics at Yuanta Securities Investment Consulting in Taipei, said domestic demand was ""not bad"" due to Taiwan gradually undoing COVID-19 controls, but the problem was with exports.

""Our estimate is quite low, and of course that's because of negative growth in exports,"" he said, pointing to September's exports which fell an on-year 5.3%, the first contraction in more than two years. read more

As a key hub in the global technology supply chain for giants such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Taiwan's economy had been outperforming many of its regional peers.

A global shortage of semiconductors has swelled order books for Taiwanese chipmakers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) (2330.TW), .

TSMC reported an 80% surge in third-quarter profit, the strongest growth in two years. read more

The economy in China, Taiwan's largest trading partner, expanded 3.9% in the third quarter year-on-year, faster than expected and quickening from the 0.4% pace in the second quarter. read more

Oct 27 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) shares skidded as much as 21% after hours on Thursday after it forecast costs might eviscerate its profit for the current quarter, as early holiday marketing does little to boost sales growth and as labor and delivery expenses continue to swell.

The news followed similarly huge slide in META Platform shares (META.O) on Thursday, after the Facebook parent reported late Wednesday costly metaverse bets and the impact of soaring inflation on ad spending, which spooked investors. But Apple earnings on Thursday were a bright spot, with higher than expected revenue leaving its shares (AAPL.O) only slightly lower. read more

Amazon's net sales were $127.1 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, lower than analysts' expectations of $127.46 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

COMMENTS:

DANIEL MORGAN, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SYNOVUS TRUST, ATLANTA, GEORGIA

""The Amazon and Apple reports showed divergence in terms of the overall health of the consumer. Amazon is down because of their fourth quarter revenue outlook. But then we look at the Apple report and they reported strong growth in a lot of their consumer categories. Their iPhones, Macs, wearables, and services all had positive growth rates. So it seems to me that Apple is in a better position in regards to weathering this slowdown in consumer spending.""

""Amazon came out and reported that they expect fourth quarter revenues to be below expectations and only grow 2% to 8% in this upcoming Christmas season. Going into the holiday season you would expect the consumer to really ramp up so that I see a big divergence between Apple and Amazon.""

""That is a huge black cloud on Amazon stock, which gives you the impression they're not as well positioned.""

""Apple is a different model than Amazon. It creates its own products and has a very loyal user base. Amazon is just a conduit for other merchants.""

""Intel was all just cost cutting. Their client computing, PC unit was better than expected. That was good.""

""They came in and announced this massive cost cutting, from which you can create growth. They're embracing the moment, realizing that they're not executing and have to realign their business. The street is applauding this cost cutting agenda they've put together to try to grow earnings again.""

DANIEL KRIETER, DIRECTOR, FI STRATEGY, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK

""The selloff in tech stocks post earnings indicates that the Fed’s restrictive policy is beginning to be felt in the real economy with growth slowing meaningfully. Now we wait to find out if the Fed can achieve a soft landing…it will be very difficult.""

ANDREW LIPSMAN, PRINCIPAL ANALYST, INSIDER INTELLIGENCE

""It looks like AWS is the primary culprit for the underperformance this quarter, as a relatively sharp slowdown in growth was directly responsible for the topline miss and weighed heavily on profits as well. The AWS slowdown is a clear sign that businesses are beginning to trim costs, so this will likely put more of a squeeze on Amazon's bottom line in the coming quarters.

""The commerce and ads businesses did pretty well at a time when Amazon needed to show some renewed momentum, so it was successful in reversing those trends. Amazon is well-positioned to continue that momentum in Q4 with the added boost from the October Prime Early Access Event, but will face mounting headwinds in the consumer economy amid high inflation and rising interest rates.""

MICHAEL O’ROURKE, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, JONESTRADING, STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT

""A lot of people have been holding out that earnings would hold up here. The guidance that Amazon gave is pretty disappointing, in the sense the fourth quarter is their Christmas quarter. They talked about struggling back in July when they reported Q2, and yet the stock rallied 30, 40%. So obviously there are still problems there.""

""As far as Apple, the numbers weren't great; they weren't terrible. But I think everyone wants to hear what the guidance is for next quarter.""

From a markets perspective, you have to be cautious going forward. When you think about whether it's the FANGs or Tesla... they're the biggest stocks in the market, and we really haven't had much of anything good come out of any of them. A lot of what is holding the broad tape up at the moment is hopes of central bank policy pivots.""

""Obviously these companies are showing that the interest rate hikes and policy tightening are having an effect. We just don't know how much of an effect, but it's notable. And I think you're going to see through year end investors trying to take a step back. They need a new baseline of where the trend of business is going forward, so I would expect more volatility going into year end.""

RICK MECKLER, PARTNER, CHERRY LANE INVESTMENTS, A FAMILY INVESTMENT OFFICE, NEW VERNON, NEW JERSEY “Big tech companies are not impervious to slowdowns in the economy, particularly if they are consumer driven. What we saw in the past is that in a period of growth, tech really grew faster than anything else and got multiples that reflected that. But as the Fed embarks on this planned slowdown, it is eating away at some of their consumer-faced businesses and given their high multiples it is causing big contractions in their stock prices.”

QUINCY KROSBY, CHIEF GLOBAL STRATEGIST, LPL FINANCIAL, CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA

""We were so used to tech outperforming during the pandemic. There was always concern going into earnings, and quarter after quarter, they surprised to the upside. This period has been a major switch for tech. The higher rates don't help, and you have the stronger dollar as a headwind amid the backdrop of weaker demand. So this is a period that is difficult.""

KIM FORREST, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BOKEH CAPITAL PARTNERS, PITTSBURGH

""The world has changed but people haven't. They want what won last year to win this year.""

""Amazon results just reflect the changing tastes of the consumer which nobody should be surprised by it. We were locked in our homes for two years and we're getting out.""

""The companies and investors thought this would go on forever so the big technology companies like Amazon continued hiring to support a business that looks like the year 2021, and it’s not 2021. It’s 2022. Layer on top of this inflation. People are buying less stuff, I would have to guess. We know they're buying less stuff from Amazon.""

""The big part with Apple is what they think looking forward. Despite the headwinds of the strong dollar and their consumers having to battle inflation, the results are pretty good.""

""Intel results surprised on the upside. They'd been priced for a going out of business sale which they are not. It's still a long road ahead but this quarter was a bright spot. But we still have commentary on the call so don't get too excited.""

509,32,APPLE,2022-10-27,Apple earnings rise as economic gloom hits tech,"













Oct 27 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Thursday reported revenue and profit that topped Wall Street targets, one of the few bright spots in a tech sector battered by spending cutbacks due to inflation.

The forecast for the holiday quarter was more grim. While not providing specific numbers, Apple said revenue growth would fall below 8% in the December quarter but did not go as far as Amazon.com AMZN.O, whose dire holiday outlook sent its shares down 14%.

Apple shares initially dipped in after-hours trading but recovered in positive territory.

The Cupertino, California-based tech giant was saved by its oldest technology, its laptop computers, while its star, the iPhone, stumbled.

Although iPhone sales were not as strong as some analysts had targeted, they were still a record for the September quarter. Mac sales of $11.5 billion were far head of analyst estimates of $9.36 billion.

Apple's results showed some resilience in the face of a weak economy and strong U.S. dollar that has led to disastrous reports from many tech companies. Like Facebook parent Meta (META.O) and Snap (SNAP.N), Apple is seeing softness in advertising spending. Overall, Apple said quarterly revenue rose 8% to $90.1 billion, above estimates of $88.9 billion, and net profit was $1.29 per share, topping with the average analyst estimate of $1.27 per share, according to Refinitiv data.

""We did better than we anticipated, in spite of the fact that foreign exchange was a significant negative for us,"" said Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri.

The rising U.S. dollar has hit many companies such as Apple that generate substantial foreign revenue and are getting less cash back when they convert it. For consumers, it increases the price of new devices when bought in countries outside of the United States.

Apple's iPhone sales for the company's fiscal fourth quarter rose to $42.6 billion, when Wall Street expected sales of $43.21 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES.

Maestri said iPhone sales set a record for the September quarter, improving 10% over the prior year's quarter and exceeding the company's forecast.

""The iPhone number is a hint of the turmoil and uncertainty in the market, but Apple has different ways to offset,"" said Runar Bjorhovde, a research analyst at market research firm Canalys.

Sales of Apple's Mac computers received a boost from this summer's introduction of redesigned MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptops. New tablets went on sale this week.

Apple said its gross margin of 43.3% was a record for the September quarter.

Maestri said the robust computer sales also reflected a backlog of orders, caused by a prolonged shutdown at one of the factories that produces Macs, which the Apple was able to fill in the quarter.

The company reported sales of iPads were $7.2 billion, compared with the average estimate of $7.94 billion.

Apple wearables such as AirPods and other accessories notched sales of $9.7 billion, slightly ahead of the Wall Street forecast of $9.2 billion.

""They said they didn’t have particular issue with supply, so that seems to be a thing of the past,"" said Creative Strategies consumer analyst Carolina Milanesi.

Growth in the company's services business, which has buoyed sales and profits in recent years, saw a rise to $19.2 billion in revenue, below the estimate of $20.10 billion.

Maestri said Apple experienced softness in digital advertising and gaming, as have others in the sector.

""Like other major tech companies, even Apple is suffering from the negative impact of a worsening macro backdrop and ongoing supply chain woes, though it has done a better job of navigating through the challenging environment,"" Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.

In China, which has experienced a sharp economic slowdown, Apple reported fourth-quarter sales of $15.5 billion. That is a gain from the prior quarter, when Apple logged sales of $14.6 billion.

Apple said it now has 900 million paying subscribers to its services, up from the previous quarter's 860 million.

510,463,APPLE,2022-10-27,Morning Bid: The yen also rises,"













Oct 28 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever

The heat is off the Bank of Japan. A little.

The BOJ announces its policy decision on Friday against a much calmer market backdrop than only a few days ago. Economists expect no change to the bank's ultra-loose stance and an upward revision to the inflation outlook.

Other Japanese data due on Friday include inflation and unemployment, which could also drive trading sentiment in Asia.

The dollar has slumped to a three-week low against the yen and below the level that prompted the BOJ's historic yen-buying intervention on Sept. 22. Two subsequent bouts of suspected intervention appear to have done the trick, for now at least.

chart

chart

Not only has the BOJ been helped by a wider pullback in the dollar, as investors begin to consider a less aggressive Fed beyond next week's expected 75 bps rate hike, an easing of financial conditions has helped markets more broadly.

The Dow is up five days in a row, its best run since August, the 10-year Treasury yield is back below 4% and MSCI Asia ex-Japan is up three days in a row, its best stretch in seven weeks.

Of course, it's a bit more complicated than that. Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) shares sank 25% after its Q3 results spooked investors, hammering the tech sector. Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) are up next with earnings.

There are other reasons to suspect this week's 'risk on' rally could soon fade.

While it may not be directly affecting markets on a day-to-day basis, there is still a war raging on Europe's doorstep. And after Chinese President Xi Jinping secured his third term as leader at the weekend, cities and districts across China are doubling down on COVID-19 lockdowns.

Three key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Friday:

511,684,APPLE,2022-10-27,"Morning Bid: Meta averse, ECB decides and CS slides","













A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.

Meta added a deep pothole to an already bumpy U.S. earnings season - another obstacle to a market pumped-up by bets of some central bank relief on the horizon as G7 economies slow.

The Facebook parent's shares (META.O) plunged almost 20% after the bell on Wednesday after the firm forecast a weak holiday quarter and higher costs next year, while investors grew skeptical of its pricey metaverse bets. read more

With Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon reporting later on Thursday, sentiment toward tech giants remains on edge. Beyond the interest rate cheer at the banks and energy crunch windfalls for Big Oil, other real sector readouts weren't much better than the tech world and Boeing (BA.N) stock fell almost 10% on Wednesday after its profit miss too. read more

But the big digital damage has cut across this month's powerful market rally, an updraft based largely on the slightly vague hopes that the U.S. Federal Reserve may next week signal yet another jumbo 75 basis point interest rate rise could be the last of such magnitude in this cycle.

The Bank of Canada certainly added fuel to that fire on Wednesday with a smaller-than-expected half-point rate hike and said it was getting closer to the end of its historic tightening campaign as the economy is set to stall next year.

The European Central Bank is the latest of the G7 to decide on policy on Thursday, with markets assuming its lagged tightening cycle will - unlike the Canadians - see it deliver the expected 75 bps and detail some further adjustments and rowback to more extraordinary easing measures.

The euro stalled and euro government bond yields edged higher in advance.

The vigil partly also reversed this week's eye-catching recoil in U.S. Treasury yields (.MIWD00000PUS) and the U.S. dollar - both of which perked up ahead of the ECB decision and the release of third-quarter U.S. gross domestic product data. U.S. GDP is expected to show a hefty 2.4% growth rebound following first half contractions.

But after two-week, trough-to-peak bounce of almost 10%, global stock indices (.MIWD00000PUS) struggled to make much headway for the second session on Thursday. Asia bourses were mixed, Europe in the red and U.S. futures up marginally.

The mood wasn't helped much by Switzerland's ailing Credit Suisse (CSGN.S). CS shares plunged 15% after it revealed a long-awaited restructuring plan that raises 4 billion Swiss francs in stock sales, slashes thousands of jobs and spins off its investment bank to stanch a string of heavy losses.

Better news emerged in dealmaking, with Twitter shares (TWTR.N) up 1% after reports banks have started to send $13 billion in cash backing Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter in a sign that the deal is on track to close by the end of the week.

Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Thursday:

* European Central Bank policy decision and press briefing; Bank of Japan begins two day policy meeting

* U.S. Q3 GDP, Sept durable goods orders, Kansas City Fed Oct manufacturing index

* U.S. Treasury auctions 7-year notes

512,761,APPLE,2022-10-27,"T-Mobile's cheaper plans, 5G edge help lift 2022 subscriber forecast again","













Oct 27 (Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) on Thursday raised its annual forecast for monthly bill-paying wireless subscriber additions for a third time, as more Americans pick its superior 5G services and cheaper plans compared to rivals AT&T (T.N) and Verizon (VZ.N).

Shares in T-Mobile rose 3% in extended trading after the company also beat third-quarter estimates for wireless phone customer additions, helped by discounts on smartphones and plans at industry-low prices.

It also has an edge in the 5G game, owing to the chunky 2.5Ghz mid-band spectrum it won through its $23 billion buyout of rival Sprint in 2020, while Verizon and AT&T are building up the mid-band that provides a good balance of capacity and coverage.

So, while other telcos bear huge costs on 5G deployments, T-Mobile's roll-out has been less expensive and helpful in managing costs, CFRA analyst Keith Snyder said.

T-Mobile executives told Reuters a rebound in international travel, strong demand for its priciest $85 Magenta Max plan that is bundled with streaming services such as Apple TV+, pushed up subscriber additions and helped raise forecast across wireless additions, core adjusted earnings and free cash flow.

""T-Mobile has done a very good job of making the pricier plans more valuable to justify the cost,"" said Anshel Sag, analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.

The company added 854,000 monthly bill-paying phone subscribers in the third quarter, above FactSet estimates of 724,800, and 578,000 high-speed internet customers.

In comparison, AT&T added 708,000 postpaid phone subscribers and Verizon, the largest U.S. carrier by subscribers, added only 8,000 customers in the same period.

T-Mobile expects to add between 6.2 million and 6.4 million net monthly-bill paying subscribers in 2022, up from a prior forecast of 6 million to 6.3 million.

513,426,APPLE,2022-10-27,"EU wants 40-man antitrust team to enforce new tech rules, official says","













BRUSSELS, Oct 27 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are looking to establish a 40-man team and hire a technology expert to enforce tough new rules aimed at reining in the powers of Big Tech, an EU official said on Thursday.

The rules known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA) sets out a list of do's and don'ts for Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Meta (META.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and other gatekeepers which control access to their sites and the data there.

Reuters exclusively reported in July that the European Commission was considering creating a new directorate to allay concerns that it may struggle to get deep-pocketed and well-advised tech companies to comply with the new rules.

A 12-man unit headed by antitrust veteran Thomas Kramler who is currently handling the Apple and Amazon antitrust investigations and a 9-person strong taskforce will move to the new directorate, the official said.

The EU competition enforcer aims to hire 19 more people for the directorate and a chief technology officer to focus on data, the official said.

The new unit will need the green light from the college of commissioners from the 27 EU countries in the coming weeks before it can be set up.

Enforcement of the DMA will be done jointly with the Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology which has also set up a new unit for the task.

The Commission has previously said some 80 enforcers would be needed.

Summary Law firms

Law firms Related documents Apple and Optus still awaiting court ruling on fair terms of use More rulings to come in long-running U.K. litigation















(Reuters) - Apple Inc lost an appeal in a London court on Thursday in the latest stage of a long-running dispute over key telecommunications patents used in Apple devices including iPhones and iPads.

The Court of Appeal ruled Texas-based Optis Cellular Technology LLC can stop Apple infringing its patents which are essential to certain technological standards, such as 4G, before a court has ruled on fair terms of use.

Judge Richard Arnold said on Thursday that in order to avoid an injunction on utilising the patents in England and Wales Apple only needed to agree to take a global licence over the standard essential patents on terms which a court found are fair and reasonable.

He ruled that a lower court’s finding that Apple intended to use one of Optis’ patents without a licence before the terms were decided by the High Court in London was “obviously correct”.

The decision by the Court of Appeal, which upholds the lower court’s ruling, marks the latest chapter in litigation initially brought by Optis in 2019 that has since prompted six separate trials and three appellate hearings in Britain alone, with two further Court of Appeal hearings due next year.

The sixth trial, concerning the fair terms of a licence to use Optis’ patents – which will apply globally – and Apple’s claims that Optis has abused its dominant position, was heard in June and July and a judgment is pending.

Apple and Optis are also engaged in parallel litigation in the United States, where an East Texas court in May rejected Apple’s bid for a third trial after it was hit with a $300 million verdict for violating Optis’ wireless-standard U.S. patent rights.

Judge Arnold was also critical of Apple and Optis over their conduct of the litigation, saying Apple’s appeal and Optis’ cross-appeal illustrated “the dysfunctional state of the current system.”

He said both parties “adopted its position in an attempt to game the system in its favour” and called on organisations which set technological standards to require “legally-enforceable arbitration” of patent disputes as part of their intellectual property rights policies in order to “put a stop to such behaviour”.

Apple and Optis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The case is Optis Celluar Technology LLC and others v Apple Retail UK Limited and others, CA-2021-003153.

515,435,APPLE,2022-10-27,"China smartphone shipments slid 11% in Q3, research firm says","













SHANGHAI, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Smartphone shipments in China fell 11% year-on-year in the third quarter as the country's slowing economy took a toll on consumer demand, research firm Canalys reported on Thursday.

Brands shipped a total of 70 million smartphones to sellers in the period, down from 78.9 million in same period last year.

While Apple Inc (AAPL.O) was the only brand to buck the trend, with shipments jumping 36% to 11.3 million, analysts say that the surge was due to demand for the iPhone 14 Pro model, and demand for the basic iPhone 14 model has been weak.

The dip continues an ongoing trend for the sector, which in recent years has faced challenges ranging from the global chip shortage, the economic impact of China's zero-COVID policy, and lengthening upgrade cycles from consumers.

""Vendors have been suffering from rapidly declining demand and high inventory over past quarters which has severely damaged confidence in the overall supply chain,"" Canalys analyst Toby Zhu wrote in the report.

Vivo, owned by the Shenzhen-based conglomerate BBK, was the top-ranked brand in the quarter, shipping 14.1 million devices and taking a market share of 20%. The top three brands - vivo, OPPO, and Honor - saw shipments fall 23%, 27%, and 16% respectively.

Apple currently ranks as the fourth top-selling brand in China, with a market share of 13%.

The company ""is not currently isolated from weak mainland China consumer demand,"" wrote Canalys analyst Amber Liu, adding that the company has been launching aggressive promotions on previous-generation devices in order to fend off competition from rivals.

Xiaomi Corp (1810.HK), which ranked as the fifth top-selling brand, saw shipments fall 17%.

516,768,APPLE,2022-10-27,Pinterest soars as revenue beat stands out in social media gloom,"













Oct 27 (Reuters) - Pinterest Inc (PINS.N) beat estimates for quarterly revenue on Thursday, making it a rare bright spot in an otherwise downbeat social media sector and sending the image-sharing platform's shares 15% higher in after-hours trading.

A decline in advertising budgets because of decades-high inflation has roiled earnings of online players from Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) to Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and Snap Inc . read more

But Pinterest's results show its ads business stayed resilient amid the wider industry downturn and people were still engaging with its image-sharing platform for inspiration to take up activities such as home renovation and recipe-based cooking.

Pinterest returned to user growth in the July-September period after three straight quarters of decline, with its global monthly active users rising 2.8% sequentially to 445 million, above Factset estimates of 437.4 million.

Part of the growth was fueled by an update to Apple Inc's iOS 16 in September, finance chief Todd Morgenfeld said on a call with analysts.

He added the resilience in ad sales was driven by the fact that a large portion of Pinterest's ad sales come from e-commerce and consumer goods.

""What hurt Pinterest before (during the pandemic) is helping them now,"" said D.A. Davidson analyst Thomas Forte, referring to the company's focus on retail and consumer goods.

""The bigger opportunity going forward is to find a way to drive incremental engagement on the platform and get monthly active users growing again and improve monetization since growth is slowing.""

Pinterest's third-quarter revenue rose 8% to $684.6 million. While the pace of growth was its slowest in nearly two years, the figure came in well above analysts' average estimate of $666.7 million, according to Refinitiv.

The company's global average revenue per user jumped 11% to $1.56. It earned an adjusted profit of $0.11 per share, above analyst estimates of $0.06 per share.

BRUSSELS, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google's Google Play Store is the target of an EU antitrust investigation, the company said in a regulatory filing, a move that could expose the U.S. tech giant to another billion-euro fine.

Over the last decade, Google has incurred 8.25 billion euros ($8.24 billion) in EU antitrust fines following three investigations into its business practices.

""In May 2022, the EC (European Commission) and the CMA (Britain's Competition and Markets Authority) each opened a formal investigation into Google Play's business practices,"" Google said in a quarterly earnings filing dated Oct. 25.

The European Union antitrust watchdog declined to comment.

EU antitrust regulators are investigating whether Google's threat to remove apps from its Play Store if app developers use other payment options instead of its own billing system has hurt the developers, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters in August.

Fees charged by Google and Apple (AAPL.O) at their mobile app stores have drawn criticism from developers who say they are excessive.

Separately, Google said on Thursday it will appeal its record 4.1-billion-euro EU antitrust fine at Europe's top court after a lower tribunal threw out its challenge last month.

The Luxembourg-based General Court broadly backed the Commission's 2018 decision but pruned the fine to 4.125 billion euros from 4.34 billion euros.

Judges agreed with the European Union competition watchdog that Google had imposed unlawful restrictions on manufacturers of Android mobile devices and mobile network operators to consolidate the dominant position of its search engine.

""We are preparing our appeal. The deadline for the court is Dec. 1,"" a Google spokesperson said.

The company can only appeal on matters of law to the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union.

The bloc is boosting its antitrust power with new landmark tech rules curbing online gatekeepers, companies which control access to their platforms and data there, with which the companies will have to comply in the first quarter of 2024.

Preliminary Q3 GDP seen at +3.2% y/y (prior qtr +3.05%)

Data due Friday, Oct 28, after 4 p.m. (0800 GMT)















TAIPEI, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Taiwan's economy likely expanded slightly faster in the third quarter compared to the prior quarter but at an anaemic pace due to increased global economic headwinds denting demand for technology which is a key export, a Reuters poll showed.

Gross domestic product (GDP) likely grew 3.2% in July-September versus a year earlier, the poll of 20 economists shows, after it expanded 3.05% year-on-year in the second quarter. read more

Policymakers have said they expect full-year 2022 growth of less than 4%, downgrading it from previous forecasts of more than 4% and slower than the 6.45% logged for 2021. That was the fastest rate in over a decade since it expanded 10.25% in 2010.

Economists' forecasts for preliminary GDP data due on Friday varied widely from growth of 1.8% to as high as 4.4%.

Demand for Taiwanese goods has been hit by COVID-19 lockdowns in China, as well as soaring global inflation and tightening monetary policy.

Woods Chen, head of macroeconomics at Yuanta Securities Investment Consulting in Taipei, said domestic demand was ""not bad"" due to Taiwan gradually undoing COVID-19 controls, but the problem was with exports.

""Our estimate is quite low, and of course that's because of negative growth in exports,"" he said, pointing to September's exports which fell an on-year 5.3%, the first contraction in more than two years. read more

As a key hub in the global technology supply chain for giants such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Taiwan's economy had been outperforming many of its regional peers.

A global shortage of semiconductors has swelled order books for Taiwanese chipmakers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) (2330.TW), .

TSMC reported an 80% surge in third-quarter profit, the strongest growth in two years. read more

Summary Companies Oil firm smashes Wall Street forecasts with $19.7 billion profit

Exxon's fossil-fuel bets eclipse rivals Shell, TotalEnergies

Company projects flat oil output this year on Russia losses















HOUSTON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) on Friday smashed expectations as soaring energy prices fueled a record-breaking quarterly profit, nearly matching that of tech giant Apple.

Its $19.66 billion third-quarter net profit far exceeded recently raised Wall Street forecasts as skyrocketing natural gas and high oil prices put its earnings within reach of Apple's (AAPL.O) $20.7 billion net for the same period.

As recently as 2013, Exxon ranked as the largest publicly traded U.S. company by market value - a position now held by Apple. Exxon shares rose 3% to $110.70, a record high that gave it a market value of $461 billion.

Oil company profits have soared this year as rising demand and an undersupplied energy market collided with Western sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. U.S. exports of gas and oil to Europe have jumped and promise to set all-time profit records for the industry.

The top U.S. oil producer reported a per-share profit of $4.68, exceeding Wall Street's $3.89 consensus view, on a huge jump in natural gas earnings, continued high oil prices and strong fuel sales.

""Where others pulled back in the face of uncertainty and a historic slowdown, retreating and retrenching, this company moved forward, continuing to invest,"" Chief Executive Darren Woods told investors. Its quarterly profits ""reflect that deep commitment"" as well as higher prices, he added.

Exxon led record gains among oil majors in the second quarter and has leapfrogged Shell Plc (SHEL.L) and TotalEnergies SE (TTEF.PA) with earnings almost twice as big from continued bets on fossil fuels as competitors shifted investment to renewables.

Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics

Exxon banked $43 billion in the first nine months of this year, 19% more than in the same period of 2008, when oil prices traded at a record level of $140 per barrel.

Earnings from pumping oil and gas tripled last quarter while profit from selling motor fuels jumped tenfold compared with year-ago levels. Natural gas sales to Europe and soaring demand for diesel fuel led the company's better-than-expected results.

""The refining businesses - both in the U.S. and international - was the star performer,"" said Peter McNally, an analyst at Third Bridge.

Those rising fuel profits have renewed calls by U.S. President Joe Biden for companies to invest the windfall from this year's energy price run-up in production rather than buy back their own shares.

Exxon will maintain its $30 billion share buyback through 2023 while increasing dividends, Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells told Reuters. On Friday, it declared a fourth-quarter per-share dividend of 91 cents, up 3 cents, and will pay $15 billion to shareholders this year.

Exxon said its U.S. oil and gas production from the Permian Basin was near 560,000 barrels of oil and gas per day (boepd), a record. Production for the year will increase about 20% over 2021, said CEO Woods.

""We're optimizing and adjusting our development plans,"" he told analysts, with the full-year production gain below the 25% increase Exxon had forecast in February.

Results also were helped by an almost 100,000-boepd increase over the previous quarter in Guyana, where Exxon leads a consortium responsible for all output in the South American nation.

But its withdrawal from Russia reduced its overall production forecast for the year by about 100,000 barrels per day. Exxon said its Russian assets were expropriated.

""We are going to end up at about 3.7 million barrels a day for the full year,"" Mikells said, down from a 3.8 million bpd goal set in February.

Oct 28 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) shares fell about 8% on Friday after forecasting holiday-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates, while its Big Tech peers recovered from a bruising selloff this week.

The online retailer, whose market cap briefly fell below $1 trillion, was last down 8.4% at $101.66, after hitting its lowest since April 2020.

Apple Inc (AAPL.O), however, shone bright amid a crowd of dimming lights in the Big Tech space, as the iPhone maker reported revenue and profit that topped analysts' estimates.

Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta gained between 1.2% and 3.1% after their shares were battered this week following gloomy outlook from the companies.

The Big Tech stocks are on track to lose more than $400 billion this week.

Many view the megacap companies as bellwethers for how corporate America is faring during a year in which inflation has soared, pushing the U.S. Federal Reserve to enact a series of jumbo-sized rate hikes that have bruised markets.

Analysts fear macroeconomic factors, including a strong dollar, will continue to hit Amazon in the near term, however, over a longer period of time, the retailer should be able to bounce back.

""Despite accelerating revenues, Amazon has been cut down to size by the market after missing expectations. Efficiency has yet to return to the e-commerce business,"" Ben Barringer, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said.

While the cloud services segment has been one of high and sustained growth for tech companies, indications for Amazon, Microsoft and Intel Corp (INTC.O) this week point to lower investments as costs rise.

Intel's shares rose about 7% after the chipmaker said its cost-reduction plan includes layoffs and is expected to lower costs by $3 billion next year.

However, analysts are cautious of how the company plans to cut costs.

Cost reductions are necessary, but Intel needs to focus on cutting spending in the right places and keep research and development investments high, Glenn O'Donnell, research director at Forrester, said.

522,120,APPLE,2022-10-28,Exxon and Apple are in a similar boat,"













NEW YORK, Oct 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) might be able to give Apple (AAPL.O) a lesson in disruption. The oil company said Friday that it earned $20 billion in the third quarter, its best quarter ever, and nearly as much as Apple said it made earlier in the week. But the oil giant, which was the world’s most valuable firm about a decade ago, is only worth a fifth of the $2.5 trillion technology firm. The market’s newfound respect for earnings, and the recognition that ingrained beliefs can be fleeting, could partly close this gap.

Exxon’s profit was nearly triple last quarter what it was in the same quarter last year, and it wasn’t alone. Chevron’s profit, announced the same day, came close to doubling. The results are largely a function of higher commodity prices. Exxon said volume, or barrels of oil equivalent, only rose 1%, while Chevron (CVX.N) production was flat. Firms are also keeping investment under tight control. Oil investors have been clear that they want discipline, as demand will likely peak soon if it hasn’t already.

That means Exxon will presumably never reclaim its crown as the world’s most valuable firm, and Apple still earned far more than the company in the past year. Plus the $2.3 trillion technology giant’s earnings have grown far faster over the past 20 years. Investors assume, with good reason, that earnings growth at Tim Cook’s company will therefore continue to be faster.

Yet investor perceptions of future profit can be reassessed rapidly, as the massive falls in other tech companies like Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O) illustrated this week. They lost about $200 billion between them, as investors were disappointed with their growth, and the hefty investment they need to stay on top. It’s not unthinkable that, like with oil, new technologies will eventually upend Apple’s business. Staying profitable in the meantime is key.

Summary

Summary Companies https://tmsnrt.rs/3TSI7Tp















TAIPEI, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Production of Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhones could slump by as much as 30% at one of the world's biggest factories next month due to tightening COVID-19 curbs in China, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said on Monday.

Manufacturer Foxconn, formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (2317.TW), is working to boost production at another factory in Shenzhen city to make up for the shortfall, said the person, declining to be identified as the information was private.

Its main Zhengzhou plant in central China, which employs about 200,000 people, has been rocked by discontent over stringent measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, with several workers fleeing the site over the weekend.

The possible impact on production comes amid a traditionally busy time for electronics makers ahead of the year-end holiday season, which is also a prime time for vendors such as Apple.

Foxconn on Sunday said it was bringing the situation under control and would coordinate back-up production with other plants to reduce any potential impact. Its share price closed down 1.4% on Monday versus a 1.3% rise in the broader market (.TWII).

Apple did not respond to a request for comment.

Foxconn is Apple's biggest iPhone maker, producing 70% of iPhone shipments globally, which in turn makes up 45% of the Taiwanese firm's revenue, analysts at Taipei-based Fubon Research said this month.

It also builds the device in India, but its Zhengzhou factory assembles the majority of its global output.

A second person familiar with the situation said many workers remained at the Zhengzhou plant and that production was continuing.

STRICT COVID-19 MEASURES

Under China's ultra-strict zero-COVID-19 policies, localities must act swiftly to quell outbreaks, with measures including full-scale lockdowns.

Factories in affected areas are often allowed to stay open on condition they operate under a ""closed loop"" system where staff live and work on-site. Businesses have said such arrangements pose numerous difficulties.

Foxconn on Oct. 19 banned dining at canteens at the Zhengzhou plant and required workers to eat meals in dormitories. It said production was normal.

The measures led to people who said they worked at the site venting frustration about their treatment and provisions via social media.

Scores fled the site over the weekend, with photographs and videos on social media purporting to show Foxconn staff trekking across fields in daytime and along roads at night. Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the posts.

Foxconn has not disclosed whether any workers at the Zhengzhou site had been diagnosed with COVID-19. Authorities have since Oct. 19 reported 264 locally transmitted COVID-19 cases in Zhengzhou, the capital of central Henan province.

Foxconn implemented closed loop measures in March and July this year at its smaller Shenzhen factory as cases in the southern city rose.

In May, the Shanghai plant of another Apple supplier, MacBook assembler Quanta Computer Inc (2382.TW), was also hit by worker chaos after the discovery of COVID-19 cases despite a closed-loop system being put in place.

Law firms Related documents IPad maker opposes ruling that ""Smart Keyboard"" is a generic phrase

Lawsuit says loss on trademark bid would cause consumer confusion















(Reuters) - Apple Inc is entitled to a federal trademark for its ""Smart Keyboard"" iPad accessory and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office was wrong to decide otherwise, the tech giant told a Virginia federal court in a lawsuit against the agency on Friday.

Apple said the PTO erred when it found that ""Smart Keyboard"" is a generic phrase instead of a distinctive name that customers would associate with Apple's accessory.

The PTO declined to comment. Representatives for Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.

Apple introduced the Smart Keyboard, an iPad cover that also functions as a keyboard and stand, in 2015. It applied for a federal trademark covering ""Smart Keyboard"" later that year.

The PTO rejected Apple's application in 2018, and the office's Trademark Trial and Appeal Board upheld the decision last year. The board said ""Smart Keyboard"" was a generic term for ""technologically advanced keyboards"" and could not be a registered trademark.

But Apple told the Alexandria, Virginia court Friday that the term ""Smart Keyboard"" had rarely been used to refer to anything other than Apple's accessory.

""This strongly indicates that consumers do not understand or use 'smart keyboard' as a generic 'everyday' term,"" Apple said. ""If it did, it would be used widely in the industry.""

Apple also said there are hundreds of other federal ""Smart"" trademarks, including marks that Apple owns for its ""Smart Cover,"" ""Smart Case,"" and ""Smart Connector"" iPad accessories.

Apple asked the court to force the PTO to register the ""Smart Keyboard"" trademark. The lawsuit said a ruling against the company could degrade Apple's brand and lead to consumer confusion.

The case is Apple Inc v. U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, No. 1:22-cv-01231, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.

525,697,APPLE,2022-10-31,"Swiss National Bank's balance sheet shrinks nearly 8% in Sept, data shows","













ZURICH, Oct 31 (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank's (SNB) balance sheet shrank by nearly 8% in September, data showed on Monday, as plunging valuations on its stock and bond investments and the high value of the Swiss franc reduced the value of its foreign investments.

The 55.4 billion Swiss franc ($55.4 billion) decline in the value of the central bank's foreign currency investments was the main reason for its balance sheet declining to 889.5 billion francs from 964.6 billion francs a month earlier.

The value of SNB's portfolio, which includes stocks in companies such as Starbucks (SBUX.O) and Apple (AAPL.O) as well as bonds, is adjusted every quarter to reflect their market value and every month to take into account exchange rate moves.

Bonds around the world have lost value as central banks, including the SNB, raised interest rates to combat inflation, while stock markets have dropped due to concerns over an end to easy money and an economic slowdown.

Earlier on Monday, the SNB reported how a plunge in value of its investments pushed the central bank into a nine month loss of 142.2 billion francs, the worst in its 115-year history and slightly more than the entire economic output of Morocco.

The balance sheet data on Monday also showed how the SNB has been mopping up excess liquidity in Switzerland as it aims to steer the market interest rate towards the policy rate of 0.5% it introduced at the end of September.

The SNB spent 55.3 billion francs on repurchase agreements (REPOS) and 17.8 billion francs on SNB bonds in September, which reduced the level of sight deposits to 540.5 billion francs from 639 billion in August, the data showed.

526,779,APPLE,2022-10-31,Responsible Minerals Initiative cuts ITSCI from approved traceability list,"













JOHANNESBURG, Oct 31 (Reuters) - The Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) removed ITSCI from its list of approved traceability schemes on Monday, meaning smelters sourcing minerals through ITSCI will have to do additional due diligence to meet RMI auditing requirements.

ITSCI, which is run by the International Tin Association, is a private sector scheme monitoring tin, tantalum, and tungsten mines in Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, and Burundi for human rights abuses such as child labour, and connection to conflict financing.

In an update posted on its website, RMI said it had previously based its approval of ITSCI on a 2018 assessment of the scheme from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development with a validity period of three years, which was extended but has now expired because it did not receive ""ITSCI's affirmative response to the RMI's invitations to reapply.""

In an email, ITSCI Programme Manager Mickael Daudin said the organisation would need more time to analyse the RMI statement before commenting.

A year ago, ITSCI told members, in a memo seen by Reuters, that the scheme had ""reservations"" around sharing information with RMI and protecting confidentiality.

RMI said the change will take effect on Jan. 1, 2023, with a six-month grace period for smelters after which they will have to show RMI auditors direct evidence of traceability, mine site assessments, supply chain risk assessments, and KYC (know your customer) procedures, or be labelled non-conformant.

The move by RMI could incentivise mineral exporters and smelters to more closely examine their supply chains, said Mike Loch, president of Chicago-based mineral due diligence firm Responsible Trade.

""It might drive some innovation, it might drive some companies to implement their own chain of custody,"" he said.

RMI, which has more than 400 member companies from Apple and Alphabet to Tesla and Walmart, develops tools and resources that companies use to make decisions on sourcing minerals.

527,72,APPLE,2022-10-31,Apple workers in Australia gear up for more strike action,"













SYDNEY, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Hundreds of Apple (AAPL.O) workers in Australia are set to strike again after almost two-thirds of employees rejected a pay and benefits deal, the latest escalation of a fight that has seen weeks of walkouts at stores around the country.

Results released on Monday show 68% of Apple workers rejected a workplace agreement proposed by management with 87% of Apple's almost 4,000 Australian workers participating. Apple declined to comment on the results.

Members of the Retail and Fast Food Workers Union (RAFFWU), one of three involved in negotiations and representing around 200 workers, will meet on Monday night and union representatives say more strikes will ""absolutely"" be discussed.

""Workers are very happy, they've been campaigning for a fair agreement for three months. Our members have been engaged in pretty serious work bans and strikes,"" RAFFWU secretary Josh Cullinan told Reuters by phone.

""We expect members will want to endorse a series of work stoppages.""

RAFFWU workers staged a one-hour walkout on Saturday, midway through the three-day ballot. It followed a full day strike earlier in October.

Negotiations began in August when Apple proposed a new set of locked-in wage rises and conditions that unions say mean real wage cuts and poor work-life balance.

Unions want Apple to guarantee wage increases that reflect inflation - which is tracking around 7% in Australia, more than double the central bank's target range - and weekends of two consecutive days rather than being split.

Apple says its minimum pay rates are 17% above the industry minimum and that full-time workers get guaranteed weekends.

528,297,APPLE,2022-11-01,Apple supplier Foxconn quadruples bonuses to staff hit by China COVID lockdown,"













Nov 1 (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) supplier Foxconn (2317.TW) said on Tuesday it has quadrupled bonuses on offer for workers at its Zhengzhou plant in central China as it seeks to quell discontent over COVID curbs and retain staff at the giant iPhone manufacturing site.

Daily bonuses for employees, who are part of a Foxconn unit responsible for making electronics including smartphones at the site, have been raised to 400 yuan ($55) a day for November from 100 yuan, according to the official WeChat account of Foxconn's Zhengzhou plant.

Foxconn, formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, is Apple's biggest iPhone maker, producing 70% of iPhone shipments globally. It makes most of the phones at the Zhengzhou plant where it employs about 200,000 people, though it has other smaller production sites in India and south China.

The Zhengzhou plant has been rocked by discontent over stringent measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, with several workers fleeing the site over the weekend after complaining about their treatment and provisions via social media.

Foxconn had no choice but to follow government instructions which had put workers in ""miserable conditions"", a person familiar with the situation on campus told Reuters, adding that the circumstances caught management by surprise.

""Initially there wasn't enough to eat or drink,"" said the source, who declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media. Essential supplies had since been shipped into the Foxconn campus after the shortage triggered ""a sense of anxiety"", the source added.

The plant had faced capacity constraints in isolating those infected, a Foxconn manager who oversees more than 1,000 workers told a unit of financial news outlet Yicai.

Panic also spread among workers due to rumours on social media and perceptions they were at risk of severe illness should they catch the virus, said the unnamed manager.

The original bonus scheme was initially outlined in an article on Monday by government-backed Henan Daily, citing a senior unnamed Foxconn executive.

Foxconn has not disclosed whether any workers at the Zhengzhou site had been diagnosed with COVID-19 but the executive told the newspaper there had been no severe infections and the company had set up a team to transfer infected staff to quarantine.

Foxconn did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Henan Daily article. The Henan Daily is the official newspaper of Henan province, of which Zhengzhou is the capital.

Reuters was not immediately able to reach the Zhengzhou government by fax or phone for comment on Tuesday. On Sunday, the city said authorities had sent in teams to the plant to help the company carry risk assessments and deal with the situation.

15,000 YUAN BONUS

Reuters reported on Monday, citing a source, that the production of iPhones in November could slump by as much as 30% at the plant due to the situation and that Foxconn was working to boost production at another factory in Shenzhen to make up for the shortfall.

Foxconn's shares (2317.TW) closed down 1% on Tuesday, lagging a 0.4% rise in the broader index (.TWII).

Foxconn's notice on Tuesday also said those who work for more than 25 days could get a maximum bonus of 5,000 yuan for the month, up from previous maximum of 1,500 yuan, as part of an effort to ""gradually resume orderly production"" and to ""thank our fellow employees' persistence.""

Those who put in their ""full effort"" during November, including forgoing any leave, could be paid a total bonus of over 15,000 yuan for the month, the notice added.

A typical Foxconn worker makes between 3,000 to 4,000 yuan a month.

A worker told Reuters on Tuesday she had decided to quit despite the bonuses on offer because what they had faced was ""horrible"". However, some of her colleagues were convinced to stay for the extra money, she added.

China's zero approach towards COVID-19 requires localities to act swiftly to curb outbreaks with measures including lockdowns, but it allows factories in affected areas to stay open on condition they operate under a ""closed loop"" system where staff live and work on-site.

However, businesses have complained about the difficulties of the system and the toll on staff.

The senior executive cited by the Henan Daily said Foxconn started carrying out daily COVID testing for its staff at the site on Oct. 10, and three days later implemented the closed loop system by moving staff living off-site into its dormitories.

529,827,APPLE,2022-11-01,Google pauses enforcing proprietary billing system in India after antitrust order,"[1/2] A Huawei smartphone is seen in front of displayed Google Play logo in this illustration taken May 20, 2019. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration















NEW DELHI, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google is pausing the enforcement of a policy that requires app developers in India to use its proprietary billing system for selling digital goods, following a ruling by the country's antitrust body.

Google had previously set an extended deadline of Oct. 31 for developers in India to integrate apps with its Google Play billing system, which collects a commission that ranges from 15%-30% for each sale.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI), however, ordered Google last week not to restrict app developers from using third-party billing or payment processing services in India, while fining it $113 million.

In a website update to developers on Tuesday, Google said the requirement to use its billing system still applied for users outside the country, adding it was reviewing legal options in India.

Last week, Reuters reported that Google was planning a legal challenge to block a separate CCI ruling that demanded a change in its approach to the Android operating system.

Globally, Google and Apple have faced criticism that the fees charged at their mobile app stores are needlessly high and cost developers collectively billions of dollars a year. Both have lowered fees in many circumstances and have said they are needed to fund a safe and secure mobile ecosystem.

""Today's decision helps protect our revenues. We hope that Google implements this permanently as it's not good for Indian digital startups - it amounts to digital tax for us,"" said Murugavel Janakiraman, the CEO of BharatMatrimony Group, which run various apps that help people find life partners.

Nearly 97% of India's 600 million smartphones run on Google's Android mobile operating system, and startups have banded together in the past to say the payment policy hurt their businesses.

Google on its part has begun to allow alternative payment systems in countries including India on a pilot basis, charging lower commissions.

530,748,APPLE,2022-11-01,China aims to ship 25 million virtual reality devices by 2026,"













HONG KONG, Nov 1 (Reuters) - China released its first action plan dedicated to virtual reality on Tuesday, with an aim its industry ship more than 25 million devices with a value exceeding 350 billion yuan ($48.20 billion) by 2026.

It was published by five ministries in Beijing, led by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and categorised virtual reality as a key industry for the digital economy under the country's 14th five-year plan.

The paper includes augmented reality and mixed reality in its definition of virtual reality.

This first action plan reflects Beijing’s ambition to lead the world in virtual technology and sets detailed goals.

It did not specify whether the 25 million devices target referred to annual or accumulative shipments between now and 2026.

In the first half of this year, China shipped just over half a million virtual reality and augmented reality devices, research firm IDC said.

The plan also includes a target to increase the total value of the industry to more than 350 billion yuan, which the ministries say includes hardware and software sales.

It added that China will need to nurture 100 core companies and form 10 public service platforms for the industry by 2026.

The China Academy of Information and Communications, a state-backed think tank, published a report on Tuesday saying that China's motivation for the action plan should be seen in the context of the U.S. and South Korea governments having identified virtual reality as an important industry.

It also makes reference to global tech giants including Meta (META.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Google (GOOGL.O) and Tencent , citing them as companies rapidly pursuing virtual reality opportunities.

531,227,APPLE,2022-11-02,"Apple distributor Redington Q2 profit up as India sales of phones, laptops rise","













BENGALURU, Nov 2 (Reuters) - (This Nov. 2 story has been corrected to fix the company descriptor from Apple reseller to Apple distributor in the headline and paragraph 3)

India's biggest Apple and IT products distributor Redington Ltd (REDI.NS) on Thursday reported a 26% jump in September quarter profit on the back of buoyant domestic demand for phones, laptops and software.

Consolidated profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 climbed to 3.87 billion rupees ($46.76 million) from 3.07 billion rupees a year ago, the company said in an exchange filing.

The iPhone distributor's quarterly revenue rose to 190.51 billion rupees from 152.87 billion rupees a year ago, per the filing. Apple, its single largest vendor, accounted for 27% of the revenue.

India distribution business continued to post double digit growth, Redington said. The company also caters to Singapore, Turkey, the Middle East and the African continent. Meanwhile, the share of revenue from mobility devices rose to 25% from 23% a year ago.

The pandemic benefited companies like Redington, which sells everything from smartphones to personal computers and software to consumers and businesses across 38 countries, as it led to spike in demand with most enterprises embracing work from home.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), or core earnings, grew nearly 23% to 5.62 billion rupees, the company said in an investor presentation.

Redington shares rose as much as 11.2% to 152.70 rupees after the earnings.

532,78,APPLE,2022-11-02,China imposes fresh lockdown around major Apple iPhone plant,"













Nov 2 (Reuters) - China ordered an industrial park that houses an iPhone factory belonging to Foxconn (2317.TW) to enter a seven-day lockdown on Wednesday, in a move set to intensify pressure on the Apple supplier as it scrambles to quell worker discontent at the base.

The Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone in central China said it would impose ""silent management"" measures with immediate effect, including barring all residents from going out and only allowing approved vehicles on roads within that area.

The curbs will last until Nov. 9, it said. The lockdown marks a re-tightening of measures in Zhengzhou, which unexpectedly lifted a quasi-lockdown on its nearly 13 million residents the day before. The city reported 358 locally transmitted cases for Tuesday, up from 95 the day before.

Relentless controls and spot lockdowns across China have fuelled discontent among residents, hampered economic growth and taken a heavy psychological and financial toll on people and companies.

Foxconn, formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, is Apple's biggest iPhone maker, accounting for 70% of iPhone shipments globally. It makes most of the phones at the Zhengzhou plant where it employs about 200,000 people, though it has other smaller production sites in India and south China.

The industrial park's notice did not specify how the measures might be applied to Foxconn, but the move could impact the transport of goods in and out of the complex.

Foxconn told Reuters in a statement that its campus there continued operating under a ""closed-loop management"" system, referring to a bubble-like arrangement commonly imposed as part of virus prevention measures in China, where employees sleep, live and work isolated from the wider world.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Foxconn has been working to retain staff and smooth over tensions in the factory, after workers complained about their treatment and provisions under COVID-19 prevention measures. Several employees also fled the factory, prompting Foxconn to offer generous bonuses to retain staff. read more

Market research firm TrendForce said it had cut its iPhone shipments forecast for the fourth quarter by 2-3 million units, from 80 million previously, due to the troubles at the Zhengzhou plant, adding that its investigation of the situation found that the factory's capacity utilization rates were now around 70%.

It believed Foxconn's production of the iPhone Pro and Pro Max models would continue exclusively at the Zhengzhou base in the short-term but that Apple was planning to spread the series' production-related risks by diverting orders to rival makers Luxshare (002475.SZ) and Pegatron (4938.TW), it added.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the TrendForce report, while Foxconn declined comment.

Reuters reported earlier this week that the plant's November output could fall by 30% due to the COVID situation and that Foxconn was working to boost production at another factory in Shenzhen. read more

The park also locked down in late April for 14 days. Foxconn said at the time that its production at the plant was normal. read more

533,775,APPLE,2022-11-02,China's Nio suspends production due to COVID measures,"













BEIJING, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Nio (9866.HK) said on Wednesday it has suspended production due to COVID-19 curbs as rising cases across the country cause more disruptions to business activity, triggering a steep drop in its shares.

Local tech news outlet 36Kr reported that Nio had begun to face production challenges in mid-October due to virus prevention measures that eventually led to both of its factories in the central city of Hefei stopping work.

""The news that production at Nio's factories has been temporarily suspended is true and this will have an impact on production and delivery schedules,"" a company representative told Reuters in response to a query about the report.

Shares of Nio fell as much as 7.5% to HK$75.50. The company was ranked No. 13 among the top selling electric vehicle makers in China based on Jan-Sept car sales, according to the China Passenger Car Association.

Nio's production suspension comes as China battles a rising number of cases in several major cities with lockdowns and stringent curbs that have disrupted travel and fuelled worker discontent at major Apple supplier (AAPL.O) Foxconn (2317.TW).

Hefei's latest outbreak begun in early October, prompting the authorities to put parts of the city under lockdown at various times, including the district where Nio's plants are located.

Nio apologised to its customers on Monday in a statement disclosing its October delivery figures for delayed deliveries, saying its production base had been severely impacted by the pandemic. It said that 10,059 vehicles were delivered in October, down 7.5% from September's 10,878.

Nio was also forced to suspend production in April after COVID curbs caused many of its supplier partners to stop work. read more

534,491,APPLE,2022-11-02,Qualcomm revenue forecast falls short as smartphone sales slump; shares slide,"













Nov 2 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc's (QCOM.O) forecast for holiday-quarter revenue fell about $2 billion short of Street estimates, as the chipmaker struggles with a slump in sales to smartphone customers, sending its shares down 7% in after-hours trading.

The company also projected a lower-than-expected profit for the quarter, and said it expected a low double-digit percentage decline in handset volumes this year, compared with its prior forecast of a mid-single-digit percentage drop.

Qualcomm's disappointing forecast comes shortly after both Intel Corp(INTC.O) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) cut their earnings estimates, in a sign that the slump in demand is plaguing the wider industry.

Qualcomm's forward PE valuation sinks to record low

Chipmakers including Texas Instruments (TXN.O) and Micron Technology (MU.O) have also raised concerns about a sharp drop in demand from electronics companies as consumer curb their discretionary spend due to decades-high inflation, rising interest rates and fears of an economic slowdown.

A recovery in the smartphone market could be pushed to the second half of 2023 from the first half, IDC analyst Nabila Popal said.

""Demand has dropped globally, but very much so in China as well as in emerging markets. This is what's actually pulling (down) the smartphone market the most,"" she said.

The easing of chip shortages and supply-chain bottlenecks in recent quarters has led to excess inventory at smartphone makers, with Qualcomm estimating about eight to 10 weeks worth of ""elevated inventory"" that could take a couple of quarters to work through.

Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer Akash Palkhiwala said the holiday-quarter could be the bottom in terms of inventory as manufacturers use up their existing chips.

Revenue from Qualcomm's handsets business, which accounts for more than half its total sales, rose 40% in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 25, although revenue from chips that enable WiFi and Bluetooth connections fell by a fifth.

It was not all doom and gloom for Qualcomm as it won more business from Apple (AAPL.O), which the chipmaker has been trying to rely less on, and said the company would start to see benefits from its increased share of chips Samsung (005930.KS) uses in the March quarter.

Qualcomm said it was now expecting to have the vast majority of 5G modem share for the 2023 iPhone launch, up from a previous assumption of 20%. It also said on a post-earnings call that it was assuming minimal contribution from Apple in fiscal 2025.

""We believe Apple will drive some growth in the December quarter ... but the Android market is extremely weak and many new premium-tier foldable models that were launched a few months ago did not sell well at all,"" said Kinngai Chan, analyst at Summit Insights Group.

The company is also facing stiffer competition from Taiwanese chipmaker MediaTek (2454.TW) in the higher-end Android market, said Runar Bjørhovde, research analyst at Canalys.

Qualcomm forecast current-quarter revenue between $9.2 billion and $10 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $12.02 billion, according to Refinitiv. It expects adjusted earnings per share of between $2.25 and $2.45, versus expectations of $3.42.

To cope with the tough macroeconomic environment, Qualcomm Chief Executive Cristiano Amon told analysts the company had implemented a hiring freeze and would make further cuts to operating expenses as needed.

BEIJING, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio (9866.HK) said on Thursday it has resumed production at its two factories in the eastern city of Hefei, after COVID-19 curbs disrupted operations and delayed deliveries.

""Production is resumed at the moment,"" said a company representative, declining to say whether it was a full or partial resumption.

China is battling a rising number of cases in several major cities with lockdowns and stringent curbs that have disrupted travel and fuelled worker discontent at major Apple(AAPL.O) supplier Foxconn (2317.TW).

Nio said on Wednesday it had suspended production because of COVID curbs, leading to delays in deliveries when sales are booming, triggering a steep drop in its shares.

Hefei's latest outbreak begun in early October, prompting the authorities to put parts of the city under lockdown at various times, including the district where Nio's plants are located.

Nio sold 10,059 cars last month, nearly three times its sales from October 2021, after introducing new models such as ET5. For the first 10 months, its sales grew 32%.

536,776,APPLE,2022-11-03,How mixing farms with forests can help the UK reach net zero,"Summary Planting trees on working farms can curb emissions, boost income

About 3% of UK farmland combines trees with crops or livestock

Farmers say money and time are biggest challenges to upscaling















PETERBOROUGH, England, Nov 3 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Stephen Briggs popped open his pocket knife, carved a wedge from a small pink and green apple and took a bite.

""Those are ready,"" he said, looking at a nearby apple tree, one of 4,500 planted in neat rows through wheat fields on his farm near Peterborough, in eastern England.

The wheat had been harvested a couple of weeks earlier, but Briggs welcomed the added work of apple picking - and the extra income it provides.

He is among a small group in Britain working to revive the ancient practice of agroforestry, or growing trees on the same piece of land as field crops or livestock pasture for economic and ecological benefit.

The farming method all but disappeared in Britain in the wake of World War Two, when the government, under pressure to feed a rapidly growing population, paid food producers to switch to single-crop farming methods.

But agriculture experts say it is poised to make a comeback as part of the government's tree-planting campaign to help meet its climate target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

""Nature doesn't do monoculture,"" said Briggs, an early adopter of the practice who is advising the government on agroforestry standards.

""We're taking some of the best practices of forestry and mixing them with agriculture to embed diversity, to be resilient, but in a way that we can still manage.""

In a report released this week, the Woodland Trust, a British conservation charity, said planting 30% of British grass pastureland with trees could produce net-zero carbon emissions from pasture-raised livestock by 2050.

Britain has committed more than 500 million pounds ($560 million) to planting 30,000 hectares (about 74,000 acres) of trees per year between 2020 and 2025.

About 70% of the country's total area is agricultural land, but currently only a little more than 3% of British land is used for some form of agroforestry, according to Paul Burgess, an agroforestry professor at England's Cranfield University.

In its 2020 report, the government's Committee on Climate Change recommended increasing the area of farmland that incorporates trees to 10%, saying it could cut planet-warming emissions by six metric tons per year by 2050.

Burgess noted that planting trees on agricultural land can cut more emissions than planting trees on non-agricultural land, with trees in some cases leading to reduced fertiliser use or a lower density of beef cattle, a key source of climate changing emissions.

But even proponents of agroforestry say making the practice more widespread will not be easy - not least because there is a lack of available trees to plant.

""If agroforestry was to take off at the level that we would all like to see, we don't have the tree supply (nationally),"" said Helen Chesshire, lead farming advocate for the Woodland Trust, which gives grants to farmers to plant trees.

""Currently, we have a bottleneck.""

FARMING OVER FORESTS

Farming with trees in a multi-crop system is not a new idea. People have used the technique for thousands of years, including on the British Isles, and it is still the method of choice on vast swathes of the planet.

Farmers and other agricultural experts say agroforestry boosts biodiversity, aiding vital pollinators like bees and birds, while reducing instances of pest and disease infestation for both plant crops and livestock.

For instance, spreading fruit or nut trees throughout a crop field, rather than grouping them together in an orchard, makes it harder for disease to jump from tree to tree.

The practice also slows land degradation as trees store nutrients and water in the ground and protect soil against wind erosion, as well as buffering crops against flooding.

All can help counter the effects of rising temperatures and intensifying drought, experts say.

Despite the benefits of multi-crop systems, a range of European and UK agricultural policies, starting in 1962, incentivised farmers to clear trees to grow more monocrops, said Briggs, the Cambridgeshire farmer.

That created ""a chasm"" between agriculture and forestry, he said, which over the past decade a coalition of farmers, ecologists and nonprofits have been lobbying the British government to close.

Since the United Kingdom left the European Union in 2020, all four of its national governments have announced the development of agroforestry standards and payment programmes to encourage more trees on farms.

""The government now seems to at least accept that trees on farms are no longer an issue, that they are part of the farming system,"" said Chesshire of the Woodland Trust.

'CHANGE IS A CHALLENGE'

Advocates say policy incentives are the crucial first step to upscaling agroforestry.

Tackling the country's tree shortage will take time, said Chesshire, noting that the trees should be cultivated domestically to avoid importing invasive species or diseases that could risk the entire system.

The next step, supporters say, is raising basic awareness of agroforestry techniques.

""People make the mistake … of assuming that farmers are foresters, and they aren't. Change is a challenge for them,"" said David Brass, CEO of The Lakes Free Range Egg Company in Cumbria.

The Lakes sources eggs from more than 70 farms and requires all of its producers to have 20% of the area their hens range in covered in trees, Brass explained.

The company provides initial payments to many reluctant farmers to plant trees and pays a ""significant premium"" for ongoing maintenance, he said.

On his own farm, Brass said his investment paid for itself within the first two years. Hen mortality dropped and egg quality increased.

As descendants of jungle fowl, chickens are happier and more secure among trees, he said, adding that trees also shield the animals from increasingly extreme temperatures.

TIME FOR A REVIVAL

Another challenge farmers face when looking to move into agroforestry is time. Trees can take anywhere from five to 70 years to mature, depending on the species.

""Asking tenant (farmers) to invest in trees if they have a five-year tenancy and apples take beyond five years to get anywhere near a return is problematic,"" said Matthew Heard, an ecologist in charge of environmental research at the National Trust, Britain's largest private landowner.

""That's where stepping up as a landlord is really important.""

In addition to adjusting lease terms so landlords offer longer tenancies, farmers also want the government to extend its sustainable farming payment scheme from covering three years at a stretch to eight years, in light of the multi-year financial risk they take until trees are established.

For all the challenges, agroforestry advocates say the boost for food security and economic productivity, as well as the environmental benefits, far outweigh the costs.

On his farm, Briggs pointed to a petrified tree trunk on the edge of a field.

""Before we farmed the area, there were trees here,"" he said. ""We have to put trees back into the landscape in a way we can manage. This is what the land returns to.""

REUTERS/Yves Herman/















DUBLIN, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Ireland will nominate Paschal Donohoe to serve a second term as president of the Eurogroup even though he will no longer be Ireland's finance minister when his term in Europe comes to an end in January, the government said on Friday.

Donohoe was appointed chair of the group of euro zone finance ministers in July 2020 and the government said in a statement that if re-elected, he will carry out his duties as Ireland's public expenditure minister.

Dublin said it would then have two representatives at the meetings as Donohoe is due to swap positions with current expenditure minister Michael McGrath in December as part of a coalition deal agreed shortly before he became Eurogroup chief.

While this could potentially complicate his re-election bid as the Eurogroup chief is usually a sitting finance minister, Luxembourg had two representatives while Jean-Claude Juncker was head of the influential group.

The Eurogroup played a key role coordinating policy during the financial crises of the last decade, ultimately helping to avoid the collapse of the common currency. Holding the chair has added to Ireland's influence in the bloc.

It has allowed Donohoe to play an important role in negotiations to overhaul global corporate tax rules that could be particularly damaging for Ireland as it is the low-tax European headquarters for big multinational employers including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O) and Facebook (META.O).

The Eurogroup will invite euro zone governments to submit candidates for the job at a meeting in Brussels on Monday.

Nov 4 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) Taiwanese contract manufacturer Pegatron Corp (4938.TW) has begun assembling the new iPhone 14 in India, Bloomberg News reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The report comes as relentless controls and spot lockdowns across China, where majority of Apple's iPhones are manufactured, have hampered economic growth and taken a heavy psychological and financial toll on residents and companies. read more

Meanwhile, Foxxconn (2317.TW), formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, began production of iPhone 14 in India in September, making Pegatron the second producer of the model in India, Bloomberg report added.

All of Apple's biggest Taiwanese suppliers, Foxconn, Pegatron and Wistron Corp (3231.TW) , have ramped up iPhone assembly in India, boosted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's financial incentives program, Bloomberg said.

India and other countries such as Mexico and Vietnam are increasingly turning important to contract manufacturers supplying to American brands amid COVID-related lockdowns in China and simmering tensions between Washington and Beijing.

China on Wednesday ordered an industrial park in the city of Zhengzhou that houses an iPhone factory belonging to Foxconn to enter a seven-day lockdown. read more

541,379,APPLE,2022-11-07,IPhone plant woes are least of Apple’s problems,"













NEW YORK, Nov 7 (Reuters Breakingviews) - There are many ways to slice Apple (AAPL.O). The $2.2 trillion technology giant has warned that woes caused by a Covid-19 outbreak at its supplier, Foxconn (2317.TW), could cut into production. But problems there look pale in comparison to other issues caused by Apple’s own consumers.

The company led by Tim Cook warned on Nov. 6 that disruption at the Zhengzhou complex has lowered shipments of high-end iPhone 14 Pro phones. Foxconn is responsible for some 70% of all iPhones according to Fubon Research, and most of these phones are made in that plant. Production could fall up to 30% according to a Reuters’ source. It’s bad timing, because customers ordering high-end phones now already have to wait until the first or second week in December. More delays could mean fewer iPhones sold during the holidays.

Still, in context, it should be manageable. Apple sold about 35% of all iPhones last year during the holiday quarter, so if the complex’s problems last one month, about 12% of the sales would be disrupted. Take Foxconn’s 70% share of production into account, and roughly a third loss at Zhengzhou, and just 2.5% of iPhone sales would take a hit. With iPhones accounting for just over half of revenue in the same quarter last year, that adds up to a roughly 1% loss to revenue.

It’s not ideal, but Apple’s kingdom isn’t really threatened by supply. More worrisome are other nagging problems, like slowing demand. Apple recently put on ice plans to increase production of the newly launched iPhone 14. A slowdown in the growth for handheld device was partly expected, but losses there were meant to be made up by the sale of other stuff, like advertising, apps, credit cards, and license fees from Google. But last quarter, sales of services rose just 5%, a huge step back from the 25% jump in sales in the same quarter in 2021.

The problem for investors is that Apple’s valuation has increased substantially on the idea that the company can continue milking more money out of iPhone users in a largely mature smartphone market. The company is now valued at 22 times estimated earnings for the next 12 months, or nearly 30% more than its average over the past decade. A disruption to production is never good, but right now, it’s the least of Apple’s problems.

CONTEXT NEWS

Apple warned on Nov. 6 that shipments of iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max have been disrupted by production woes at a Hon Hai Precision Industry complex in Zhengzhou, China. Reuters reported on Oct. 31 that production at the complex could fall 30%, according to an unnamed source.

In a statement on Oct. 30, Hon Hai, commonly known as Foxconn, said the situation was gradually coming under control, and it would coordinate backup production capacity with its other plants to reduce any impact.

TAIPEI, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Taiwan's exports likely contracted in October for the second month in a row, amid fears of a global recession, uncertainties due to the war in Ukraine, and COVID-19 flare-ups in China, according to a Reuters poll.

Taiwan, a global hub for chip production and a key supplier to Apple Inc (AAPL.O), is one of Asia's leading exporters of technology goods. The trade data is seen as an important gauge of world demand for tech gadgets.

Exports last month were estimated to have dropped 6% from a year earlier, a Reuters poll of 22 analysts showed on Monday, slightly faster than the 5.3% contraction in September. read more

The export forecasts varied widely between an expansion of 2.14% and a contraction of 13.4%, reflecting uncertainties over the global economy, supply chain disruptions due to pandemic lockdowns and power shortages in China, as well as the fallout from Russia's invasion of the Ukraine.

Taiwan's finance ministry had predicted October exports could contract in a range of 3% to 6% from a year earlier.

Separately, the consumer price index was expected to have risen 2.7% in October from a year earlier, a slower rate than 2.75% in September, according to the poll.

The trade and inflation data will both be released on Tuesday.

543,663,APPLE,2022-11-07,German industry calls for delay to global minimum tax - BDI,"













BERLIN, Nov 7 (Reuters) - German industry has called for a delay to a global minimum corporate tax by at least a year to 2025 to give companies more time to prepare given the current crisis, according to a position paper published by industry association BDI on Monday.

""The ambitious timetable of applying the minimum tax as early as 2024 is not realistic against the background of the enormous complexity of the associated new regulations,"" BDI said.

The shake-up, the biggest overhaul of cross-border tax rules in a generation, which nearly 140 countries agreed to last year, aims to take better account of the emergence of big digital companies, such as Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) that can book profits in low-tax countries.

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which has been shepherding the global minimum tax, had said in July that the new rules were on course to take effect in 2024.

BDI said implementation of the new rules and the preparation of IT processes would be very time-consuming and resource-consuming for companies, calling for a simplification of the process, for transitional arrangements and for a postponement until at least 2025.

It also rejected the idea that Germany could implement the minimum tax without legislation being passed across the European Union.

The governments of the EU's five biggest economies, including Germany, said last month they would implement the new tax rules next year by ""any possible legal means"" if Hungary does not lift its opposition at the EU level.

BDI said that going it alone would harm the competitiveness of the German economy as it would generate costs for German parent companies.

Summary Companies China's Oct exports, imports shrink unexpectedly

Frail data further blow to struggling economy

Global recession risks, COVID curbs in China darken outlook

Analysts expect further weakness in exports and imports















BEIJING, Nov 7 (Reuters) - China's exports and imports unexpectedly contracted in October, the first simultaneous slump since May 2020, as a perfect storm of COVID curbs at home and global recession risks dented demand and further darkened the outlook for a struggling economy.

The bleak data highlights the challenge for policymakers in China as they press on with pandemic prevention measures and try to navigate broad pressure from surging inflation, sweeping increases in worldwide interest rates and a global slowdown.

Outbound shipments in October shrank 0.3% from a year earlier, a sharp turnaround from a 5.7% gain in September, official data showed on Monday, and well below analysts' expectations for a 4.3% increase. It was the worst performance since May 2020.

The data suggests demand remains frail overall, and analysts warn of further gloom for exporters over the coming quarters, heaping more pressure on the country's manufacturing sector and the world's second-biggest economy grappling with persistent COVID-19 curbs and protracted property weakness.

Chinese exporters weren't even able to capitalise on a prolonged weakening in the yuan currency since April and the key year-end shopping season, underlining the broadening strains for consumers and businesses worldwide.

The yuan on Monday eased 0.4% from a more than one-week high against the dollar reached in the previous session, as the weak trade data and Beijing's vow to continue with its strict zero-COVID strategy hurt sentiment.

""The weak export growth likely reflects both poor external demand as well as the supply disruptions due to COVID outbreaks,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, citing COVID disruptions at a Foxconn factory, a major Apple supplier, as one example.

Apple Inc (AAPL.O) said it expects lower-than-anticipated shipments of high-end iPhone 14 models following a key production cut at the virus-blighted Zhengzhou plant.

""Looking forward, we think exports will fall further over the coming quarters... We think that aggressive financial tightening and the drag on real incomes from high inflation will push the global economy into a recession next year,"" said Zichun Huang, economist at Capital Economics.

Growth of auto exports in terms of volume also slowed sharply to 60% year-on-year from 106% in September, according to Reuters calculations based on customs data, reflecting a transition from demand for goods to services in major economies.

Overall exports to China's major markets of the United States and European Union also slumped in October, off 12.6% and 9% year-on-year, respectively.

DOMESTIC WOES HAMPER GROWTH

Almost three years into the pandemic, China has stuck to a strict COVID-19 containment policy that has exacted a heavy economic toll and caused widespread frustration and fatigue.

Feeble October factory and trade figures suggested the economy is struggling to get out of the mire in the last quarter of 2022, after it reported a faster-than-anticipated rebound in the third quarter.

The Ukraine war, which sparked a surge in already high inflation globally, has added to geopolitical tensions and further dampened business activity.

Chinese policymakers pledged last week to prioritise economic growth and press on with reforms, easing fears that ideology could take precedence as President Xi Jinping began a new leadership term and disruptive lockdowns continued with no clear exit strategy in sight.

Tepid domestic demand, partly weighed down by fresh COVID curbs and lockdowns in October, hurt importers.

Inbound shipments declined 0.7% from a 0.3% gain in September, below a forecast 0.1% increase, marking the weakest outcome since August 2020.

The harsh impact on demand from strict pandemic measures and a property slump was also highlighted in a broad range of Chinese imports; purchases of soybeans declined to eight-year-lows last month while copper imports fell and coal imports slackened after hitting a 10-month high in September.

On top of the global slowdown, frail domestic consumption will put more strain on China's economy for a while yet, analysts say.

""Insufficient domestic demand is the main constraint on China's short-term recovery and long-term growth trajectory,"" said Bruce Pang, chief economist at Jones Lang Lasalle.

546,758,APPLE,2022-11-07,Ford's EV guru Field talks bottlenecks and opportunities,"













Nov 7 (Reuters) - An inadequate charging network and insufficient access to battery raw materials are critical bottlenecks that could shackle demand for electric vehicles, according to Ford Motor Co's (F.N) chief electrification executive on Monday.

""Infrastructure is the biggest thing that really has to be nailed for widespread adoption"" of EVs, Doug Field said at an EV conference in London. ""A lot of coordination is going to be required to get the right levels of compatibility, capability, reliability in that charging network so people just don't have to worry about it.""

Field, who is chief advanced product development and technology officer for Ford's Model e, said vertical integration could be the key to solving potential shortages of battery raw materials.

Vertical integration is company founder Henry Ford's pioneering concept, revived in recent years by Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), of controlling as much of the industrial value chain as possible.

""The companies that go very, very far upstream, capture the materials years ahead of time, lock them up and build a clear strategy around the battery supply chain will win,"" said Field, a former Tesla and Apple Inc executive who started his career 35 years ago at Ford.

""This type of change is going to push companies to vertically integrate in ways that they haven't been used to in many, many decades.""

Field sketched a vision of future Ford vehicles ""doing things your phone can't do,"" including an immersive augmented reality (AR) experience while moving.

The automaker is continuing to develop hands-free driving, or ""conditional autonomy,"" and a more sophisticated user interface enabled by software and strategically placed cameras and speakers, Field said.

This will give Ford the opportunity to create ""an experience that will blow people away and (make them) feel like they're in a science fiction movie,"" he said.

547,439,APPLE,2022-11-08,"Netflix explores investing in live sports, bids for streaming rights- WSJ","













Nov 8 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) is exploring investments in live sports broadcasting and has recently bid for the streaming rights for sports leagues, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The company recently bid for the streaming rights for the ATP tennis tour for some European countries, including France and the U.K., but dropped out, the report said.

Netflix declined to comment, when contacted by Reuters.

The company also discussed bidding for other events, including U.K. rights to the Women's Tennis Association and cycling competitions, and was in talks late last year to acquire the World Surf League, the WSJ said.

Netflix executives have considered buying lower-profile leagues to avoid the mounting costs of bidding for sports rights, according to the report, while some of them believe they could boost lesser-known sports into franchises given the size of the platform.

The move comes as Netflix has been struggling to add new subscribers as competition from rivals including Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) increases. This month, Netflix launched an ad-backed tier in an attempt to boost revenue and subscriber growth.

Streaming platforms are also looking at live sports to gain market share in an already saturated market.

Disney and Liberty Media-owned Formula One extended their broadcast partnership last month, while Major League Soccer and Apple TV announced a partnership to stream every game on the app for the next decade. read more

Nov 8 (Reuters) - Lucid Group Inc (LCID.O) said on Tuesday orders for its luxury electric cars slipped in the third quarter from the second, partly due to canceled orders and people fearing long waiting period, sending shares down more than 10% after market hours.

The company said it had more than 34,000 orders in the reported period, down 3,000 reservations from the second quarter, after it delivered about 1,400 vehicles and saw cancellations.

Lucid said it had $3.85 billion in cash, which would sustain the company at least into the fourth quarter of next year.

""The combination of widening losses, a declining reservation count and its ongoing cash burn will do little to alleviate investor concerns surrounding the company,"" CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson said.

Chief Finance Officer Sherry House told Reuters in an interview that Lucid would tap into the capital markets as it looks to build a factory in Saudi Arabia.

The company separately said it would raise about $1.5 billion in total through a share sales program and an additional investment from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.

High prices for battery materials such as lithium, cobalt and nickel, exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have been eating into margins of electric vehicle makers, hurting their bottom line.

Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, which is Lucid's largest shareholder with a 61% stake, said last week that it would make electric cars in the kingdom under a joint venture named Ceer with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier Foxconn (2317.TW).

""There's no direct collaboration (with Ceer) technically, but I think there is a synergistic direction in terms of leveraging supply chain efficiencies,"" Lucid Chief Executive Officer Peter Rawlinson told Reuters.

Lucid's revenue rose to $195.5 million in the third quarter after it delivered 1,398 vehicles, up from 679 vehicles last quarter.

The company's net loss for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 widened to $670.2 million, or 40 cents per share, from $524.4 million, or 43 cents per share, a year earlier.

Summary Law firms

Law firms Related documents Intel sued Fortress for allegedly aggregating patents to shake down tech companies

Fortress-affiliated entity won nearly $2.2 billion from Intel in patent case















(Reuters) - Intel Corp failed to show that Fortress Investment Group LLC violated federal antitrust law by allegedly stockpiling patents and threatening tech companies with them, a U.S. appeals court said Tuesday.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a California federal court's decision to dismiss Intel's lawsuit, finding no evidence that SoftBank Group Corp-backed Fortress' conduct had anticompetitive effects.

Representatives for the companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Intel was hit with a $2.2 billion verdict last year in a Texas patent dispute with Fortress-affiliated VLSI Technology LLC. Intel fended off VLSI's bid for more than $3 billion more in a second infringement trial last year. A third Texas trial began Monday.

Intel and Apple Inc sued Fortress in 2019 for allegedly violating antitrust law by aggregating thousands of patents and using them to monopolize patent markets for specific technologies with licensing demands and litigation threats. Apple withdrew from the case last year, and U.S. District Judge Edward Chen dismissed the lawsuit months later.

Intel told the appeals court that the lower court had held it to an overly strict standard by ""refusing to draw the obvious conclusions from Intel's detailed allegations and demanding an unreasonably high degree of specificity"" in its complaint.

But a three-judge 9th Circuit panel upheld the district court's decision in a jointly written opinion.

""Intel does not allege any instance in which it has in fact paid higher royalties due to alleged patent aggregation,"" the appeals court said. The chipmaker also did not argue ""that an allegedly aggregated patent portfolio prevented it from making any product or practicing any technology, or that it has been denied any license.""

The court was also unconvinced by Intel's argument that Fortress' ""exorbitant"" litigation demands were evidence of an anti-competitive price increase in the patent market.

The case is Intel Corp v. Fortress Investment Group LLC, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-16817.

551,397,APPLE,2022-11-08,"As yen tumbles, gadget-loving Japan goes for secondhand iPhones","













TOKYO, Nov 8 (Reuters) - For years Japanese shoppers eagerly shelled out for the latest gadgets, but now a tumbling yen has put new iPhones out of reach for some and sparked a growing secondhand trade in a major market for Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

The Japanese currency's fall to a 32-year low against the dollar has squeezed consumers and accelerated a broader spending shift in the world's no.3 economy. Industry watchers say Japan's shoppers have become more open to buying secondhand, thanks in part to the rise of online auction sites.

In July, Apple hiked the price of the entry-level iPhone 13 by nearly a fifth. The basic iPhone 14 later debuted at 20% more than the iPhone 13 did, even as the U.S. price stayed flat at $799. While the dollar has surged against global currencies this year, the yen has been particularly hit, dropping 22%.

Salaryman Kaoru Nagase wanted a new phone but couldn't justify the price of a iPhone 14, which starts at 119,800 yen ($814). Instead, he bought a used iPhone SE 2 in Tokyo's Akihabara electronics district for less than a third of that.

""At more than 100,000 yen the iPhone 14 is too expensive and I just can't afford it. It would be fine if the battery lasted for 10 years,"" he said. The iPhone SE 2, released in 2020 but without the dual rear camera of the iPhone 14, was a ""good balance"" of cost and features, he said.

Apple declined to comment for this story. But in an annual regulatory filing last month, it said Japan sales fell 9% in the year ended September 24 due to the yen's weakness.

Apple Chief Financial Luca Maestri also acknowledged to analysts last month that the strong dollar had led to price increases for its products in some countries, but sales had still grown by double digits in Indonesia, Vietnam and other markets facing currency challenges.

Sales of used smartphones grew nearly 15% in Japan to a record 2.1 million in the last financial year and are likely to reach 3.4 million by 2026, according to technology market research firm MM Research Institute.

100,000 YEN BARRIER

Taishin Chonan bought a used iPhone 13 after the screen cracked on one of the two devices he carries for personal use. The replacement has higher resolution and a better battery and camera than the iPhone 7 he had been using.

""Up until now I'd only ever bought new phones, this is my first time buying used,"" the 23-year-old said. ""The new models are expensive.""

Even after the price hikes, the iPhone 14 sold in Japan is the cheapest among 37 countries when tax is taken into account, MM Research Institute said in a September survey. More yen weakness could prompt Apple to raise prices again, the research firm said, potentially denting its hefty 50% share of Japan's smartphone market.

The latest iPhones are now priced above the 100,000 yen level that is a ""major psychological barrier"" for many shoppers, said Daisuke Inoue, chief executive of Belong Inc, a unit of trading house Itochu Corp. (8001.T) that sells used phones and tablets online.

Average sales on Belong's Nicosuma e-commerce site have trebled since Apple raised prices in July compared to the average over the previous three months, Inoue said. At Belong's operations centre outside of Tokyo, shipments of used phones were unboxed and sorted before being inspected, graded and cleaned by rows of workers at long tables.

The phones were then photographed from multiple angles for sale online. Belong uses Itochu's global network to help it source used devices both in Japan and overseas, depending on where the best prices are, Inoue said.

Some of the devices are bought from businesses, such as tablets previously used for payments in cafes or displays in taxis, he said.

Many Japanese have traditionally been wary of secondhand items, including electronics, but that is changing.

Marketplace site Mercari has seen strong growth in sales of used smartphones, while sales of home appliances and electronics have also grown, a Mercari, Inc (4385.T) spokesperson said.

With Japan open again to foreign tourists, the secondhand iPhone market is getting another boost.

Retail chain Iosys Co Ltd has seen a surge in foreign tourists buying used iPhones in the last two months.

""The yen just keeps weakening,"" said Iosys executive Takashi Okuno. ""That trend of visiting Japan and buying an iPhone is coming back.""

Nov 9 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) were accused in an antitrust lawsuit on Wednesday of conspiring to drive up iPhone and iPad prices by removing nearly all other resellers of new Apple products from Amazon's website.

The proposed class action in Seattle federal court objected to an agreement that took effect in January 2019, under which Apple gave Amazon discounts of up to 10% on its products, in exchange for Amazon letting just seven of 600 resellers stay on its platform.

This transformed Amazon into the dominant reseller of new iPhones and iPads on its website, according to the complaint, after it had previously carried a limited number of Apple products as well as knockoffs.

Prices rose more than 10%, while Apple stabilized the prices it charged in retail stores, the complaint said. Discounts of 20% or more that were once common no longer are, it added.

""Erecting barriers to entry to keep competitors out and raising prices in the wake of their elimination is precisely the kind of conduct that Congress enacted antitrust laws to prevent,"" the complaint said. ""The case is open and shut.""

Apple and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The combined product revenue of Cupertino, California-based Apple and Seattle-based Amazon topped $125 billion in this year's third quarter.

Wednesday's lawsuit covers U.S. residents who bought new iPhones and iPads on Amazon since January 2019.

It seeks unspecified triple damages, restitution, and an end to the companies' alleged so-called ""group boycott.""

The named plaintiff, Steven Floyd of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, said he paid $319.99 for a new iPad he bought from Amazon on the company's website, and was denied a chance to pay less because competition had been stifled.

Last month, an Italian administrative court scrapped a 173.3 million euro ($173.6 million) fine against Apple and Amazon by Italy's antitrust regulator for alleged price collusion.

The case is Floyd v Amazon.com Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington, No. 22-01599.

553,157,APPLE,2022-11-09,Shares in Apple supplier Goertek tumble after client suspends order,"













HONG KONG, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Shares in Goertek Inc (002241.SZ) tumbled on Wednesday after the China-based electronics supplier said an overseas client had asked it to suspend assembly work for a smart acoustic product, which analysts identified as the Apple AirPods Pro 2.

Goertek said late on Tuesday it had received the notice from a ""major overseas client"". The suspension would impact up to 3.3 billion yuan ($455 million) in revenue, equivalent to about 4.2% of the company's total revenue in 2021, it said.

Shares in Goertek fell by their maximum, triggering a trading suspension in accordance with exchange rules.

In a note to clients, analysts from Jefferies said their inquiries had revealed that the product was the AirPods Pro 2, a wireless earphone set.

""The issue is more of a technical one, instead of a demand problem,"" Jefferies analysts wrote, adding that both Goertek and Luxshare had been impacted.

Another Apple supplier, Luxshare (002475.SZ), had been able to quickly fix the problem and resume production, but Goertek was still in the process of overcoming the difficulty, working with an Apple engineering team on site, they said.

""At the moment, there are no order cuts or Goertek being so-called 'kicked out' of the customer's supply chain,"" they said.

Ming-Chi Kuo, an Apple analyst at research firm TF Securities, said that, according to his checks, the product involved could be AirPods Pro 2. ""Goertek's suspension of production is more likely due to production issues rather than demand issues,"" he said.

Apple and Goertek, whose clients also include Meta Platforms (META.O), Samsung and Microsoft, did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

Shares in Luxshare (002475.SZ) and AAC Technologies (2018.HK) initially jumped as high as 4.6% and 14.6%, respectively, before paring gains. The two companies were up about 0.3% and 2.6%, respectively, near the end of the afternoon session.

Summary

Summary Companies Five of Guangzhou's 11 districts to undergo mass testing

Guangzhou's COVID-19 case load tops 2,000 for second day

Local cases in China reach highest level since April 30















BEIJING, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Millions of residents of China's southern manufacturing hub of Guangzhou were told on Wednesday to get tested for COVID-19, as infections topped two thousand for two days running in the city's worst outbreak so far.

As local cases across China reached their highest level since April 30, authorities announced on social media that five districts representing more than half Guangzhou's population of almost 19 million would need to undergo mass testing.

The latest round of mass testing in Guangzhou comes as China battles a rebound in infections in several economically vital cities, including the capital Beijing, as well as Zhengzhou and Chongqing, which have dampened hopes that the world's second-largest economy could ease curbs and restrictions soon.

Authorities are determined to get on top of the outbreaks and make good on President Xi Jinping's zero-COVID policy, without having to impose mass lockdowns of the sort that shut Shanghai earlier this year.

The districts in Guangzhou subject to mass testing this week include Haizhu, which has seen the bulk of the city's cases. A district-wide lockdown from Saturday to Monday has been extended to Friday as cases rise.

""My residential compound in Tianhe (district) has been locked up since yesterday,"" said Guangzhou resident Jason Li.

""I was suddenly notified by my compound. Residents were instructed not to leave our building.""

Li said he hadn't been told for how long his compound would be locked up.

""Thank god I've stocked up on groceries recently,"" he said.

Lily Li, a Guangzhou resident, said the outbreak in the city had worsened in the past two days, having spread to Tianhe, just north of Haizhu.

""Honestly, it's already a huge surprise that Tianhe hadn't been affected sooner,"" she said.

Guangzhou reported 2,637 new locally transmitted COVID cases for Nov. 8, up from 2,377 a day earlier amid the city's most serious outbreak to date and accounting for nearly a third of the 8,176 new local infections reported in China on the day.

ECONOMIC TOLL

In the latest sign of how anti-virus measures are crushing consumer demand, China's factory gate prices for October dropped for the first time since December 2020 and consumer inflation moderated, in part due to strict COVID curbs.

In central China, Apple (AAPL.O) supplier Foxconn (2317.TW) said it would continue to maintain closed-loop operations - a system where staff live on-site isolated from the wider world - at its iPhone plant even as the economic zone that housed the factory lifted a seven-day lockdown.

Foxconn has declined to disclose the number of infections or comment on the conditions of those infected. The issues at the plant have hit iPhone production, prompting Apple on Monday to say that it expects lower shipments of premium iPhone 14 models.

While COVID cases in China are small by global standards, the policy response has been relentless and mass testing for large populations has been the norm since 2020.

Mass testing is generally free, but some local governments are resuming charges for tests as their finances come under strain amid a slowing economy.

Even Chengdu, the sprawling capital of southwestern Sichuan province, will end free COVID tests after Nov. 30.

Reflecting the financial stress that COVID testing has inflicted on smaller cities, a COVID testing company in Xuchang, a city in Henan province, on Tuesday threatened to stop all testing-related work from Friday due to late payments from authorities. On Wednesday, the firm said the payment issue had been resolved and testing would go ahead.

555,726,APPLE,2022-11-09,Chipmaker TSMC plans Arizona factory expansion,"













Nov 9 (Reuters) - TSMC (2330.TW), the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major supplier to Apple Inc (AAPL.O), said on Wednesday it was constructing a building that could serve as its second chip factory in Arizona in the United States.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd said in an emailed statement to Reuters that it could use the building for future expansion but has not yet arrived on a final decision for a second chip manufacturing plant.

""In light of the strong customer demand we are seeing in TSMC's advanced technology, we will consider adding more capacity in Arizona with a second fab based on operating efficiency and cost economic considerations,"" the company said.

The Wall Street Journal first reported that TSMC's investment in Arizona is expected to be around $12 billion which it committed two years ago, citing sources.

Last year, Reuters reported TSMC's plans to build more chipmaking factories in Arizona, including discussions about whether its next plant should be a more advanced which could make chips with 3-nanometer technology compared to the slower, less-efficient 5-nanometer tech used in the existing factory.

The United States has been encouraging foreign tech firms to manufacture in the country and has actively supported local research, development and manufacturing after passing its CHIPS Act.

While the chips sector is bracing for waning demand as red-hot inflation squeezes spending, Taiwan faces a tougher situation - sandwiched between its largest export market China and its main international backer and arms supplier, the United States - especially as Beijing steps up military pressure to force Taipei to accept Chinese sovereignty claims. read more

556,732,APPLE,2022-11-09,Chinese iPhone plant still under strict COVID curbs despite lift of lockdown,"













BEIJING/TAIPEI, Nov 9 (Reuters) - An iPhone plant in China that has come to symbolise worker discontent with harsh COVID curbs will continue to isolate its operations and staff despite the lift of a seven-day lockdown for the rest of the industrial park in which it is located.

Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn (2317.TW) told Reuters on Wednesday its massive Zhengzhou plant in central China will maintain so-called closed-loop operations - a system where staff live and work on-site isolated from the wider world.

It did not say how long it expects the closed-loop system - imposed at the plant since mid-October - to remain in place.

The Zhengzhou plant is the world's largest iPhone factory with some 200,000 workers. In recent weeks, many have fled - their escapes captured on social media - frustrated over how COVID cases were handled and the treatment of employees including what they said were insufficient provisions of food.

The Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone - the industrial park housing the Foxconn plant and which has more than 600,000 residents in total - said it had lifted a district-wide lockdown as planned.

But it added that certain restrictions would remain especially in medium- to high-risk areas - defined in China as places where cases have recently been found or infected people have recently visited.

Its statement described an area that would be designated a ""control area"", whose residents would not be allowed to move around unless necessary. Reuters checks showed the area was the site of the Foxconn factory.

The curbs and discontent have hit production, prompting Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Monday to say that it expects lower shipments of premium iPhone 14 models. read more

557,866,APPLE,2022-11-09,Bumble tumbles after weak fourth-quarter revenue forecast on forex hit,"













Nov 9 (Reuters) - Online dating firm Bumble Inc (BMBL.O) forecast fourth-quarter revenue below Wall Street expectations, as it struggles with product launch delays at a time when inflation has hit users hard, sending its shares down 13% in extended trading.

""Some of our user segments are facing greater pressure on disposable income, and these segments are renewing their subscriptions at a modestly lower rate,"" Chief Executive Officer Whitney Wolfe Herd said on an earnings call.

A strong dollar and the Ukraine war has also taken a toll on the company's business, with third-quarter revenue falling short of both its own and Wall Street's expectations.

Adjusted for both foreign exchange and the Ukraine crisis, revenue growth would have been 10% higher, Herd said.

In the current-quarter, Bumble expects a forex hit of $16 million and a $5-million impact, primarily at its Badoo App and other revenue due to the ongoing war.

A more than 15% surge in the dollar this year has hit sales of companies across sectors, while the highest price pressures in decades have led consumers to curb non-essential spending.

Bumble also faces competition from larger rival Match Group Inc (MTCH.O), which topped revenue estimates last week on the back of a jump in paying users for its flagship app Tinder.

While the company saw a rise in popularity, its sister app Badoo, which is mostly used in Western Europe remains under pressure.

Earlier in March, Bumble said it is discontinuing operations in Russia, including the removal of all of its apps from Apple App Store and Google Play Store in Russia and Belarus. read more

Bumble now expects current-quarter revenue between $232 million and $237 million, compared to Wall Street's estimates of $254.5 million, according to Refinitiv data.

The company reported third-quarter profit of 14 cents per share compared with analysts' estimate of 1 cent per share, according to Refinitiv data.

Bumble, which made its market debut in February 2021, said its total paying users for the quarter increased to 3.3 million from 2.9 million last year.

Summary Companies Foxconn expects smartphone revenues to decline in Q4

Says working to ensure no COVID impact on holiday orders

Sees Q4 revenue flattish, with conservative 2023 outlook

Q3 profit T$38.8 bln vs T$41.3 bln market view















TAIPEI, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier Foxconn (2317.TW) said on Thursday it expected smartphone revenue to fall this quarter and is adjusting production to prevent recent COVID-19 curbs at a massive iPhone factory in China from impacting holiday orders.

Foxconn has grabbed headlines in recent weeks, with tight virus restrictions at its Zhengzhou plant, the world's largest iPhone factory, disrupting production and fuelling concerns over the impact of China's virus policy on global supply chains. The plant in China's industrial hub employs about 200,000 people.

Speaking on an earnings call, Chairman Liu Young-way said the Christmas and Lunar New Year holidays are ""very important.""

""We will definitely work all out to adjust our production capacity and output, so there is no impact on demand for these two holidays,"" Liu said. He did not give details.

The cost impact of the COVID controls, including offering bonuses to retain workers, will be short term and Foxconn has been working with the government to resume normal production as soon as possible, he added.

On Wednesday, Foxconn said it would continue production in Zhengzhou under a ""closed loop"" system, where staff live and work on-site in a bubble isolated from the wider world. read more .

Many employees have fled the factory over the rigid controls which have limited people's movement and seen enforced quarantine, with stories of food and medical shortages circulating on social media.

If disruptions persist, it could hamper Foxconn's ability to ship iPhones in what is traditionally the peak season for Taiwan tech firms as they race to supply cellphones and other electronics for the year-end holiday period in Western markets followed by the Lunar New Year in East Asia.

When asked if customers are pushing for production to be distributed to other Chinese cities or outside of China, Liu said that geopolitics is more likely to play a role in restructuring Foxconn's production footprint than the pandemic.

""Of course there may be other factors that require the reconfiguration of production capacity, such as geopolitics,"" Liu said.

COVID OVERSHADOWS OUTLOOK

The Taiwanese company, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said net profit for the July-September quarter rose 5% to T$38.8 billion from T$36.98 billion a year earlier.

Eleven analysts were expecting on average profit of T$41.3 billion, according to Refinitiv.

Having said on Monday it would ""revise down"" its fourth quarter outlook given the situation in Zhengzhou, Foxconn said revenue in the final three months of this year would be flattish. It had a relatively conservative outlook for 2023.

Foxconn said it expects a slight decline in fourth-quarter revenues year-on-year for its smart consumer electronics business, which includes smartphones, and significant growth for cloud and network products.

It also forecast strong growth for fourth-quarter revenues in computing products, which includes laptops.

Shares of Foxconn, which has a market value of $43.6 billion, closed down 2% ahead of the earnings release, lagging a 1% drop in the broader market (.TWII).

Foxconn's disappointing earnings come at a time when investors are concerned about slowing tech demand due to high inflation and escalating global supply chain issues due in part to China's COVID policy, with no clear exit strategy in sight.

Apple Inc. (AAPL.O) has also fallen victim to China's strict COVID policy as Foxconn accounts for 70% of iPhone shipments globally, with the California-based vendor this week lowering its forecast for shipments of the premium iPhone 14 models. read more

Spot lockdowns and disruptions to business have highlighted the risks companies face in China, with global firms including Canada Goose Holdings Inc (GOOS.TO), and Estee Lauder Companies Inc (EL.N) shutting local stores and cutting forecasts.

In some cases, just a handful of cases has triggered city-wide lockdowns, which have taken a heavy toll on business activity and consumer confidence. read more

Reuters last month reported that Foxconn's production of Apple's iPhones at the Zhengzhou factory could slump by as much as 30% in November due to tight COVID-19 restrictions. read more

560,668,APPLE,2022-11-11,Major ad firm Omnicom recommends clients pause Twitter ad spend - memo,"













Nov 11 (Reuters) - Advertising and marketing conglomerate Omnicom Group Inc (OMC.N) has recommended that clients pause their spending on Twitter in the short term, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.

Omnicom serves over 5,000 clients in 70 countries, including McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) and Apple (AAPL.O). The memo did not mention clients by name and it is not clear if any have paused Twitter advertising spending.

The move, first reported by tech news site The Verge, emphasizes a growing skepticism among agencies and brands about the micro-blogging site's future since Elon Musk’s $44 billion takeover.

The Tesla CEO has blamed civil rights groups lobbying Twitter advertisers to boycott the service until Musk clarified how he would control misinformation and hate speech on the service for a “massive” revenue drop.

“Twitter’s ability to maintain their previous level of brand safety measures and effectiveness seem impeded in the immediate term,” according to the memo.

“Whilst OMG believes this is unlikely to result in a significantly higher risk environment for advertisers, the risk of being associated with unsafe content could rise and as such should be considered when deciding on use of the platform.”

Ad sales represented over 90% of Twitter's revenue in the second quarter.

Last month, U.S. automaker General Motors Co (GM.N) said it had temporarily halted paid advertising on Twitter. read more

561,217,APPLE,2022-11-11,Exclusive: Apple supplier Foxconn plans to quadruple workforce at India plant,"













NEW DELHI/TAIPEI, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) supplier Foxconn (2317.TW) plans to quadruple the workforce at its iPhone factory in India over two years, two government officials with knowledge of the matter said, pointing to a production adjustment as it faces disruptions in China.

Foxconn has grabbed headlines in recent weeks, with tight virus restrictions at its Zhengzhou plant, the world's largest iPhone factory, disturbing production and fuelling concerns over the impact of China's virus policy on global supply chains.

The disruptions prompted Apple to lower its forecast for shipments of the premium iPhone 14 models this week, dampening its sales outlook for the busy year-end holiday season.

Taiwan-based Foxconn now plans to boost the workforce at its plant in southern India to 70,000 by adding 53,000 more workers over the next two years, said the sources, who declined to be named as the discussions are private.

While the size of the plant in India's southern state of Tamil Nadu is dwarfed by Foxconn's Zhengzhou plant, which employs 200,000 workers, it is central to Apple's efforts to shift production away from China.

Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, opened the India plant in 2019 and has been ramping up production. It began producing iPhone 14 this year.

Foxconn's interest in expanding the facility is known, but the scale of the planned expansion and timelines have previously not been reported.

Both Foxconn and Apple declined to comment.

Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way said on an earnings call on Thursday the company would adjust its production capacity and output so there was no impact from further potential disruptions on supplies for the Christmas and Lunar New Year holidays.

Foxconn has shared its plans with Tamil Nadu officials about accelerating its hiring efforts at the Indian plant due to disruptions in China, said the first government source.

Beyond iPhones, the plant also manufactures products for other global tech firms, but the new hiring push is mainly driven by its need to meet growing iPhone demand, the person added.

A person in Taiwan with knowledge of the matter said Foxconn was expanding its operations in India to increase its capacity for basic models and to meet Indian demand.

""We are gradually increasing our production scale there,"" the person said, declining to give details on its hiring plans in India.

The second government source in India, a senior official in the Tamil Nadu administration, said the state government was working with Foxconn in ""finalising"" the expansion.

On Oct. 27, the state's investment promotion arm tweeted that top government officials had travelled to Taiwan and met Liu. They had ""elaborately discussed Foxconn's plans for new ventures and investments"" and offered the government's support.

The state was having discussions with the suppliers to address issues such as housing facilities for workers as it looked to expand, the first government official said.

Last year, Foxconn's Tamil Nadu plant was at the centre of a mass food-poisoning incident which sparked employee protests and threw light on the living conditions of the workers in hostels near the factory.

Officials at Tamil Nadu, a hub of electronic and automotive manufacturing, were also pushing Apple suppliers to branch out into manufacturing components for iPhones beyond just assembly, the two government sources added.

Currently, iPhones are assembled in India by at least three of Apple's global suppliers: Foxconn and Pegatron (4938.TW) in Tamil Nadu; and Wistron (3231.TW) in nearby Karnataka state.

JP Morgan analysts estimated in September that Apple may make one out of four iPhones in India by 2025, and 25% of all Apple products, including Mac, iPad, Apple Watch and AirPods, will be manufactured outside China by 2025 from 5% currently.

562,201,APPLE,2022-11-14,Epic's 'failure of proof' in Apple antitrust case questioned by appeals panel,"













SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 14 (Reuters) - ""Fortnite"" video game maker Epic Games on Monday asked a three-judge federal appeals panel to overturn portions of a lower court antitrust ruling that largely favored Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and its multibillion dollar App Store payment business.

Attorneys involved expect up to nine months before a ruling from the panel, which signaled some doubts about Epic's appeal but noted they would have to wade through contradictions within the lower court's reasoning.

Epic had sued Apple in 2020 alleging that the iPhone maker unlawfully requires software developers to pay it commissions of up to 30% on in-app purchases by consumers.

After a three-week trial last year, a judge stopped short of dubbing Apple an ""illegal monopolist"" and found that Epic had failed to prove that the privacy and security benefits of the commissions and related policies outweighed costs to consumers.

On Monday, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel quizzed attorneys from Epic, Apple and the U.S. Justice Department about whether the trial judge properly compared those consequences.

Epic acknowledged it had not brought sufficient evidence on some points. Apple reiterated that the commissions help it fund review of apps to ensure consumers are not exposed to fraudulent, pornographic or privacy-intrusive apps.

Judge Milan Smith told Epic’s attorney Tom Goldstein near the end of the 1-hour, 15-minute hearing, “The one thing that really troubles me is this failure of proof. Looking at the record, it seems (Apple’s attorneys) have made a good case.""

Smith and Goldstein then agreed that the lower court ruling ultimately delivered mixed messages on whether Apple's ""walled garden"" approach to managing the App Store was legally justified, which the Ninth Circuit must now sort.

""It’s hard to make it square,"" Smith said.

Key to the ruling was the lower court finding that Apple's contracts with developers did not violate antitrust laws because they were non-negotiable - developers either agreed or could not use the App Store. Epic argues that such standard agreements are still subject to scrutiny.

Other large technology companies deploy similar agreements, and the Justice Department joined the hearing because it said the lower court ruling could ""significantly harm antitrust enforcement beyond the specific context of this case.""

The appeals panel also is reviewing the lower court's order that Apple let developers tell users how to make app purchases outside of its proprietary payment system.

563,778,APPLE,2022-11-14,FDA 2.0: Initial upgrade complete — federal legislative action is necessary to regulate Dr. Robot,"Law firms Kaufman Dolowich & Voluck, LLP Follow















November 14, 2022 - Technology and science have the potential to fundamentally transform the health care industry. As artificial intelligence and machine learning advance, medical devices will detect disease earlier, diagnose more accurately, target better therapies and improve personalized medicine. However, the current regulatory framework implemented by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is not well suited to the adoption of digital health products.

In July 2017, the FDA launched the Software Precertification Pilot Program (Pre-Cert Program) to replace the current FDA product-by-product premarket review process and ""fast-track"" the process for medical device developers that the FDA trusts to produce consistently high-quality, safe and secure products, thereby removing the necessity to undergo the full review process.

After five years of collecting data from nine volunteer companies considered to be the leading developers of digital health products, the FDA issued a final report — ""The Software Precertification (Pre-Cert) Pilot Program: Tailored Total Product Lifecycle Approaches and Key Findings,"" Sept. 26, 2022 — discussing the results of its revolutionary Pre-Cert Program, which concluded that rapidly evolving medical device software technologies could benefit from an updated regulatory framework. Most importantly, however, the recent report notes that the FDA lacks the legal authority to fully implement the program.

FDA oversight and digital health

For decades, the FDA has been charged with the responsibility of regulating medical devices, and its incorporated software, to ensure safety for its consumers. There are two different ways that such software is categorized: (1) a 'software in a medical device' (SIMD); or (2) a 'software as a medical device' (SaMD).

SIMD incorporates software into a traditional medical device to aid functionality, such as a robotic surgical device that implements software for a surgeon to control navigation features while conducting surgery. On the other hand, when the software itself is the medical device, it is classified as a SaMD. For example, a software program that analyzes X-rays and engages in computer-assisted diagnosis is considered an SaMD.

Over the last decade, SaMDs have exploded in both demand and popularity resulting in a new category of health care products coined as ""digital health"" encompassing the development of wearables such as Apple Watches and Fitbits to mobile health care applications aimed at assisting physicians and patients. However, a widely recognized challenge to the growth and advancement of digital health is the FDA's premarket review requirements as it is a lengthy and expensive process. The current FDA premarket review process requires developers of SaMDs to understand the FDA requirements, gather necessary data, prepare voluminous submissions and answer the FDA's stringent criteria.

As such, the FDA's outdated premarket review process severely hampers the speed at which the medical device industry can innovate — a necessary trade-off to ensure that medical devices are marketed to the consumer with a great degree of assured safety and effectiveness. The digital health medical device industry simply cannot thrive within the traditional regulatory structure, a challenge that has previously been addressed by Congress in 2016.

The 21st Century Cures Act

In 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (the Cures Act) was enacted by Congress clarifying, among other various purposes, the FDA's regulatory oversight over digital health and medical devices. Pursuant to the Act, digital health — under the purview of the FDA and subject to regulatory authority — includes machines or devices that use artificial intelligence such as machine learning to provide diagnostic information to patients.

Most importantly, the Cures Act provides that devices classified as low-risk medical software that serve as electronic patient records or data storage are to be excluded from the lengthy premarket review process. To put it simply, if the AI algorithm does not provide a diagnosis or predict a course of treatment, the FDA does not need to regulate it.

Before Apple Watches, Fitbits and other mobile medical devices were utilized to track steps or monitor hearts, a medical device was traditionally only thought of and used to provide measurements or give treatments. Considering the increasing popularity and demand of SaMD, and the imperfect fit between technology development and federal regulation, the FDA pitched a pilot program to pre-certify eligible health developers who could market their devices to consumers without additional FDA review.

An overview of the pre-cert pilot program

The FDA launched the Pilot Program as an initial step forward in developing a new regulatory framework that accommodates the distinctive nature of Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) and replaces the FDA's current product-by-product premarket review process with a ""pre-certify"" process for SaMD developers who demonstrate sufficient quality performance. In other words, SaMD developers would be able to forgo the current FDA premarket review process.

Pilot program results and future legislation

Under the Pre-Cert program, the FDA provided nine companies, including Apple, Samsung, Verily, Johnson & Johnson, Roche and Fitbit, with the voluntary opportunity to partake in a ""pre-certification"" process and forgo the FDA's stringent premarket review by demonstrating in-house adherence to objective criteria related to software design, development, testing and validation.

During the Pilot Program, the FDA conducted ongoing ""Excellence Appraisals"" of the nine participants and evaluated each company's ability to develop safe and effective devices, instead of monitoring the medical device itself as currently required under the FDA's 510(k) process. The FDA also collected data throughout the Pilot Program concerning the volunteer companies' capacity to monitor and improve a SaMD during its life cycle.

The FDA report states that the current medical device regulatory approach is far too rigid and impractical to efficiently evaluate the safety and effectiveness of modern medical technology and digital health devices.

The Pilot Program resulted in various findings related to excellence principles and key performance indicators (KPI) that may be useful to SaMD manufactures.

Some of the KPI objectives identified by the Pilot Program and considered as the best practices for implementation of a quality management system in compliance with the Quality System Regulation (21 C.F.R. Part 820) are:

(1) development of well-characterized software, i.e., ""the software behaves as expected"";

(2) deployment and monitoring of such software, i.e., ""the software behaves as expected in the real-world"";

(3) a patching process that ensures timely resolution of issues, i.e., ""software can be fixed when it does not behave as expected;"" and

(4) a process to ensure modifications meet user needs through real-world use.

Ultimately, innovation aside, the FDA concluded that under current statutory authorities there are significant challenges to implement the Pilot Program. However, the report offers no guidance or detail about what type of regulatory framework would be useful to achieve the goals of the Pilot Program. Instead, the FDA provides that the rate at which digital health develops requires that a flexible and risk-based approach to regulation of medical devices be considered.

While the FDA's regulatory process regarding these innovative technologies still requires a great deal of fine-tuning, it is encouraging to see the hurdles have been recognized. Hopefully in time, the legislative action necessary to allow for the FDA to move at — or close to — the speed of these developing technologies will be executed.

564,501,APPLE,2022-11-14,Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway discloses $4.1 billion TSMC stake,"













Nov 14 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) said it bought more than $4.1 billion of stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (2330.TW), , a rare significant foray into the technology sector by billionaire Warren Buffett's conglomerate.

The news sent shares in TSMC soaring, closing up 7.9% in Taiwan on Tuesday, as it boosted investor sentiment for the world's largest contract chipmaker, which saw its shares hit a two-year low last month due to a sharp slowdown in global chip demand.

In a Monday regulatory filing describing its U.S.-listed equity investments as of Sept. 30, Berkshire said it owned about 60.1 million American depositary shares of TSMC.

TSMC's other foreign investors include U.S. asset managers BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and Vanguard Group Inc, and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC (GIC.UL).

Berkshire also disclosed new stakes of $297 million in building materials company Louisiana-Pacific Corp (LPX.N) and $13 million in Jefferies Financial Group Inc (JEF.N). It exited an investment in Store Capital Corp (STOR.N), a real estate company that agreed in September to be taken private.

The filing did not specify whether Buffett or his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler made specific purchases and sales. Investors often try to piggy back on what Berkshire buys. Larger investments are normally Buffett's.

While Berkshire does not normally make big technology bets, it often prefers companies it perceives to have competitive advantages, often through their size.

TSMC, which makes chips for the likes of Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Qulacomm (QCOM.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), posted an 80% jump in quarterly profit last month, but struck a more cautious note than usual on upcoming demand.

The logo of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) is pictured at its headquarters, in Hsinchu, Taiwan, January 19, 2021. REUTERS/Ann Wang

""I suspect Berkshire has a belief that the world cannot do without the products manufactured by Taiwan Semi,"" said Tom Russo, a partner at Gardner, Russo & Quinn in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, which owns Berkshire shares.

""Only a small number of companies that can amass the capital to deliver semiconductors, which are increasingly central to people's lives,"" he added.

Berkshire has had mixed success in technology.

Its more than six-year wager during the last decade in IBM Corp (IBM.N) did not pan out, but Berkshire is sitting on huge unrealized gains on its $126.5 billion stake in Apple, which Buffett views more as a consumer products company.

Apple is by far the largest investment in Berkshire's $306.2 billion equity portfolio.

Berkshire disclosed the TSMC stake about 2-1/2 months after it began reducing a decade-old, multi-billion dollar stake in BYD Co (002594.SZ), China's largest electric car company.

In the third quarter, Berkshire added to its stakes in Chevron Corp (CVX.N), Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N), Celanese Corp (CE.N), Paramount Global (PARA.O) and RH (RH.N).

It also sold shares of Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O), Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), General Motors Co (GM.N), Kroger Co (KR.N) and US Bancorp (USB.N).

Buffett, 92, has run Berkshire since 1965. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company also owns dozens of businesses such as the BNSF railroad, the Geico auto insurer, several energy and industrial companies, Fruit of the Loom and Dairy Queen.

565,172,APPLE,2022-11-15,Apple prepares to source chips from Arizona plant - Bloomberg News,"













Nov 15 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is preparing to begin sourcing chips for its devices from a plant under construction in Arizona in the United States, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.

The company may also expand its supply of chips from plants in Europe, the report said, attributing it to remarks by Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook at an internal meeting in Germany with local engineering and retail employees.

Apple declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.

According to the report, Cook was likely referring to an Arizona factory that will be run by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW), the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major supplier to Apple.

Last year, TSMC said it had started construction at a site in Arizona where it planned to spend $12 billion to build a computer chip factory, and planned to start volume production of chips using its 5-nanometer production technology in 2024.

Earlier this month, TSMC also said it was constructing a building that could serve as its second chip factory in Arizona. read more

566,841,APPLE,2022-11-16,Sonos CEO sees upbeat holiday season as supply snarls ease,"













Nov 16 (Reuters) - Sonos Inc (SONO.O), which has been grappling with weak demand for its high-end speakers, is counting on easing supply chain bottlenecks and a rare set of promotions to lift sales in the holiday quarter, Chief Executive Patrick Spence told Reuters.

The company beat quarterly revenue estimates on Wednesday, as it stays resilient even as the broader retail industry struggles with a consumer spending slump caused by decades-high inflation.

The trend mirrors the strength seen at other luxury goods companies such as LVMH (LVMH.PA), whose focus on higher-income consumers have shielded them from economic gyrations.

Sonos is seeing strong demand for its $349 entry-level sound bar Ray and the wireless loudspeaker Sub Mini priced at $429, Spence said.

He added that existing customers accounted for 44% of new product registrations in the year to Oct. 1, a sign that brand loyalty was helping Sonos fend off competition from bigger rivals Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Google (GOOGL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) - which offer cheaper, voice-enabled speakers.

Still, the company added only 1.4 million net new households in the period, compared with 1.8 million a year earlier.

Its growth was throttled by a shortage of chips and product components, exacerbated by strict COVID-19 lockdowns in China. Sonos also saw some softness in orders from peak pandemic levels as consumers spent more time outside.

""China is important in terms of our overall supply chain, but we are also in Malaysia and Vietnam. So, we have also recreated a more resilient supply chain,"" Spence said.

Sonos is also under pressure from a strong dollar, which is expected to shave off $79 million from sales in 2023.

""We have our fingers crossed that the holiday season will be good for us because it's one of those rare times when we do put some things on sale,"" said newly appointed finance chief Eddie Lazarus, who served in the role on an interim basis since September.

567,731,APPLE,2022-11-16,Chinese authorities call on retired soldiers to help Foxconn iPhone plant -SSN,"













SHANGHAI, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Local authorities in China's Henan province are urging retired soldiers and government workers to take on stints at Foxconn's (2317.TW) iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, the official Shanghai Securities News reported on Tuesday.

The plant, the world's largest iPhone manufacturing facility, has been hit by discontent over government mandated measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, which required the company to isolate many workers but also prompted many others to flee in recent weeks.

The calls to retired workers have come from authorities in cities such as Jiyuan and Kaifeng, who are saying that those who take up the offer will be eligible to receive their current salary plus wages and bonuses from the factory, the publication said in a piece on its official WeChat account.

In Jiyuan, for example, public sector workers can receive a bonus of 800 yuan ($112.9) after signing up for the job, and a further 3,000 yuan ($423.5) bonus after completing 30 days of work, on top of factory wages and their current salary, it said, citing an unnamed junior government official.

Foxconn declined to comment on the hiring schemes, and also declined to give further updates on the Zhengzhou plant's manufacturing status.

Apple last week lowered its forecast for shipments of the premium iPhone 14 model due to the situation. Reuters last month reported that Foxconn's production of Apple's iPhones at the Zhengzhou factory could slump by as much as 30% in November.

Earlier this month, Foxconn quadrupled bonuses for workers who stayed and also began a recruitment drive that advertised higher than usual salaries.

On Tuesday, the Henan Daily reported that the factory received its first batch of new workers on Nov. 13.

568,415,APPLE,2022-11-16,India's electronics industry moves towards uniform charging ports for smartphones,"













NEW DELHI, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Electronics industry stakeholders in India have agreed to a phased roll-out of USB-C type uniform charging ports for devices including smartphones and laptops, the Indian government said on Wednesday.

Adoption of the USB-C connectors, used by many Android based devices, is expected to hurt Apple Inc (AAPL.O) whose iPhones are charged using a Lightning cable currently.

The iPhone maker has to change the charger for its phones in the European Union from autumn 2024, in order to comply with new rules that mandate a single charging port for most electronic devices.

""A broad consensus emerged among stakeholders on adoption of USB Type-C as a charging port for electronic devices,"" the Ministry of Consumer Affairs said in a statement after a government task-force meeting with industry groups representing smartphone players.

A different charging port may be adopted for phones lacking the more advanced features of a smartphone, such as being able to use the web to download applications, the ministry said.

A group will also be formed to examine the feasibility of a uniform charging port for wearable devices like earphones and smart watches, the government said.

The statement did not name any companies that attended the meeting or agreed to the proposal of a phased roll-out. The government would conduct a study to assess the environmental impact of switching to a uniform charging port, it said.

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Law firms Related documents Koss sued Poly, Apple, Bose and others over wireless headphones

Court agrees with Poly that Koss patents are invalid















(Reuters) - HP Inc's Poly subsidiary on Wednesday defeated a patent lawsuit brought by headphone maker Koss Corp in California federal court over technology used in wireless headphones.

U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar said the Koss patents are invalid, finding the inventions they cover, related to streaming audio to headphones over a wireless network, are too abstract to be patented.

Representatives for Koss and for Poly, formerly known as Plantronics Inc, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Koss sued several makers of wireless headphones and earbuds in 2020 for infringing its patents, including Apple Inc, Bose Corp and Poly.

Milwaukee-based Koss settled its lawsuit against Apple over the tech giant's AirPod earbuds and Beats headphones shortly before a trial was set to begin in July.

Koss accused Poly's BackBeat headphones of infringing several patents covering aspects of a wireless-headphone system that Koss developed in the early 2000s. Poly asked the Oakland, California court to dismiss the case last year, arguing the patents were ""broadly directed to the abstract idea of wireless communication over a network.""

Tigar agreed with Poly on Wednesday, ruling that the patents did not contain an inventive concept that would make them patent eligible.

The judge also gave Koss permission to amend its lawsuit within 21 days.

The case is Koss Corp v. Plantronics Inc, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 4:21-cv-03854.

570,401,APPLE,2022-11-17,"Foxconn hires over 100,000 workers for COVID-hit Chinese plant - Yicai","













SHANGHAI, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) supplier Foxconn (2317.TW) has hit a hiring target of 100,000 new workers for its Zhengzhou plant in China, financial news outlet Yicai reported on Thursday, a milestone that could ease production pressure at the COVID-hit site.

Yicai, citing an unidentified high-ranking staffer at the plant, said Foxconn had received more than 100,000 job applications so far and was ending its latest hiring drive.

Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The plant, the world's largest iPhone manufacturing facility, has since last month faced staff discontent over government mandated measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, which required the company to isolate many employees and prompted some to flee.

Apple last week lowered its forecast for shipments of the premium iPhone 14 model due to the situation. Reuters last month reported that Foxconn's production of iPhones at the Zhengzhou factory could slump by as much as 30% in November.

Earlier this month, Foxconn quadrupled bonuses for workers who stayed and also began a recruitment drive that advertised higher than usual salaries.

Some local authorities in Henan province urged retired soldiers and government workers to take on stints at the factory, which prior to the situation had about 200,000 workers.

571,855,APPLE,2022-11-18,Ticketmaster shares spotlight with Taylor Swift,"













NEW YORK, Nov 18 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ticketmaster has a pretty bad seat for the Taylor Swift show. The company owned by $17 billion Live Nation Entertainment (LYV.N) canceled plans to hawk general admission to the pop star’s “Eras” tour – her first in five years – after a surge in pre-sale demand crashed its systems. The mess has attracted an audience of lawmakers booing Live Nation’s market power. It also risks tempting Swift to turn the spotlight on Ticketmaster.

In 2010, U.S. trustbusters allowed Ticketmaster to merge with Live Nation and create one of the largest event businesses in the world. It attached certain conditions banning the company from pushing venues around, but the Department of Justice said in 2019 that Live Nation broke its promises. Legislators including Minnesota Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar are pushing for an encore review of the deal.

Pearl Jam and Bruce Springsteen tried unsuccessfully to weaken Ticketmaster, but Swift might be able to move the needle. She pulled her catalog off Spotify arguing that streaming crushed the industry’s economics and took on Apple (AAPL.O), prompting it to pay artists royalties during free trials for its music streaming service. Taylor Swift and Uncle Sam would be a formidable duo. (By Jennifer Saba)

Summary Companies For poll data click:

Orders median forecast -1% y/y (prior month -3.1%)

Data due Monday, Nov 21, 4:00 p.m. (0800 GMT)















TAIPEI, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Taiwan's export orders likely contracted again in October as global demand for technology cools though at a slower rate than the previous month, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.

The median forecast from a poll of 13 economists was for export orders to fall 1% from a year earlier. Forecasts ranged from an expansion of 1.9% to a contraction of 5.4%.

The island's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, fell 3.1% in September, coming off a high base and supported by strong sales of new consumer electronics products like iPhones.

The government has predicted last month's export orders to be between 1% and 3.6% lower than those of October 2021.

Taiwan's export orders are a leading indicator of demand for hi-tech gadgets and Asian exports, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months.

The island's manufacturers, including the world's largest contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW), , are a key part of the global supply chain for technology giants including Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

The data for October will be released on Monday.

574,889,APPLE,2022-11-21,Disney's Iger may have to cut costs as streaming loses money,"













Nov 21 (Reuters) - Saving Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) this time will require Bob Iger to show off a different side to his character.

The legendary chief executive who transformed Disney into the most powerful entertainment company on the planet will need to show how quickly he can cut costs and restore profitability, analysts say.

Disney shocked investors late on Sunday evening by announcing the ouster of CEO Bob Chapek and appointing Iger, 71, to a two-year contract to return the company to growth. read more

The move evoked other return engagements such as Steve Jobs' return to Apple and Howard Schultz's return to Starbucks in times of crisis.

""The bold move (Iger's return) might feel like the right one. However, the business is at a different phase of growth,"" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore said, adding that short-term measures might include restriction of some operations.

The most immediate target of that could be Disney+, the streaming service that Iger helped launch in 2019. Losses at the unit more than doubled in the last reported quarter to $1.5 billion.

The business has become a drag on earnings as Disney spends heavily on content to attract subscribers, testing investor patience and contributing to a 40% slide in its shares so far this year.

""Disney+ ... could probably do better with fewer end-state subscribers made up of super fans willing to pay high RPU (rates per user), which would generate much higher margins,"" analysts at MoffettNathanson said.

They also pointed to ESPN as another target for deep cost cuts, including a review of all the upcoming sports rights as the network loses cable subscribers.

Activist investor Dan Loeb's Third Point had also pushed a potential spin-off of ESPN when it took a stake in the company in August, although it later backed off the idea.

Some brokerages have also raised concern on whether the two-year period Iger has agreed to return for would be enough to transform the business and find a successor.

""The problem is that Iger can't stay on forever. He already bumbled the transition to Tom Staggs in 2016 and now (Bob) Chapek,"" Rosenblatt Securities said.

Still, Disney shares were up 7.5% on Monday, a sign of confidence in the executive who led the company for 15 years.

Summary Companies Oct export orders -6.3% y/y vs -1% poll forecast

Export orders from China -26.7% y/y vs -27.9% in Sept

Ministry sees Nov orders between -14.5% and -17.6% y/y

Outlook difficult, not helped by China's zero-COVID policy















TAIPEI, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Taiwan's export orders contracted more severely than expected in October on weak consumer demand hit by inflation and interest rate hikes, with the government warning that China's insistence on a zero-COVID strategy would affect the outlook.

Export orders, a bellwether for global technology demand, shrank 6.3% in October from a year earlier to $55.4 billion, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said on Monday. Analysts had expected a drop of 1%.

Reuters Graphics

October's fall - the steepest since January 2020, when it dropped 12.8% - followed September's annual contraction of 3.1%.

Orders for telecoms products slipped 0.3% in October from a year ago because of weaker consumer demand, but also coming off a high base, the ministry said.

However, orders for electronic products rose 9.6%, driven by demand for high-end computing, automobiles and stockpiling ahead of the end of the year, it added.

There were also many clouds ahead, despite ""growth momentum"" from automotive electronics and data centres ahead of the year-end holiday season in Western markets and January's Lunar New Year holiday in East Asia, it added.

""Global inflation and interest rate pressures continue to be high; the war between Russia and Ukraine, and mainland China's insistence on the zero-COVID policy, will add uncertainty to the economic outlook, which may affect performance of export orders,"" it said.

The ministry added that it expected export orders this month to be lower by 14.5% to 17.6% than in November 2021.

Taiwan firms, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW), , are major suppliers to Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and other global tech companies.

Taiwan's October orders from China plummeted 26.7% from a year earlier, versus September's annual fall of 27.9%. Month-on-month orders from China dropped 9%.

China has stuck to its stringent zero-COVID approach, even as other nations have eased curbs. That has led to widespread public frustration and damage inflicted on the world's second-largest economy with lockdowns, some in key industrial areas.

Taiwan's orders from the United States edged up 1.2% from a year earlier, slower than the rise of 2.8% the previous month.

Export orders from Europe rose 4.3%, versus September's annual rise of 9.6%. Orders from Japan expanded 8.5%.

576,736,APPLE,2022-11-21,Carl Icahn holds short position in GameStop - Bloomberg News,"













Nov 21 (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn has a sizeable short position in video game retailer GameStop Corp (GME.N), Bloomberg News reported on Monday, citing sources familiar with the matter.

GameStop, which is among the so-called ""meme stocks"", was popular among retail investors during the pandemic in what came to be known as the ""short squeeze"".

Short-sellers borrow shares and sell them, seeking to profit by returning them after buying the stock back at a lower price.

Icahn began shorting the stock around January 2021, the report added but did not provide details of the size of Icahn's position.

The stock, which has lost nearly a third of its value so far this year, fell about 9% on Monday.

Short interest in GameStop's stock is very high, with 17.53% of the company's outstanding shares shorted as of Oct. 31, according to Refinitiv data. In comparison, short interests in Apple Inc (AAPL.O), the world's largest public company, and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), the world's most valuable auto maker, are 0.65% and is 2.43%, respectively, according to Refinitiv data.

In September, GameStop announced a partnership with Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX US to increase its presence in the cryptocurrency space even as analysts said the partnership was ""unlikely to yield meaningful revenue or profit"".

Earlier this month, FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. in the biggest crypto industry blow up till date.

The retailer executed a four-for-one stock split this year, the stock rose a split-adjusted high of over $120 in Jan. 2021.

Icahn Enterprises did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

577,138,APPLE,2022-11-21,"SUV crashes into Boston-area Apple store, killing a man","













Nov 21 (Reuters) - A sports utility vehicle crashed through the front window of an Apple retail store near Boston on Monday before coming to rest at the rear of the showroom, leaving at least one person dead and 16 hospitalized, authorities and local media said.

The black SUV was traveling at an undetermined speed when it plowed into the store in Hingham, Massachusetts, and struck ""multiple people,"" Plymouth District Attorney Timothy Cruz said at a press conference.

Sixteen people were sent to hospitals with ""traumatic injuries,"" he said, and a criminal investigation was underway.

The male driver is currently with police officers, Cruz said. Authorities have not released his name, said if he was injured, or given any more detail as to the cause of the incident.

After crashing through the window within an hour of the store's opening, the 2019 Toyota 4Runner came to rest at the back of the outlet and the driver was extricated from the wreckage, Boston's WCVB-TV reported.

""You'd have to really be picking up speed to end up in the storage area at the back side of the Apple store,"" Frank O'Brien, who was visiting the shopping center, told The Patriot Ledger newspaper.

Aerial footage of the scene showed the shattered window of the store, located in an outdoor mall about 15 miles (24 km)south of downtown Boston. Emergency personnel could be seen tending to injured people on the sidewalk.

The victim who died at the scene was identified as Kevin Bradley, 65, of New Jersey, Cruz said in a news release.

Apple, which said the company was ""devastated"" by the incident, described Bradley in a statement as ""a professional who was onsite supporting recent construction"" at the location.

578,355,APPLE,2022-11-22,Six former staff of Hong Kong newspaper plead guilty to conspiracy to collude,"













HONG KONG, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Six former members of staff at Hong Kong's defunct pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily pleaded guilty on Tuesday to conspiracy to commit collusion with foreign forces in a closely watched national security case.

The six pleaded guilty to conspiring with media tycoon Jimmy Lai and other people to request a foreign country or organisation “to impose sanctions or blockade, or engage in other hostile activities” against the Hong Kong and Chinese governments between July 2020 and June 2021.

The six include Cheung Kim-hung, who was chief executive of the newspaper's former owner, Next Digital, Apple Daily's former associate publisher Chan Pui-man, former editor-in-chief Ryan Law, former executive editor-in-chief Lam Man-chung, former English edition editor-in-chief Fung Wai-kong and former editorial writer Yeung Ching-kee.

Prosecutor Anthony Chau said Apple Daily was used as a platform to advocate for foreign sanctions.

""The impugned content took the form of, among others, articles purported to be news coverage of current issues, commentary articles, and appeals or propaganda directly and unlawfully advocating political agenda,"" Chau said.

Chau also cited content published by the Apple Daily as far back as March 2019, which he said included seditious statements and appeals to the public to take part in pro-democracy protests that year.

The 2019 protests were the biggest since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 and were fueled by criticism from democracy campaigners who said Beijing had reneged on a commitment to maintain Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedoms under a “one country, two systems” formula.

Beijing and Hong Kong's government denied that and accused the protesters of undermining the stability at the heart of Hong Kong's economic success, at the behest of foreigners.

Beijing imposed a security law in 2020 setting out punishment of up to life in prison for acts that China considers as subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.

Lai and the six former Apple Daily staff members were charged with conspiracy to commit collusion with foreign forces under the law.

A fierce critic of Beijing, Lai, who is already in jail after being convicted for his role in an illegal assembly in 2020, faces multiple charges under the national security law.

Lai and his three companies have pleaded not guilty to the national security and sedition charges.

Some of the six will give evidence in Lai's trial, Chau said. Their sentences will be handed down at the end that trial, which will begin on Dec. 1 and is expected to last 30 days.

579,319,APPLE,2022-11-22,IPhone Pro models scarce in stores this holiday - Best Buy,"













Nov 22 (Reuters) - High-end iPhones will be in short supply at stores this holiday season, Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) said on Tuesday, following a warning from Apple Inc (AAPL.O) this month that China's zero-COVID policy was squeezing production at a key factory.

The supply issues are expected to significantly hurt the premium iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max models, which start at nearly $1,000.

""One of the places where we're seeing a bit of (inventory) pressure is in those higher-end iconic iPhone devices,"" Best Buy boss Corie Barry said on a media call.

Analysts have flagged that inventory of iPhones at Apple stores around the Black Friday shopping season were down from a year earlier, and it was taking longer to replenish stocks.

IPhones draw customers to Best Buy stores, especially during the holiday season, and often trigger impulse buying, and Apple fans waiting for the latest devices could push out sales into the next quarter.

A Best Buy store in Bronx, New York, that Reuters visited did not have any iPhone Pro models available. A store supervisor, Michael Phillips, said it takes at least two weeks for models to reach after orders are placed.

""We lose a lot of customers because of that,"" Phillips said. For people who want the Pro Max, ""you're not going to settle for something that doesn't have the specs you want.""

Best Buy did not respond to a request for comment on this.

Demand for high-end smartphones has helped Apple emerge relatively unscathed even as consumers cut spending amid surging inflation and interest rates.

""Across consumers, we can also see that savings are being drawn down and credit usage is going up,"" Barry said. ""Value clearly matters to everyone.""

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives estimates 8 million iPhone 14 units will be sold over the Black Friday weekend, about 2 million fewer than iPhone 13s a year ago, as many Apple stores have 25% fewer iPhones in their inventories than a year earlier.

""IPhone sales may get pushed to the March quarter and out of the December period,"" Thomas Forte, analyst at D.A. Davidson said.

Earlier this month, Apple warned of delays in shipments of its flagship product following a significant production cut at Foxconn's (2317.TW) Zhengzhou plant due to China's strict COVID-19 policy.

Apple did not respond to a request for comment on this story.

Best Buy's Barry said the company had factored the expected loss in sales due to the shortage of the premium iPhones into its holiday quarter forecast.

Still, Best Buy on Tuesday forecast a smaller drop in annual sales than it had previously estimated.

580,231,APPLE,2022-11-22,Apple supplier Foxconn hires chip veteran formerly at TSMC and SMIC,"













TAIPEI, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Major Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier and iPhone assembler Foxconn (2317.TW) said on Tuesday it had hired Chiang Shang-yi, a former top executive at Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC (2330.TW) and Chinese chipmaker SMIC, to lead its growing push in the chip business.

Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker, is best known for assembling iPhones and other Apple products, though in recent years it has been expanding into chips to diversify its business.

It bought a chip plant from Taiwan chipmaker Macronix International (2337.TW) last year and in September announced a joint venture with India's Vedanta Ltd (VDAN.NS) to set up semiconductor and display production plants there.

Foxconn said in a statement that Chiang had been appointed its semiconductor strategy officer, a newly created role.

The company said his deep experience in the industry would provide ""invaluable support"" and technical guidance for the group's global semiconductor deployment strategy.

""We are grateful to have such a seasoned semiconductor veteran join us at this important juncture in the group's development,"" Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way added in the statement.

Chiang previously worked as vice president of research and development at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker.

He was more recently the vice chairman of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (0981.HK) (SMIC), the largest and most advanced chipmaker in China.

Chiang resigned from his position at SMIC last November, roughly a year after joining the company for the second time.

His move to China was controversial given Taiwan's concern about losing chip talent to its giant neighbour, which has struggled to recreate the island's success at making semiconductors.

581,881,APPLE,2022-11-22,'Boomerang CEOs' don't always work out; Disney hopes this one bucks trend,"













NEW YORK, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Can Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) bank on another hit sequel?

That appears to be the hope behind the company's surprise decision to bring back former chief executive Bob Iger to replace Bob Chapek. The decision was largely cheered by Wall Street, with Disney's stock gaining more than 6% on Monday to cut its loss to 37% for the year to date.

The move is effective immediately.

During his first tenure from 2005 to 2020, Disney's annualised shareholder returns were more than 14%, well above its rival Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and the broader stock market, and in total in that period the stock rose more than 400%.

Yet analysts and some investors say that a returning CEO repeating their past success is not a given, and the decision to once again hand them the reins may be a sign that a company's culture is sputtering.

""From a governance perspective it's a big red flag,"" said Brian Frank, whose Frank Funds has owned Disney on and off in the past and currently does not have a position in the company, viewing its valuation as too high. ""This is one of the highest- quality companies in the world with the best brands in the world but it shows to me that they're bad at succession planning.""

Disney did not return a request for comment for this story.

GAME-CHANGER OR DUD?

Overall, the stock performance of companies led by CEOs who returned for another stint in their former position - so-called boomerang CEOs - was 10.1% lower during their tenures than companies led by chief executives who had not had the job before, according to a 2020 study published in the MIT Sloan Management Review by Christopher Bingham, Bradley Hendricks, Travis Howell, and Kalin Kolev.

Chief among the factors for the poor performance of repeat CEOs were if the executive was a company founder, if they worked in a dynamic or fast-changing industry, and if the company had neglected succession planning, the study found.

Shares of Xerox fell 60% in the year after Paul Allaire returned as CEO in 2000 as the company was unable to adapt to new digital technologies, the study found. Shares of Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), meanwhile, rose about 3% during A.G. Lafley's two-year second stint as CEO, while the broad S&P 500 index rose about 26% over the same time.

Xerox declined comment and P&G did not respond to a request for comment.

Yet there are reasons to think that Disney may have made the right decision in bringing back Iger, Bingham said.

""There might be more reason for optimism relative to some of these other boomerang CEOs as Iger was not the founder, was not gone for too long, and is coming back in with a plan to help succession,"" he said in an email to Reuters.

Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) Steve Jobs is perhaps the best-case scenario of a chief executive returning to their previous company. Jobs famously resumed his position as CEO in 1997 when Apple was near collapse and remade it into the world's most valued company by the time he stepped down again in 2011.

Howard Schultz, who built the Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) franchise, was also successful in his second stint. Shares rose more than 1,000% in his tenure between 2008 and 2017.

Starbucks did not comment on this story, but directed Reuters to its earnings results that topped expectations after Schultz’s third term as CEO.

“I think this is a game-changer,"" said Stephanie Link, chief investment strategist and portfolio manager at Hightower Advisors, about Disney. Link has owned the stock in the past and is bullish on the name. ""This reminds me very much of Starbucks 2.0 or 3.0 with Howard Schultz returning to Starbucks,” Link said. “I think the only thing [Iger] is not great at is finding a successor.”

While Wall Street is cheering Iger's return, Disney's long-term success will rest on whether he can successfully turn the company's streaming business profitable while managing the decline of its traditional television business and a likely slowdown in its parks division if the economy falls into a recession, said David Heger, an analyst at Edward Jones.

""Iger may have dodged a bullet because the time period when Chapek was CEO was not ideal with the pandemic shutdown of the parks and the shutdown of movie production,"" Heger said. ""But it's not an enviable position to come back in to because there are so many different challenges across the business and industry.""

Summary Companies Probe follows consultation

To examine whether new rules are needed to boost competition

Google says it builds open platforms that benefit users

Apple says its promotes competition and choice















LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Britain's competition watchdog on Tuesday launched an in-depth investigation into the dominance of the mobile browsers of Apple (AAPL.O) and Google (GOOGL.O).

Responses to a consultation it launched in June revealed ""substantial support"" for a fuller investigation into the matter and into whether iPhone-maker Apple restricts cloud gaming through its app store, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said.

""Many UK businesses and web developers tell us they feel that they are being held back by restrictions set by Apple and Google,"" Sarah Cardell, interim chief executive of the CMA, said in a statement.

""We plan to investigate whether the concerns we have heard are justified and, if so, identify steps to improve competition and innovation in these sectors.""

Google said its Android mobile operating system gave users a greater choice of apps and app stores than any other mobile platform.

""It also enables developers to choose the browser engine they want, and has been the launchpad for millions of apps,"" a spokesperson said.

""We're committed to building thriving, open platforms that empower consumers and help developers build successful businesses.""

Apple said it would ""constructively"" engage with the CMA to explain how its approach ""promotes competition and choice, while ensuring consumers' privacy and security are protected.""

U.S. tech giants, including Google's owner Alphabet and Apple, are drawing increasing attention from competition regulators in Brussels, London and elsewhere.

Google's Play Store is the subject of separate investigations by anti-trust authorities in the EU and Britain, the company said last month. read more

583,509,APPLE,2022-11-23,Unrest and production disruptions at Foxconn's main iPhone plant in China,"













Nov 23 (Reuters) - Hundreds of workers on Wednesday joined protests at Foxconn's (2317.TW) flagship iPhone plant in China, in the latest upheaval related to strict COVID-19 controls.

Here is a timeline of problems at the world's biggest iPhone plant, located in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou.

OCT. 13

Amid rising COVID-19 cases in Zhengzhou, Foxconn puts the plant's 200,000 workers under closed-loop management - a system where staff live and work on-site isolated from the wider world.

OCT. 21

Foxconn tightens COVID-19 restrictions at the plant but says production remains normal.

OCT. 30

Migrant workers have begun to flee the plant's campus and return to their hometowns. Cities in central China hastily draw up plans to isolate them, fearing they could trigger COVID outbreaks.

OCT. 31

Production of Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhones could slump by as much as 30% at the plant in November due to the tighter COVID curbs, a person with direct knowledge of the matter tells Reuters.

NOV. 1

Foxconn says it has quadrupled bonuses on offer for workers at the plant as it seeks to quell discontent over the COVID curbs and retain staff.

NOV. 2

China orders the industrial park in Zhengzhou that houses the Foxconn factory to enter a seven-day lockdown.

NOV. 7

Apple says its expects lower shipments of premium iPhone 14 models than previously anticipated following a significant production cut at the Zhengzhou plant, dampening its sales outlook for the busy year-end holiday season.

NOV. 9

The Zhengzhou plant continues to isolate its operations and staff despite the lift of a seven-day lockdown for the rest of the industrial park in which it is located.

NOV. 10

Foxconn says it expects smartphone revenue to fall in the fourth quarter and is adjusting production to prevent recent COVID curbs in Zhengzhou from impacting holiday orders.

NOV. 23

Footage on social media of the protests show men wielding sticks smash surveillance cameras and windows. The trigger for the protests appears to have been a plan to delay bonus payments, many of the demonstrators said on livestream feeds. Reuters was not able to immediately verify the videos.

Summary Companies Online images show hundreds of workers protesting

Surveillance cameras and windows smashed by men with sticks

Workers complain of delayed pay, insufficient food

Foxconn says working to prevent repeat of violence















SHANGHAI/TAIPEI, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Hundreds of workers joined protests at Foxconn's (2317.TW) flagship iPhone plant in China, with some men smashing surveillance cameras and windows, footage uploaded on social media showed.

The rare scenes of open dissent in China mark an escalation of unrest at the massive factory in Zhengzhou city that has come to symbolise a dangerous build-up in frustration with the country's ultra-severe COVID rules as well as inept handling of the situation by the world's largest contract manufacturer.

The trigger for the protests, which began early on Wednesday, appeared to be a plan to delay bonus payments, many of the demonstrators said on livestream feeds. The videos could not be immediately verified by Reuters.

""Give us our pay!"", chanted workers surrounded by people in full hazmat suits, some carrying batons, according to footage from one video. Other footage showed tear gas being deployed and workers taking down quarantine barriers. Some workers had complained they were forced to share dormitories with colleagues who had tested positive for COVID-19.

Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said in a statement it had fulfilled its payment contracts and that reports of infected staff living on campus with new recruits were ""untrue.""

""Regarding any violence, the company will continue to communicate with employees and the government to prevent similar incidents from happening again,"" the company added.

A source familiar with the situation in Zhengzhou said production at the plant was unaffected by the worker unrest and output remained ""normal"".

Reuters earlier reported that iPhone output at factory could slump by as much as 30% in November, and that Foxconn aimed to resume full production there by the second half of the month. Apple Inc (AAPL.O) had warned it expects lower shipments of premium iPhone 14 models than previously anticipated.

While the latest unrest has added ""uncertainties"" to the target, the source said the company was still working hard to reach it, adding that ""only a portion"" of the new recruits took part in the unrest.

A second source familiar with the matter, however, said Foxconn was unlikely to hit the target, pointing to disruptions caused by the unrest, impacting particularly new recruits who were hired to bridge the gap in the workforce.

""Originally, we were trying to see if the new recruits could go online by the end of November. But with the unrest, it's certain that we can't resume normal production by the month-end.""

Foxconn accounts for 70% of iPhone shipments globally. It makes most of the phones at the Zhengzhou plant, though it has other smaller production sites in India and southern China.

Shares of Foxconn have slipped 2% since the unrest emerged in late October.

The disruptions may shift some iPhone sales into the March quarter from the key holiday quarter, D.A. Davidson analyst Thomas Forte said.

Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said he expected the shutdowns to cost Apple about $1 billion a week in lost iPhone sales. In the holiday quarter last year, Apple reported iPhone sales worth nearly $6 billion per week.

RECRUITMENT DRIVE

Discontent over strict quarantine rules, the company's inability to stamp out outbreaks and poor conditions including shortages of food had caused workers to flee the factory campus since the Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier imposed a so-called closed loop system at the world's biggest iPhone plant in late October.

Under closed-loop operations, staff live and work on site, isolated from the wider world.

Former workers estimate that thousands have fled the factory campus. Before the unrest, the Zhengzhou plant employed some 200,000 people. To retain staff and lure more workers Foxconn has had to offer bonuses and higher salaries.

Local authorities also stepped in to help, with some urging retired soldiers and government workers to take on stints, according to local media reports.

The first source said that the eagerness of local authorities to recruit workers may have played a role in causing ""miscommunication"" with the new hires on issues including allowance and accommodation.

The Zhengzhou government did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.

WORKER WOES

In the videos, workers vented about how they were never sure if they would get meals while in quarantine or over inadequate curbs to contain an outbreak.

""Foxconn never treats humans as humans,"" said one person.

Apple did not respond to requests for comment.

""It's now evident that closed-loop production in Foxconn only helps in preventing COVID from spreading to the city, but does nothing (if not make it even worse) for the workers in the factory,"" Aiden Chau of China Labour Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based advocacy group, said in an email.

As of Wednesday afternoon, most of the footage on Kuaishou, a social media platform where Reuters reviewed many of the videos, had been taken down. Kuaishou did not respond to a request for comment.

Nov 23 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) said Warren Buffett has donated more of his fortune to four family charities, without disclosing whether the billionaire chairman made a new donation to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

According to a regulatory filing, Buffett on Wednesday donated another 2.4 million of the conglomerate's Class B shares, worth about $759 million based on their closing price.

Buffett donated 1.5 million shares to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation. Named for his late first wife, the foundation funds college scholarships to students from Nebraska, according to its website.

Another 900,000 shares were split evenly among charities run by his children Howard, Susan and Peter: the Howard G. Buffett Foundation, the Sherwood Foundation and the Novo Foundation.

Buffett has since 2006 donated more than half of his Berkshire shares, worth more than $46 billion at the time of the donations.

More than three-quarters have gone to the Gates Foundation, still one of the world's largest private charitable foundations despite last year's divorce of its namesake co-founders.

Berkshire and the Gates Foundation did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Following the latest donations, Buffett still owns 15.5% of Berkshire's stock and controls 31.4% of its voting power.

Both percentages rise as the Omaha, Nebraska-based company repurchases its own shares from other investors.

Buffett is still worth $110.2 billion, ranking fifth worldwide, Forbes magazine said.

Berkshire owns dozens of businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Geico auto insurance, and stocks such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N). Buffett has run the company since 1965.

According the Buffett family foundation websites, the Howard G. Buffett Foundation works to alleviate hunger, mitigate conflicts and improve public safety around the world. The Sherwood Foundation supports nonprofit organizations in Nebraska; the Novo Foundation aims to support communities,

Summary Companies Retailers in focus as Black Friday sales start

Activision down on likely FTC lawsuit to block Microsoft deal

Apple slips, Foxconn China plant sees lower shipments

Indexes: Dow up 0.45%, S&P 500 down 0.03%, Nasdaq down 0.52%















Nov 25 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq closed lower on Friday with pressure from Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in a subdued holiday-shortened trading session for Wall Street, as investors watched Black Friday sales and COVID-19 cases in China.

Apple fell 2.0% on news of reduced iPhone shipments from a Foxconn plant in China in November as production was hit by COVID-related worker unrest.

The session focused on retailers as Black Friday sales kicked off against the backdrop of stubbornly high inflation and cooling economic growth.

Shoppers were expected to turn out in record numbers to shop for Black Friday deals, but with inclement weather, crowds outside stores were thin on the traditionally busiest shopping day of the year.

U.S. retail stocks have become a barometer of consumer confidence as inflation bites. So far this year, the S&P 500 retail index (.SPXRT) is down a little over 30%, while the S&P 500 (.SPX) has fallen 15%.

Shares of retailers Target Corp (TGT.N), Macy's Inc (M.N) and Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) were mixed, while the S&P consumer discretionary index (.SPLRCD) rose slightly.

""It's such a low volume trading day as most people are at home that I never count Friday after Thanksgiving,"" said Ed Cofrancesco, chief executive officer of International Assets Advisory, in Orlando, Florida.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 4.54 billion shares, compared with the 11.25 billion full-session average over the last 20 trading days.

Starting next week, investors will focus on retail sales, China's newest COVID outbreak and the Federal Reserve's next steps, Cofrancesco said.

Wall street's main indexes have rallied strongly from their early October lows, with the S&P 500 up more than 15% on a boost from a better-than-expected earnings season and more recently on hopes of less aggressive interest rates hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve.

Analysts now see a 71.1% chance that the Fed will increase its key benchmark rate by 50 basis points in December, with rates peaking in June 2023.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 152.97 points, or 0.45%, to 34,347.03; the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 1.14 points, or 0.03%, at 4,026.12; and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 58.96 points, or 0.52%, to 11,226.36.

All three indexes ended the Thanksgiving week with gains, led by the Dow, which rose 1.78%.

Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) plunged 4.07% on a media report that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was likely to file an antitrust lawsuit to block Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) $69 billion takeover bid for the video game publisher.

U.S. stock markets closed at 1 p.m. ET, after Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.81-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.35-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 89 new highs and 83 new lows.

REUTERS/Monicah Mwangi















NAIROBI, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Imagine having no sensation in a body part for most of your life and then being able to feel it at last.

That was the transformation being sought by about 60 Kenyan women who had undergone female genital mutilation, or FGM, during childhood and came forward for reconstructive surgery of the clitoris during a recent humanitarian operation in Nairobi.

""I basically feel like I'm incomplete,"" said one patient, a 39-year-old police officer, who requested anonymity due to the intimate subject matter.

""The things that other girls enjoy I don't. It has really put my esteem so down. So given an opportunity, I just decided to grab it so that at least I can maybe feel complete and maybe get what others are getting,"" she said.

Practiced in 30 countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, FGM involves the partial or total removal of the external, visible part of the clitoris or other injuries to female genitalia, usually inflicted during childhood.

FGM is illegal in Kenya but 21 percent of girls and women aged 15 to 49 have undergone some form of it, according to the United Nations Population Fund.

Rooted in social conventions and cultural beliefs about femininity and sexuality, FGM is profoundly harmful in the short and long term. Some girls die, all suffer lifelong consequences such as urinary and vaginal infections, sexual problems, complications giving birth, and psychological pain.

Reconstructive surgery was being offered during a week-long visit to Nairobi this month by U.S. surgeon Marci Bowers, organised by the NGO Clitoraid. Bowers had operated on hundreds of Kenyan women during two previous visits, in 2017 and 2019.

""It's life-changing, and this is a term we hear over and over again. They say they feel like they have their sense of womanhood back again,"" said Bowers, a pioneer in this field.

TASTING AN APPLE

The clitoris is about 11 centimetres in length and much of it is internal. Usually, the part that is cut in FGM is the tip. Bowers said the surgery involves bringing part of the clitoral body to the surface so that women can feel it.

""Imagine if there was a surgery to give back sight to a blind man or a sense of taste to someone who never tasted an apple before,"" she said. ""That's how big it is.""

Bowers has trained Kenyan doctors and nurses during her visits, and the University of Nairobi is setting up a programme to train medics in surgery to help FGM survivors, raising hopes that such interventions could be more available in future.

Joycelyn Mwangi, a Kenyan activist who works on community programmes aimed at preventing FGM through education, said that while surgery could help individual women, it was only a complement to wider efforts to combat the practice.

Stopping FGM required a change of behaviour ""at the cultural level, at the community level"", she said.

The patient at the Nairobi clinic said that if she had her way, no girl anywhere would endure FGM ""because it really puts the girl down"".

""I was nine years old. I didn't know about anything,"" she said, recalling the day when she was taken for the procedure in her home village. She bled for days afterwards and feared she would die.

""I was just told that I will be taken for something to make me a complete woman, which is actually ... the opposite,"" said the woman, who now lives in Nairobi.

""This really affected my life and that is why I opted to get the reconstruction surgery done.""

BETHESDA, Md./NEW YORK, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Many shoppers looking for Apple's (AAPL.O) latest high-end phones returned empty handed from its stores this Black Friday as the technology company struggles with production snafus in China.

Among them were Sally Gannon and her son Michael, who were visiting an Apple store in Bethesda, where they found no iPhone Pros in stock.

Similarly, Abisha Luitel wanted to get an iPhone 14 Pro for her 21-year old cousin. But the Apple store she visited was out. She purchased an older version, the 12, instead.

The ""iPhone shortages are accelerating and were front and center this morning on Black Friday across many retailers, Apple Stores, and online channels,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note.

""We believe many Apple Stores now have iPhone 14 Pro shortages based on model or color or storage of up to 25%-30% below normal heading into a typical December, which is not a good sign heading into holiday season for Cupertino,"" he said referring to Apple's headquarters.

Shares of Apple ended down 2.0% after its a source at its supplier Foxconn (2317.TW) told Reuters on Friday that iPhone production could be further hit due to worker unrest at the plant.

Apple did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. In a statement on Nov. 7, it said it expected lower iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max shipments than previously anticipated.

The plant, the world's largest Apple iPhone factory has been grappling with strict COVID-19 restrictions that have fueled discontent among workers and disrupted production ahead of Christmas and January's Lunar New Year holiday.

At an Apple store in a Bethesda, Maryland mall, an employee said there were almost no 14 Pro and Pro Max in stock. Another employee at a store in Raleigh, North Carolina said that iPhone 14s were in low stock, while the iPhone 14 Plus was completely out of stock.

Sally Gannon said that she and her son were now leaning towards ordering the iPhone online. She said an Apple store employee told them that a phone ordered online would be delivered on Dec. 28.

U.S. electronics chain Best Buy warned earlier this week of shortages of high-end iPhones at its stores this holiday season. read more

Wedbush's Ives expects roughly 8 million iPhones will be sold on the Black Friday weekend, down from 10 million a year ago, mainly due to supply challenges.

And if you want to shop online, he said wait times on Apple's website are now up to 40 days for the new iPhone 14 Pro, which will only grow over the coming weeks as more consumers try to find iPhone Pros to purchase as gifts.

Summary Companies Foxconn Zhengzhou plant's Nov shipments to fall further - source

Worker unhappiness at plant escalated into protests this week

Over 20,000 workers, mostly new recruits, have left - source















TAIPEI, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Foxconn's (2317.TW) flagship iPhone plant in China is set to see a further reduction in November shipments after the latest bout of worker unrest this week, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday, as thousands of employees quit.

The world's largest Apple (AAPL.O) iPhone factory has been grappling with strict COVID-19 restrictions that have fuelled discontent among workers and disrupted production ahead of Christmas and January's Lunar New Year holiday, as many workers were either put into isolation or fled the plant.

Following Wednesday's escalation that saw workers clash with security personnel, Foxconn could now see more than 30% of the site's November production affected, up from an internal estimate of up to 30% when the labour issues erupted in late October, the source said.

The factory is the only one that makes premium iPhone models, including the iPhone 14 Pro, and the source said it is unlikely to resume full production by the end of this month.

Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, declined to comment. Apple, which said on Thursday it had staff at the factory, did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.

""The worker unrest at Foxconn's plant in China could weigh on Apple's November iPhone shipments,"" Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor said, as concerns grow over Apple's ability to deliver products for the busy holiday period.

Apple shares were down 1.9% in late morning trade on Friday, while the benchmark Nasdaq index was down 0.3%.

""Apple is still viewed as one of the more resilient stocks in the tech sector... However, Apple continues to hold off from providing official guidance given the macroeconomic uncertainty,"" Scholar added.

U.S. Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) said on Tuesday it expected high-end iPhones to be in short supply at stores this holiday season. Analysts said iPhones at Apple stores in the United States during the Black Friday shopping season were also down from a year earlier, and it was taking longer to replenish stocks, Reuters reported this week.

Hundreds of workers joined protests at Foxconn's major iPhone plant China's Zhengzhou this week, with some men smashing surveillance cameras and windows, footage uploaded on social media showed.

LOWER SHIPMENTS

KGI Securities analyst Christine Wang said if the current issue lasts through December, around 10 million units of iPhone production will be lost, which translates to 12% lower iPhone shipment in the last quarter of 2022.

Wedbush Securities estimates many Apple stores now have 25% to 30% fewer iPhone 14 Pros than normal heading into the holiday shopping season.

In a statement on Nov. 7, Apple said it expected lower iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max shipments than previously anticipated.

Some new recruits hired in recent weeks by Foxconn claimed they were misled over compensation benefits at the factory, and others complained about sharing dormitories with colleagues who had tested positive for COVID.

Foxconn on Thursday apologised for a pay-related ""technical error"" when hiring and later offered 10,000 yuan ($1,400) to protesting new recruits who agreed to resign and leave.

The source said more than 20,000 workers, mostly new hires not yet working on production lines, took the money and left. Videos posted on Chinese social media on Friday showed crowds and long lines of luggage-laden workers queuing for buses.

""It's time to go home,"" one person posted.

The plant, before its troubles began, employed more than 200,000 staff. It has dormitories, restaurants, basketball courts and a football pitch across its sprawling roughly 1.4 million-square-metre (15 million-square-foot) facility.

Another Foxconn source familiar with the matter said some new hires had left the campus but did not elaborate on how many. This person said that because the people leaving had not yet been trained or begun to work, their departures would not cause further harm to current production.

""The incident has a big impact on our public image but little on our (current) capacity. Our current capacity is not affected,"" the source said.

""There's only so much corporate can do on pandemic prevention ... It's been a problem for a while. This is a problem faced by everyone,"" the person said, pointing to other worker unrest triggered by rigid COVID restrictions, including upheaval at another Apple supplier, Quanta (2382.TW), in May.

Foxconn shares closed down 0.5%, lagging the broader market, (.TWII) which ended flat.

DUBLIN, Nov 28 (Reuters) - The lead privacy regulator for Twitter in the European Union said it was concerned about the potential impact of layoffs at the social media company on its ability to meet privacy obligations, but said it was so far getting answers to its questions.

Twitter has fired top executives and enforced steep job cuts with little warning following billionaire Elon Musk's tumultuous takeover of the company last month. About half of the workforce - around 3,700 employees - has been laid off, while more than 1,000 have resigned.

Prior to the cuts, Twitter employed around 500 people at its European headquarters in Dublin where - like many other tech giants - Ireland's Data Privacy Commissioner (DPC) is the social media platform's lead privacy regulator within the EU.

""We are concerned and we're tracking it very closely. So far we're getting answers to our questions,"" DPC head Helen Dixon told Irish national broadcaster RTE on Monday.

The comments follow similar concerns raised last week by the EU's justice chief around Twitter's ability to comply with tough new rules over illegal online content following a visit to the company's Dublin headquarters.

Dixon said the DPC was in contact with Twitter several times a day to establish what roles remain in place and had ""a range of contacts"" still based at Twitter in Dublin.

""It's a fast-evolving situation, I think where we arrive at the point where we can't get answers and we have no point of contact, then we will be in very serious difficulty,"" Dixon said.

At a basic level, an organisation like Twitter must have a data protection officer in place with a team around them, as well as a board based in Dublin that is making decisions on personal data processing in respect of EU users, she added.

The watchdog said it had also been able to continue with six investigations into Twitter relating to potential privacy breaches that pre-date Musk's acquisition.

592,94,APPLE,2022-11-28,Elon Musk: Apple threatened to yank Twitter from App Store,"













Nov 28 (Reuters) - Elon Musk accused Apple Inc (AAPL.O) of threatening to block Twitter Inc from its app store without saying why in a series of tweets on Monday that also said the iPhone maker had stopped advertising on the social media platform.

The billionaire CEO of Twitter and Tesla said Apple was pressuring Twitter over content moderation demands.

The action, unconfirmed by Apple, would not be unusual as the company has routinely enforced its rules and previously removed apps such as Gab and Parler.

Parler, which is popular with U.S. conservatives, was restored by Apple in 2021 after the app updated its content and moderation practices, the companies said at the time.

""Apple has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter. Do they hate free speech in America?,"" Musk, who took Twitter private for $44 billion last month, said in a tweet.

He later tagged Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook's Twitter account in another tweet, asking ""what's going on here?""

Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

""It wasn't clear to me how far up the Apple food chain that idea went internally and without knowing that, it isn't clear how seriously to take any of this,"" said Randal Picker, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School.

The world's most valuable firm spent an estimated $131,600 on Twitter ads between Nov. 10 and Nov. 16, down from $220,800 between Oct. 16 and Oct. 22, the week before Musk closed the Twitter deal, according to ad measurement firm Pathmatics.

In the first quarter of 2022, Apple was the top advertiser on Twitter, spending $48 million and accounting for more than 4% of total revenue for the period, the Washington Post reported, citing an internal Twitter document.

Twitter did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the report.

'GO TO WAR'

Among the list of grievances tweeted by Musk was the up to 30% fee Apple charges software developers for in-app purchases, with Musk posting a meme suggesting he was willing to ""go to war"" with Apple rather than paying the commission.

The fee has drawn criticism and lawsuits from companies such as Epic Games, the maker of 'Fortnite', while attracting the scrutiny of regulators globally.

The commission could weigh on Musk's attempts to boost subscription revenue at Twitter, in part to make up for the exodus of advertisers over content moderation concerns.

Companies from General Mills Inc (GIS.N) to luxury automaker Audi of America have stopped or paused advertising on Twitter since the acquisition, and Musk said earlier this month that the company had seen a ""massive"" drop in revenue.

Ad sales account for about 90% of Twitter's revenue.

The self-described free speech absolutist, whose company has in the past few days reinstated several Twitter accounts including that of former U.S. President Donald Trump, has blamed activist groups for pressuring advertisers.

Ben Bajarin, the head of consumer technologies at research firm Creative Strategies, said that Musk may be reading too much into a regular process Apple goes through in app review.

""App review from Apple is not perfect by any means and a consistently frustrating process for developers but from what I hear it is a two-way conversation,"" he said.

Nov 28 (Reuters) - Shares of Apple Inc (AAPL.O) fell 1.4% on Monday as growing worker unrest at the world's biggest iPhone factory in China fanned worries of a deeper hit to the already constrained production of higher-end iPhone 14 models.

Reuters reported on Friday that the Foxconn (2317.TW)-operated plant could see a further drop in November shipments as thousands of employees quit amid discontent over strict COVID-19 restrictions to curb rising infections in China.

Separately, a Bloomberg News report citing a source said earlier in the day that there could be a shortfall of 6 million iPhone Pro units this year due to production-related problems.

The shortages kept many consumers from buying the high-end phones during Black Friday - the year's busiest shopping period - and are likely to dampen sales in the crucial holiday quarter.

Wedbush Securities estimated that the production snafus could affect between 5% and 10% of iPhone units in the current quarter. KGI Securities analyst Christine Wang pegged the figure at around 10 million units, or 12%, assuming the issues last through December.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

""The ongoing challenges around delays in returning to a normal level of production at the Zhengzhou facility could limit the pace with which supply-demand equilibrium can be reached in the coming months,"" J.P. Morgan analysts said.

U.S. customers wait for about 33 days for their iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max models to be delivered home, and the same models are not available for in-store pickup, the brokerage said.

Indexes end: S&P 500 -1.54%, Nasdaq -1.58%, Dow -1.45%















Nov 28 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended sharply lower on Monday after protests in major Chinese cities against strict COVID-19 policies sparked concerns about economic growth, while Apple Inc (AAPL.O) slid on worries about a hit to iPhone production.

Shares of the Cupertino, California tech giant lost 2.6% and weighed heavily on the benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX) index as worker unrest at the world's biggest iPhone factory in China fanned fears of a deeper hit to the already constrained production of higher-end phones.

Rare protests in major Chinese cities over the weekend against the country's strict zero-COVID curbs are exacerbating worries about growth in the world's second-largest economy.

""These protests are just evidence that this is a kind of a moving target where, will China continue to try to really constrain COVID's spread?"" said Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.

""Or will they have more of a 'living with COVID' approach that we've seen in the United States and other countries?""

""We think COVID itself and China's policy is one of the key variables for 2023 that would influence stock prices and investors,"" Hainlin said.

S&P 500 stocks

All 11 S&P 500 sector indexes declined, led by real estate (.SPLRCR), down 2.81%, and a 2.74% loss in energy (.SPNY).

U.S. shares of Pinduoduo Inc (PDD.O) surged 12.6% after the Chinese e-commerce platform beat estimates for third-quarter revenue, helped by COVID-related lockdowns in the country that forced consumers to shop online. U.S. shares of other Chinese technology companies also rose, with Baidu (9888.HK) and Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) each gaining over 2%.

The S&P 500 declined 1.54% to end the session at 3,963.95 points.

With two trading days left in November, the S&P 500 is on track for a gain of 2.4% for the month.

Shares of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) rose 0.6% after an industry report estimated spending during Cyber Monday, the biggest U.S. online shopping day, would rise to as much as $11.6 billion.

Trading was mixed in other heavyweight growth stocks, including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O).

Biogen Inc (BIIB.O) fell following a report of death during a clinical study of its experimental Alzheimer's drug.

Shares of cryptocurrency and blockchain-related companies Coinbase Global Inc (COIN.O), Riot Blockchain Inc (RIOT.O) and Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (MARA.O) each fell about 4% following lender BlockFi's bankruptcy filing, the latest casualty since FTX's collapse earlier this month.

This week, investors will keep a close watch on November U.S. consumer confidence data, due on Tuesday; the government's second estimate for third-quarter gross domestic product, due on Wednesday; and November nonfarm payrolls due on Friday.

Declining stocks outnumbered rising ones within the S&P 500 (.AD.SPX) by a 12.2-to-one ratio.

The S&P 500 posted 12 new highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 93 new highs and 174 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was relatively light, with 9.3 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 11.3 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.

595,437,APPLE,2022-11-28,Factbox: A look at industrial disputes in India as Adani port faces protests,"













NEW DELHI, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Clashes between police and villagers over a $900 million port project by the Adani Group are the latest in a series of disputes over industrial projects in India.

Here are some of the major disputes that have involved companies in India over the past decade:

* Construction at Adani's Vizhinjam seaport in southern India's Kerala state has been halted since August this year after protesters, mostly from a Christian fishing community, blocked its entrance, blaming the development for coastal erosion and depriving them of their livelihoods.

* Apple (AAPL.O) supplier Foxconn's (2317.TW) plant in southern India's Tamil Nadu state was shut for days after a mass food-poisoning incident in 2021 sparked employee protests.

* The Karnataka plant of another Apple supplier, Wistron (3231.TW), was also shut down in 2020 after contract workers angry over unpaid wages destroyed property, gear and iPhones.

* Vedanta Ltd's (VDAN.NS) copper smelter in Tamil Nadu was shut down after 13 people died in 2018 when police fired on environmental protesters calling for the closure of the plant. Vedanta has now offered to sell the plant, having repeatedly denied allegations of the smelter being polluting.

* Activists and locals have for years blocked Vedanta's plans to mine bauxite in the green, jungle-clad Niyamgiri hills in Odisha state which the tribe people consider sacred.

* Maruti Suzuki's (MRTI.NS) plant in northern India's Haryana state was shut for nearly a month in 2011 after riots at the plant after workers walked out once the company demanded they sign a ""good conduct bond"", saying some had engaged in sabotage. One person was killed and 90 injured.

596,484,APPLE,2022-11-28,Morning Bid: China + policy hawks = drag on markets,"













Nov 29 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever.

The social unrest flaring up across China - and how Beijing responds to it - remains front and center for Asian markets, suggesting the sentiment driving trading on Tuesday will again be negative.

Just to compound investors' caution, two U.S. Federal Reserve officials on Monday reiterated their conviction that monetary policy must be tightened further and kept at restrictive levels for some time yet in order to get inflation under control.

Let's start with China, where the protests against strict zero-COVID policy and restrictions on freedoms are spreading. Chinese assets are, unsurprisingly, under pressure - the offshore yuan fell on Monday for a fifth straight day and Chinese stocks had their biggest decline in a month.

A little more surprising, however, given the scale of the unrest, is that the declines have been contained and orderly. There is no obvious sense of forced selling. Yet.

It's a hard one to trade. Does the unrest accelerate a re-opening of the economy, or does it prompt President Xi Jingping to double down? Either way, volatility and lack of visibility should prevail in the near term.

One consequence overseas was the slide in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) shares on Monday, down 2.7% as worker unrest at the world's biggest iPhone factory in China stoked fears of a deeper hit to the already constrained production of higher-end phones.

Apple is now underperforming the broader market this year.

St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and New York Fed President John Williams dealt another blow to markets on Monday, signaling that rates will reach at least 5% and might not be cut at all next year. Traders are on board with the first bit, but certainly not the second - 40 basis points of easing is still implied in next year's rates curve.

chart

ECB President Christine Lagarde also struck a hawkish tone on Monday, saying inflation has not peaked and may yet surprise on the upside. If anyone was in any doubt, the hawks at the big central banks are not backing down.

Risk assets are under pressure - Wall Street closed deeply in the red on Monday - while volatility and the dollar both rose. That's the backdrop to the Asian session on Tuesday, so it looks like being another cautious open.

Three key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Tuesday:

- Japan unemployment (October)

- Japan retail sales (October)

- Germany inflation (November, prelim)

597,786,APPLE,2022-11-28,Irish privacy regulator fines Facebook 265 mln euros,"













DUBLIN, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Ireland's data privacy regulator imposed a 265 million euro ($277 million) fine on social media giant Facebook on Monday, bringing the total it has fined parent group Meta (META.O) to almost 1 billion euros.

The penalty resulted from an investigation, started last year, into the discovery of a collated set of personal data that had been scraped from Facebook between May 2018 and September 2019, and made available online.

Facebook was also ordered to make a range of corrective measures.

Meta said it had cooperated fully with the investigation by Ireland's Data Privacy Commissioner (DPC) and made changes to its systems during the time in question, including removing the ability to scrape its features in this way using phone numbers.

Monday's fine is the fourth the DPC has levied against one of Meta's companies. It is Meta's lead privacy regulator within the European Union, and has 13 more inquiries into the social media group outstanding.

In September the watchdog hit its Instagram subsidiary with a record fine of 405 million euros, which Meta plans to appeal. Meta added in its statement on Monday that it was reviewing the decision related to the latest fine.

The DPC regulates Apple, Google, Twitter, Tiktok and other technology giants due to the location of their EU headquarters in Ireland. It currently has 40 inquiries open into such firms, including the 13 involving Meta.

The regulator has the power to impose fines of up to 4% of a company's global revenue under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation's (GDPR) ""One Stop Shop"" regime introduced in 2018.

The DPC said mitigating factors in Monday's decision - which had been approved by all other relevant EU regulators - included the actions Facebook had taken.

""We'll keep going until the behaviour does change,"" Ireland's Data Privacy Commissioner (DPC) Helen Dixon told Irish national broadcaster RTE on Monday.

598,825,APPLE,2022-11-29,"Behind Foxconn’s China woes: mistrust, miscommunication, COVID curbs","













SHANGHAI/TAIPEI, Nov 29 (Reuters) - When officials from his Chinese village approached Hou last month, urging him to work at the world's largest iPhone factory for at least twice the usual pay, he knew it was risky.

Tens of thousands of workers had fled the plant in central China in previous weeks and violent protests had erupted over a COVID-19 lockdown and confusion over hiring bonuses.

But Hou, 24, who asked to be identified only by his family name, told Reuters he took the job at the Zhengzhou plant belonging to Foxconn (2317.TW), Apple's biggest iPhone maker, making 70% of iPhones globally.

The crisis could cut production for November at the factory by at least 30%, a Foxconn source told Reuters on Thursday, a development that has hit Apple's share price.

The plant owned by Taiwan-based Foxconn, battered by China's strict COVID restrictions and facing critical year-end holiday demand, was offering enticing hiring bonuses and excellent pay.

Hou said he was promised up to 30,000 yuan ($4,200) for just under four months' work - far above the 12,000-16,000 yuan Foxconn workers usually get for four months.

But he said he had not bargained on a 10-day spell in quarantine and the sudden notification that employees would have to work an extra month before receiving their hiring bonuses.

Such grievances, Hou and two other workers told Reuters, prompted them to confront Foxconn management at the plant - essentially a city of more than 200,000 employees - leading to sporadic clashes that made headlines worldwide.

In a rare example of large-scale labour unrest in China, Foxconn workers in COVID masks clashed with security personnel in white hazmat suits holding plastic shields. Some demonstrators smashed surveillance cameras and windows with sticks.

In addition to the challenges of keeping factory lines operating under a closed-loop system mandated under Beijing's zero-COVID policy - requiring workers be isolated from the wider world - Foxconn's turmoil also exposed communication problems and a mistrust among workers of management at the top Apple supplier.

""Nothing they said counted for anything,"" Hou said from his hometown after taking a 10,000-yuan payout Foxconn offered on Thursday to protesting workers who agreed to leave.

Hou, who had worked in jobs such as sales and says he was told no factory experience was necessary, never made it to the production line.

'MY LIFE WAS WORTH MORE'

[1/4] The logo of Foxconn is seen outside the company's building in Taipei, Taiwan November 10, 2022. REUTERS/Ann Wang/File Photo/ 1 2 3 4

Five other workers said at the time that they were afraid because Foxconn began shifting COVID-positive people to a vacant housing project without disclosing the infections and told workers to eat in their dormitories instead of company canteens, but then failed to segregate infected workers from others.

Foxconn declined to comment on the claims by Hou and other workers, referring Reuters to past statements.

The company previously apologised to workers for a pay-related ""technical error"" that it said occurred when it was hiring. It has not said why it was paying people to leave soon after promising them hiring bonuses.

In late October, after scenes of fleeing workers started trickling out, Foxconn said it was bringing the situation under control and was coordinating with other plants to increase production.

If the problems persist through December, it will cost Foxconn and Apple the output of around 10 million iPhones, equal to cutting iPhone shipments 12% in the fourth quarter, said KGI Securities analyst Christine Wang.

Foxconn managers said the company was caught in a difficult position, having to speed up shipments during Apple's most important holiday season while following local government's strict COVID guidelines.

""It was the busiest time of the year,"" said a senior Foxconn official, adding that an October COVID outbreak on the Zhengzhou campus caught the company off guard and triggered ""a mess"".

""There was pressure for everyone, including for the local government,"" the official said, referring to local authorities rushing to help recruit replacement workers.

What happened at the plant was the ""epitome"" of what companies face under China's rigid COVID policy, and it will ""push production lines out of China at a greater speed"", the official said.

Marina Zhang, an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Australia-China Relations Institute, said Foxconn's woes sent a message to companies trying to keep Chinese operations going and keep workers COVID-free in line with national policy.

""A company’s internal communications can be totally overpowered, overwhelmed by social media,"" Zhang said. ""They lose power to social media – no one is going to listen to them.""

One worker, Fay, said he feared catching COVID and anguished whether to stay on for two more weeks to claim a bonus for completing his three-month contract. Eventually, he says, he crawled out through a hole in a green metal fence.

""In the end, I decided that my life was worth more.""

Summary Companies Investors look to Powell speech for interest rate clues

U.S. consumer confidence slips in November

S&P 500 -0.16%, Nasdaq -0.59%, Dow +0.01%















Nov 29 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended down on Tuesday, with losses in Apple and Amazon ahead of an upcoming speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that could provide hints about magnitude of future interest rate hikes.

Investors also focused on recent protests against COVID-19 curbs in China, including at the world's biggest iPhone factory.

Apple's (AAPL.O) stock dropped 2.1%, down for a fourth straight session.

Powell is due to speak at a Brookings Institution event on Wednesday about the outlook for the U.S. economy and the labor market. Investors will be looking for clues about when the Fed will slow the pace of its aggressive interest rate hikes.

""No one is willing to buy ahead of tomorrow with Powell speaking. Everyone is nervous about what he is going to say,"" said Ron Saba, senior portfolio manager at Horizon Investments in Charlotte.

Shares of Amazon (AMZN.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Tesla (TSLA.O) each lost more than 1%.

The benchmark S&P 500 index (.SPX) is headed for its second straight month of gains in November amid bets that recent inflation readings showing a slight cooling in prices will lead the Fed to scale back the scale of its interest rate hikes.

The Fed has delivered four straight 75 basis point rate hikes, and it is expected to shift down the pace to a 50-bps move in December. FEDWATCH

A survey on Tuesday showed U.S. consumer confidence eased further in November amid persistent worries about the rising cost of living.

Mainland China's recent wave of civil disobedience comes as the number of COVID cases hit record daily highs and large parts of several cities face new lockdowns, further threatening the world's second largest economy.

The S&P 500 energy sector index (.SPNY) rallied 1.3%, while gains in oil prices on expectations of a loosening of China's strict COVID controls were later offset by concerns that OPEC+ would keep its output unchanged at its upcoming meeting.

The S&P 500 declined 0.16% to end the session at 3,957.60 points.

The Nasdaq declined 0.59% to 10,983.78 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.01% to 33,852.13 points.

Despite the S&P 500's decline, advancing issues outnumbered falling ones (.AD.SPX) by a 1.3-to-one ratio.

The S&P 500 posted three new highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 68 new highs and 183 new lows.

U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies Alibaba Group Holding Ltd , Pinduoduo Inc (PDD.O) and JD.com Inc jumped more than 5% after China broadened equity financing channels for property developers.

Shares of Chinese internet firm Bilibili Inc soared 22% after posting upbeat quarterly results.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was relatively light, with 9.6 billion shares traded, compared with an average of 11.2 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.

601,349,APPLE,2022-11-29,Apple's iPhone Pro shipments may fall 20 mln units short of estimates - analyst,"













Nov 29 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max model shipments could miss market expectations by up to 20 million units in the holiday quarter due to labor unrest at a major Chinese factory, TF Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said.

Kuo is the latest to flag a hit to the world's most valuable company from protests over pay and strict COVID-19 curbs at the world's biggest iPhone factory, the Foxconn (2317.TW)-operated plant in the central city of Zhengzhou.

He trimmed his estimate for quarterly iPhone shipments by about 20% to between 70 million and 75 million units, compared with the market consensus of 80 million to 85 million units.

Apple shares were trading down more than 2%, set to add to the 6% decline so far this month as worries grow over shipments in the all-important holiday sales season.

Kuo, in a blog post on Tuesday, also predicted that the supply shortfall could erase demand for the more popular Pro models, instead of deferring sales, as consumers also grapple with a weakening economy.

In contrast, other Apple analysts expect sales to pick up once production constraints ease and more Pro models become available.

""We note that Pro devices are sold out into early January, but we expect some of the missed revenue to trickle in the March-quarter,"" CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said on Monday.

The constraints are coming at the worst possible time and are the most severe since the early days of the pandemic, Zino said.

Some analysts signaled the possibility of the challenges extending into 2023.

""I can't imagine 2023 will be a solid year for Apple iPhones,"" said Zeno Mercer, research analyst at investment advisory firm ROBO Global.

""Those looking to make an upgrade have, and otherwise disposable income for next-gen phones should be down.""

602,118,APPLE,2022-11-29,"Spotify, Epic Games get ally in Musk in fight against Apple fees","













LONDON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's declaration of war on Apple (AAPL.O) in a series of tweets on Monday gives Spotify and Fortnite maker Epic Games a powerful ally in taking the tech giant to task over its 30% App Store fees.

Musk criticized the fee Apple charges software developers for in-app purchases, and posted a meme suggesting he was willing to ""go to war"" rather than pay the levy. Musk also suggested Apple had threatened to block Twitter from its app store, although he did not explain why.

loading

Spotify has previously submitted antitrust complaints against the iPhone-maker in Europe, and Epic Games sued Apple in the United States in 2020.

Since buying Twitter last month, Musk has unveiled plans to charge users $8 per month for getting verified on the social media platform to boost its profitability and avoid bankruptcy. A 30% cut on that would be a big dent to those plans.

The European Commission has been investigating whether Apple's rules for app developers violate its rules after Spotify filed an antitrust case against Apple in 2019.

Apple risks a fine as much as 10% of its global turnover if found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules.

Luke Suddards, analyst at investment insights firm Finimize, said Apple was ""playing a dangerous game"" by threatening to pull Twitter from its App Store.

""If Twitter was kicked off, there could be another lawsuit developing. We saw Elon Musk use the courts effectively during his Twitter purchase and it would be no surprise if he pursued the same strategy now.""

Earlier this month, ""Fortnite"" video game maker Epic Games asked a three-judge U.S. federal appeals panel to overturn portions of a lower court antitrust ruling that largely favoured Apple and its App Store payment business.

Apple had said the commissions it gets help it fund reviews of apps to ensure consumers are not exposed to fraudulent, pornographic or privacy-intrusive apps.

""Apple continues to disadvantage competitors, and the impact is huge - on consumers, app developers, and now, authors and publishers. Without policymakers taking action, nothing will change,"" Spotify CEO Daniel Ek wrote on Twitter last month.

Musk, who was in the process of buying Twitter at that time, wrote ""concerning"" in response to Ek's post.

But some analysts are concerned that going to battle with Apple might push more users away from Twitter.

""While Musk seeks to reignite the ongoing battle between Apple and developers, all of this negativity will drive Twitter users away,"" said Paolo Pescatore, an analyst with PP Foresight.

""People will not ditch their iPhones... They have been accustomed to signing up to different social services but only use one phone at a time,"" he said.

Apple, Twitter and Spotify did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

603,17,APPLE,2022-11-29,Reactions to Apple supplier Foxconn's labour unrest,"













Nov 29 (Reuters) - Thousands of employees at Foxconn's (2317.TW) flagship iPhone plant in China have quit since last week, as the major Apple (AAPL.O) supplier battles the latest bout of labour unrest that began in late October due to strict zero-COVID policy.

Following are reactions from experts:

PIA GISGARD, HEAD OF SUSTAINABILITY AND GOVERNANCE AT SWEDBANK ROBUR

""The events taking place at Foxconn’s production facility are worrying and highly undesirable from workplace health, safety and general wellbeing, and harmony perspectives.""

""We see that in these times of unrest, Apple needs to intensify its dialogue with Foxconn management, and if possible Chinese authorities, to communicate in strong terms what its policy expectations are around labour rights, and find solutions to stabilise the situation.""

""Foxconn is bound to follow Chinese government orders regarding COVID lockdowns. The important thing is that the company implements these orders in a way which respects people’s rights and doesn’t go beyond the government requirements resulting in unnecessarily harsh measures.""

ERIC PEDERSEN, HEAD OF RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENTS, NORDEA ASSET MANAGEMENT

""The situation at Foxconn is concerning.""

""We note the role Foxconn plays as a subcontractor, to Apple, among others. As a first step, we have contacted Apple to understand how management views and addresses the on-going situation and what measures they are taking.""

JANNE WERNING, HEAD OF ESG CAPITAL MARKETS & STEWARDSHIP AT UNION INVESTMENT

""This shows the importance of labour standards in the supply chain. We expect Apple, as one of the main buyers, to reassert its influence at Foxconn. As a result, the situation at Foxconn with regard to labour standards has already improved in recent years, according to our findings, so that Foxconn is in a better position compared to other factories in China.

""However, there is still a great need for improvement in an international comparison.""

CHRISTINA O'CONNELL, SENIOR MANAGER FOR SUMOFUS, A NON-PROFIT CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY GROUP

""The extreme dependence of Apple on China, both as a (consumer) market and as its place of primary manufacturing, we see that a very risky situation.""

604,21,APPLE,2022-11-29,Musk’s Apple fight could be his Twitter legacy,"













NEW YORK, Nov 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elon Musk doesn’t just want to force changes at Twitter. The social network’s new owner is now targeting Apple (AAPL.O), the smartphone giant he has vowed to eclipse in market value. Musk isn’t the first to complain that Apple acts as a gatekeeper for companies distributing apps through its platforms. But his social-media megaphone makes him a powerful foe. Putting pressure on Apple’s business model could be the most durable outcome of his $44 billion foray.

A flurry of tweets from Musk on Monday brought two specific concerns. First, he criticized Apple’s fee of up to 30% on transactions through its App Store. Musk will have to turbocharge Twitter’s profitability to service its crushing buyout debt, and high-margin subscriptions are one promising avenue. Losing a chunk of every $8 that a user pays to become a Twitter Blue subscriber makes that harder.

loading

Companies from Netflix (NFLX.O) to Spotify Technology (SPOT.N) have battled the iPhone-making California goliath over this issue, leading to heated negotiations and special carve-outs. Governments, too, have taken a swing: South Korea legislated that Apple must allow alternative payment processing options. It led to little change – Apple’s alternative in the country still carries a 26% fee.

Second, Musk attacked Apple’s policy of asking developers to moderate content in apps sold through its App Store. The iPhone maker bars alternatives to its own store on the iPhone, which is how it mediates access to its users. Whatever the pretext for current complaints, that restriction could stymie Musk’s own opposition to moderation, and moreover his ambitions to build Twitter into a platform-like “super-app” that potentially usurps Apple’s storefront. Videogame developer Epic Games sued Apple in part over this very issue, a fight Apple won.

Apple boss Tim Cook could respond to all this in two ways. He could toss Musk a sweetheart deal, finding a way to fit Twitter into an exempted category that allows it to escape the usual 30% commission. Or he could ignore the billionaire, which could incentivize Musk to go all-in. That’s the riskier path, given Musk’s ownership of America’s pre-eminent soapbox, and one used liberally as a platform by politicians of all stripes. Already, Musk has asked whether Apple might “hate free speech.”

It’s one thing for Apple to contend with lawmakers in peripheral markets like South Korea and the Netherlands, where Cook has allowed some limited changes to the App Store. But if Musk turns up the heat on its business model in what is still the iPhone’s most important market, he could wreak major changes on the technology world – whether he makes a success out of Twitter or not.

605,59,APPLE,2022-11-30,Spotify CEO renews attack on Apple after Musk's salvo,"













STOCKHOLM, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Spotify's (SPOT.N) CEO Daniel Ek renewed his attack on Apple (AAPL.O) on Wednesday in a series of tweets alleging the iPhone maker ""gives itself every advantage while at the same time stifling innovation and hurting consumers"".

loading

Ek tagged a number of sympathetic business leaders in his 21-tweet thread, including Musk, Microsoft president Brad Smith, and Proton founder Andy Yen.

On Monday, the world's richest person Elon Musk criticized the fee Apple charges software developers - including his Twitter business - for in-app purchases, and posted a meme suggesting he was willing to ""go to war"" rather than pay it.

Spotify has previously submitted antitrust complaints against Apple in various countries, alleging the 30% charge has forced Spotify to ""artificially inflate"" its own prices.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. It has previously said the 30% cut it takes on purchases made in its App Store is used to protect consumers in areas such as fraud and privacy.

Tim Sweeney, the CEO of ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games, tweeted on Wednesday that fighting Apple's ""monopoly"" was ""an American issue transcending party politics"".

""So how much longer will we look away from this threat to the future of the internet? How many more consumers will be denied choice? There's been a lot of talk. Talk is helpful but we need action,"" Ek wrote.

Musk is expected to talk with European Commissioner Thierry Breton via videocall on Wednesday afternoon, though the agenda was unknown. The pair previously met in Texas in May, ahead of Musk's $44 billion purchase of Twitter, where they signaled broad agreement on EU tech regulation policy.

Nov 30 (Reuters) - Elon Musk on Wednesday tweeted that the misunderstanding about Twitter potentially being removed from Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) App Store was resolved following his meeting with the iPhone maker's (AAPL.O) Chief Executive Tim Cook.

""Tim was clear that Apple never considered doing so,"" the billionaire CEO of Twitter and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) said in a tweet.

On Monday, Musk had accused Apple of threatening to block Twitter from its app store without saying why in a series of tweets that also said it had stopped advertising on the social media platform.

He had later tagged Cook's Twitter account in another tweet, asking ""what's going on here?""

Twitter and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Musk's latest tweet. Apple has not responded publicly to Musk's earlier tweets.

Among the list of grievances tweeted by Musk on Monday was the up to 30% fee Apple charges software developers for in-app purchases, with Musk posting a meme suggesting he was willing to ""go to war"" with Apple rather than paying the commission.

607,153,APPLE,2022-11-30,Analysis: Apple supply chain data shows receding exposure to China as risks mount,"[1/2] A man talks on a phone in front of an Apple logo outside its store, following the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Shanghai, China, November 7, 2022. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo















SHANGHAI, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) wide exposure to Chinese manufacturing, notable both for its low costs and rising risks, has receded since the COVID-19 pandemic began, company supply chain data shows.

With the world's biggest iPhone factory, operated in central China by Foxconn (2317.TW), battling production shortfalls and labour unrest spurred largely by Beijing's harsh virus containment policies, analysts expect the risks - and Apple's retreat - to accelerate.

A Reuters analysis of Apple's supply chain data shows China's prominence in the company's global manufacturing is declining: In the five years to 2019, China was the primary location of 44% to 47% of its suppliers' production sites, but that fell to 41% in 2020, and 36% in 2021.

Apple did not reply to a request for comment.

The data shows how a diversification drive by Apple and its suppliers, with investments in India and Vietnam and increased procurement from Taiwan, the United States and elsewhere, is reshaping the global supply structure, although analysts and academics say it will remain heavily exposed to China for many years to come.

""The China supply chain is not going to evaporate overnight,"" said Eli Friedman, an associate professor at Cornell University who studies labour in China.

""Decoupling is just not realistic for these companies for the time being,"" he said, although he expected diversification to accelerate.

The concentration of suppliers in China, the site of most production by Foxconn which accounts for 70% of iPhones made globally, has been a key feature for Apple, the world's most profitable smartphone vendor.

But the strategy is shifting, driven not just by China's COVID-related lockdowns and restrictions, but by rising trade and geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington that pose potential long-term risks.

Foxconn is stepping up its expansion in India, with a plan to quadruple the workforce at its iPhone factory over two years, government officials with knowledge of the matter told Reuters earlier this month.

J.P.Morgan expects Apple to move about 5% of iPhone 14 production to India from late this year and to make one in four iPhones in India by 2025, and estimates that about 25% of all Apple products, including Mac PCs, iPads, Apple Watches and AirPods, will be manufactured outside China by 2025 versus 5% now.

The Apple supplier data to 2021, however, shows no locations so far that stand out as substantial gainers to match China's decline, according to the Reuters analysis.

The United States rose the most to 10.7% in 2021 from 7.2% in 2019, followed by Taiwan with an increase to 9.5% from 6.7%. India was still a relatively minor presence, rising to 1.5% from less than 1%, while Vietnam expanded to 3.7% from 2.2%.

""Vietnam and India are not China. They can't produce at that scale, at the quality and with the turnaround time, with the reliability of infrastructure,"" said Cornell University's Friedman.

Apple's annual data covers more than 600 locations among its top suppliers, which represent 98% of Apple's direct spending. Apple does not disclose how much it spends with each supplier, and those on the list can change each year as different companies make the cutoff among Apple's thousands of suppliers.

They include contract manufacturers that assemble iPhones, iPads, watches and wireless headphones, as well as suppliers of chips, glass, aluminium casings, cables, circuit boards and other components.

While Apple's shift from China is increasingly evident, including in its own supply chain data, so too are the risks from the concentration of operations there.

The labour issues at Foxconn's China plant are due in large part to the demands of Beijing's COVID containment policy, which require that workers be isolated from the wider world in closed-loop systems to keep factory lines operating.

The unrest has attracted the attention of investors, who are conscious of the human rights aspects as well as production targets.

""The important thing is that the company implements these orders in a way which respects people's rights,"" said Pia Gisgard, head of sustainability and governance at Swedbank Robur, which held Apple shares worth around $1.3 billion as of end-September according to Refinitiv data.

608,307,APPLE,2022-11-30,Tata in talks to buy Wistron's India facility for up to $613 mln -report,"













BENGALURU, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Tata Group is in talks to buy Wistron Corp's (3231.TW) only manufacturing facility in India for up to 50 billion rupees ($612.6 million), the Economic Times business daily reported Wednesday, citing people familiar with the discussions.

If it fails to strike a deal to buy the facility in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, Tata could consider a joint venture with Taiwan's Wistron – one of Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) top vendors in India – the report said, citing sources close to Tata.

Tata Electronics, a unit of salt-to-software conglomerate Tata Group, already supplies components to Apple from its Hosur unit in Tamil Nadu, which neighbours Karnataka, according to the report.

Tata, Wistron and Apple did not immediately respond to Reuters' e-mailed requests for comment.

Bloomberg had reported in September that Tata was in talks with Wistron to establish a joint venture to assemble iPhones in India.

Currently, iPhones are assembled in India by at least three of Apple's global suppliers – Wistron in Karnataka, as well as Foxconn (2317.TW) and Pegatron (4938.TW) in Tamil Nadu.

Cupertino, California-headquartered Apple has bet big on India since it began iPhone assembly in the country in 2017 via Wistron and later with Foxconn, in line with the Indian government's push for local manufacturing.

J.P.Morgan analysts estimate Apple may make one out of four iPhones in India by 2025 as the tech giant moves some production away from China, amid mounting geopolitical tensions and strict COVID-19 lockdowns in the country.

Dec 20 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) warned in November that worker unrest at the world's biggest iPhone factory in China would impact shipments of higher-end models of the device in the holiday quarter.

Some Wall Street analysts have started estimating a hit from the disruptions, which have weighed on shares of the world's most valuable company. Here are their predictions:

610,467,APPLE,2022-11-30,Foxconn asks workers for referrals to replenish China plant's staff,"













SHANGHAI, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) supplier Foxconn on Wednesday offered a 1,000 yuan ($141.11) award to staff who successfully recommend people to work at its plant in China's Zhengzhou city, as it tries to replenish depleted staff numbers there after recent unrest.

The offer was made on the WeChat account belonging to the plant's recruitment team, which said workers would receive 500 yuan if the person stayed for 15 days, and another 500 yuan if they made it to a month. Typically, a Foxconn worker makes between 3,000 to 4,000 yuan a month.

Apple and Foxconn have warned that iPhone shipments will be impacted by the events of the past month at the giant plant, which saw tens of thousands of workers flee after it was hit by COVID. Last week, violent protests erupted at the facility over a bonus issue, prompted several others to leave.

The crisis could cut production for November at the factory which employed over 200,000 people before the unrest, by at least 30%, a Foxconn source told Reuters on Thursday.

Foxconn has already upped bonuses for existing workers, and is offering higher pay packages for new workers.

On Tuesday, it also put out a call for workers who left to return saying that the factory's operations and life there was slowing returning to normal as the COVID situation there improved, according to a separate statement from the same WeChat account.

Zhengzhou city late on Tuesday announced the ""orderly"" resumption of businesses, including supermarkets, gyms and restaurants, though it also published a long list of buildings that would remain under lockdown.

On Wednesday, the Zhengzhou Airport Economic Zone where the Foxconn plant is located, said it would undertake those measures from Dec. 1.

Foxconn did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it the relaxation of rules would be implemented at its Zhengzhou site, or if it would continue to implement a closed loop system, which sees the company isolate the factory and workers.

611,354,APPLE,2022-11-30,U.S. Treasury Yellen: Twitter should be held to certain standards for content,"













NEW YORK, Nov 30 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Wednesday said social media company Twitter should be held to certain standards for content, arguing that it is ""not that different"" from radio stations and broadcasters subject to such rules.

Speaking at the New York Times Dealbook Summit in New York, Yellen also said she believed that there were legitimate national security concerns related to TikTok, the Chinese-owned video sharing app.

Yellen declined to say whether the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) was conducting a review of Twitter after some calls for a probe of a Saudi Arabian stake in the company after billionaire Elon Musk's takeover of the platform.

She said CFIUS looks closely at acquisitions and investments in U.S. firms by foreign buyers that could pose national security risks.

""I'm not going to say specifically what we are or aren't looking at,"" Yellen said. ""We don't comment on work that's in progress. But if there are such risks, it would be appropriate for CFIUS to have a look.""

Musk on Monday accused Apple of threatening to block Twitter from its app store and said Apple was pressuring Twitter over content moderation demands.

Yellen said she believed it was appropriate for mobile technology giants Apple (AAPL.O) and Google (GOOGL.O) to demand certain content standards.

""I think it's a good thing, if Apple is looking at the content. Most broadcast stations are subjected to standards in terms of what they broadcast to the public. And Twitter's not really that different than other broadcast stations,"" Yellen said.

Asked if it was good that such platforms were overseeing content, Yellen said. ""It's a kind of control that I think is needed.""

Regarding TikTok, which U.S. FBI Director Chris Wray said raises national security concerns due to the risk that the Chinese government could harness the video-sharing app to influence users or control their devices, Yellen said she also believed there were ""legitimate national security concerns.""

""That's something that's a case in progress,"" Yellen added.

REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni















Dec 1 (Reuters) - Apple TV+’s 2022 slavery drama “Emancipation"", actor Will Smith's first film since his famous slap of comedian Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars, has received mixed early reviews from film critics.

The movie has scored a 59% positive rating on Rotton Tomatoes so far, with 14 out of 24 reviewers applauding the film as of Thursday afternoon.

The movie directed by Antoine Fuqua is based on the true 1863 story of a former slave named Gordon, called Peter in the film, and the photographs taken of his battered back that depict the brutalities of American chattel slavery. It is scheduled to arrive in theaters on Dec. 9.

The first batch of reviews have earned “Emancipation” the rotten label, as many reviewers voice their disappointment in the historical action film’s execution.

“Emancipation devolves into a confused jumble of messages,” Lovia Gyarke from The Hollywood Reporter wrote.

Several critics however applauded Smith’s performance as the lead. Johnny Oleksinski from the New York Post praised Smith’s ""rich emotionality and laser-focused intensity"".

Smith had already completed filming of ""Emancipation"" when he walked onto the Academy Awards stage in March and slapped Rock for making a joke about the hairstyle of his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. The ""King Richard"" star, who won best actor shortly after the assault, was banned from attending the Oscars for 10 years, but he remains eligible for nominations and awards.

During the Los Angeles premiere of the film on Wednesday, Reuters asked Smith how it felt to be back in public at a Hollywood event. ""So far, so good,"" he said.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration















Dec 1 (Reuters) - The parent company of social media platform Parler and American rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye, have agreed to terminate the intent of the sale of Parler, according to a statement from Parlement Technologies on Thursday.

""This decision was made in the interest of both parties in mid-November,"" the company said in a statement. ""Parler will continue to pursue future opportunities for growth and the evolution of the platform for our vibrant community.""

Parlement Technologies and Ye had announced plans for the deal in October. At the time the company said it expected the deal to close during the fourth quarter of 2022.

Ye has been criticized in recent months for making anti-Semitic remarks. On Nov. 22 he dined with former U.S. President Donald Trump at Trump's private club in Florida along with Nick Fuentes, a prominent white supremacist.

In September, Ye terminated his partnership with apparel retailer Gap Inc (GPS.N). German sporting goods maker Adidas (ADSGn.DE) terminated its partnership with Ye in October.

Parler, which launched in 2018, has been reinstated on Google and Apple Inc's app stores after being removed following the U.S. Capitol riots in January 2021. Parler is one of several social media platforms, including Gettr, Gab and Truth Social, that have positioned themselves as free-speech alternatives to Twitter Inc prior to its new ownership under billionaire Elon Musk.

614,400,APPLE,2022-12-01,Taiwan's Foxconn slowly checks into iPhone detox,"













HONG KONG, Dec 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Covid-19 lockdowns and protests across China have highlighted the risks of the mutual dependence between Taiwan's Foxconn and its top customer Apple (AAPL.O). Even before the recent supply chain disruptions and violent protests that disrupted production in the People’s Republic, the Cupertino giant has been hedging its exposure to Foxconn.

The two-decade-plus partnership has been transformational for both sides. The $45 billion Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry (2317.TW), is now the world's largest contract manufacturer of electronics with production hubs in China and elsewhere. It makes 70% of the world’s iPhones, according to Fubon Research. Meanwhile Apple’s huge investments into Foxconn have paid off: the U.S. company is the most profitable smartphone maker by far. Boss Tim Cook is also turning to Foxconn to expand in India, Vietnam and Mexico as he steps up efforts to diversify supply chains out of China, which have suffered under Beijing’s heavy-handed pandemic containment efforts and tensions with the United States.

However, thanks to dramatic labour unrest and pandemic disruptions, Apple's premium handset delivery volumes could miss expectations by up to a fifth, or 20 million units, during the all-important holiday season, according to TF Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Foxconn has been scrambling to contain the fallout, offering bonuses to temporary workers and shifting production to other facilities. In the meantime, however, Apple has probably been forced to send more orders to Taiwanese rival Pegatron (4938.TW) and Guangdong-based Luxshare (002475.SZ).

This is bad news for Foxconn, which is expected to generate more than half of revenue this year from Apple, per JP Morgan analysts. The bank also forecasts that Foxconn's manufacturing share of iPhones will decline to 57% by 2025, while Shenzhen-listed Luxshare's will more than triple to 24%. Foxconn’s shares have vastly underperformed both Apple and Luxshare over the past five years.

Foxconn chief Liu Young-way might not mind a bit of distance, however. Rising labour costs and brutal price wars with Luxshare have hurt. Apple's strict procurement rules prevent Foxconn from sourcing or manufacturing many components on its own, making it hard to cut costs through vertical integration, according to Morningstar analysts. Gross margins have fallen to roughly 6% in 2021 from 8% a decade ago.

Liu hopes ventures into electric cars, batteries and more can lift that number to 10% by 2025. If they do, he might find iPhone withdrawal more tolerable.

Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision, popularly known as Foxconn, could see more than 30% of iPhone production at its major Zhengzhou factory affected after violent protests erupted over Covid-19 restrictions and confusion over hiring bonuses, Reuters reported on Nov. 25, citing a source. More than 20,000 workers have left the plant.

The factory is the only one that makes premium models, including the iPhone 14 Pro. Overall, Foxconn manufactures 70% of iPhones globally, according to Fubon Research.

In late October, videos of fleeing workers went viral. At the time, Foxconn said it was bringing the situation under control and was coordinating with other plants to increase production.

615,812,APPLE,2022-12-01,Trial of Hong Kong's Lai delayed as Beijing weighs ruling on foreign lawyers,"[1/4] Armed police stand guard as they escort a prison van that is believed to carry media mogul Jimmy Lai, founder of Apple Daily, to the High Court in Hong Kong, China, December 1, 2022. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu















HONG KONG, Dec 1 (Reuters) - A Hong Kong court on Thursday adjourned to December 13 the high-profile trial of tycoon and China critic Jimmy Lai, who faces several charges of collusion with foreign countries under a China-imposed national security law.

The postponement of the trial by three High Court judges comes three days after Hong Kong authorities asked China's highest legislative body to decide whether to block foreign lawyers from national security cases, including a British barrister, Timothy Owen, who now leads Lai's legal team.

Lai's legal team did not oppose the adjournment.

Lai is one of the most prominent Hong Kong critics of China's Communist Party leadership, and his case is being closely watched by the public, legal community and diplomats amid fears that Hong Kong's rule of law is being undermined.

Hong Kong's Department of Justice has made repeated attempts to block Owen from defending Lai.

But Hong Kong's highest court, the Court of Final Appeal, on Monday dismissed its application to impose a ""blanket ban"" on foreign lawyers working on national security cases.

Following this setback, city leader John Lee requested China's National People's Congress Standing Committee to make an interpretation on the matter, in a ruling that is expected to come ""as soon as possible"" Lee said.

This is only the sixth time since Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 that such an ""interpretation"" has been sought, with critics saying such moves undermine the city's judicial independence.

Lai, who appeared in court in a grey jacket, faces a maximum possible life sentence, including for two counts of conspiracy to commit collusion with foreign countries or external elements.

He also faces a sedition charge linked to his Apple Daily newspaper that was forced to close in June 2021 after a police raid and a freeze on its assets.

The court was told that Hong Kong's immigration department had withheld an extension of a work visa for Owen.

The immigration department did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

616,338,APPLE,2022-12-01,Piper Sandler cuts estimates for Apple's Dec quarter as China worries mount,"













Dec 1 (Reuters) - Analysts at Piper Sandler on Thursday cut their revenue and iPhone sales estimates for Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) December quarter, as Beijing's strict lockdowns crimp production at the world's biggest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, China.

The brokerage now expects $119 billon in revenue for the current quarter from an earlier projection of $127.3 billion, with iPhone unit sales of about 74 million against 83 million previously expected.

""More than 50% of assembled iPhones come from Foxconn's (2317.TW) Zhengzhou plant. Majority of the disruptions took place in the month of November where utilization for the plant may have fallen to 50% or below,"" the analysts said.

China's manufacturing and services activities shrank further in November to seven-month lows, official data showed, stung by the country's zero-COVID policy and rising infections that analysts said will hurt the economy well into 2023.

Production woes for Apple were heightened by a rare example of large-scale labour unrest in China, where Foxconn workers clashed with security personnel in Zhengzhou.

Apple might prioritize iPhone 14 Pro production over other models, the brokerage said, given the higher average selling price for the product.

Dec 1 (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) will offer advanced 4-nanometer chips when its new $12-billion plant in Arizona opens in 2024, spurred by U.S. customers including Apple Inc (AAPL.O) to do so, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.

TSMC is expected to announce the new plan when U.S. President Joe Biden and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo visit Phoenix for a ceremony next Tuesday, according to the report, citing people familiar with the matter.

TSMC previously said it would make 20,000 wafers per month at the Arizona facility but the production may increase from those original plans, the report said. Apple will use about a third of the output as production gets underway, it added.

The report said in addition to Apple, TSMC customers including Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) have also asked TSMC to make more sophisticated chips at the Arizona plant.

TSMC's customers have asked the company to roll out its latest technologies simultaneously in the United States and Taiwan, the report added.

TSMC declined to comment, while Apple, AMD and Nvidia did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

Last week, TSMC founder Morris Chang said the company was planning to produce chips with advanced 3-nanometre technology in Arizona, but added that the plans were not yet finalised. read more

618,213,APPLE,2022-12-01,Coinbase says Apple blocked its last app release on NFTs in wallet,"













Dec 1 (Reuters) - Coinbase Global Inc (COIN.O) said on Thursday customers using Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iOS will not be able to send non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the cryptocurrency exchange's wallet anymore.

""Apple's claim is that the gas fees required to send NFTs need to be paid through their In-App Purchase system, so that they can collect 30% of the gas fee,"" Coinbase Wallet added in a tweet.

Coinbase said it would not be able to comply with the requirement even if it tried as the iPhone maker's proprietary in-app purchase system does not support crypto.

""Apple has introduced new policies to protect their profits at the expense of consumer investment in NFTs and developer innovation across the crypto ecosystem,"" said Coinbase, adding the policy was similar to Apple trying to take a cut of fees for every email that gets sent over open internet protocols.

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the matter.

The 30% fees has been a contentious point between the world's most valuable company and other app developers like Spotify (SPOT.N) and ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games, which have accused the company of misusing its ""monopoly"".

Coinbase's issue with Apple comes at difficult time for the crypto exchange, whose shares are down roughly 80% so far this year. The company has also cut jobs to manage expenses as investors lose appetite for cryptocurrencies.

NFTs, which are digital assets that exist on the blockchain and carry unique digital signatures, exploded in popularity in 2021 but have seen demand crippled by the crypto winter in recent months.

Cryptocurrencies have been roiled as higher interest rates and worries of an economic downturn force investors to dump risky assets with the recent collapse of rival exchange FTX also piling pressure on the industry.

619,458,APPLE,2022-12-02,Nokia smartphone maker HMD Global files EU antitrust complaint against VoiceAge EVS,"













BRUSSELS, Dec 2 (Reuters) - HMD Global Oy, the exclusive licensee of Nokia-branded smartphones, has filed a complaint to EU antitrust regulators against VoiceAge EVS's patent practices and royalty rates.

Disputes over royalties have dogged the telecoms industry since the last decade. The most high profile were between Apple (AAPL.O) and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), and Apple versus Qualcomm (QCOM.O) which the companies eventually settled among themselves.

HMD and VoiceAge EVS (VAEVS), which was set up in 2018 to license Canadian tech company VoiceAge Corp's enhanced voice services patent portfolio, are fighting in courts in Germany, the United States and Brazil over various patents for technology related to voice calls.

HMD took its grievance to the EU competition watchdog on Thursday, according to a statement on its website.

""HMD has now also filed competition law complaints against VAEVS before the European Commission in order to seek the authorities to intervene in issues such as over-standardization, requirements for open standards and apparent non-FRAND demands and behaviour,"" the company said.

FRAND refers to fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms and conditions for patents essential to a technical standard.

The EU competition watchdog said it had received the complaint and would assess it based on the standard procedures. VoiceAge EVS did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

""VAEVS' published purported programmatic royalty rates, as available on its website, exceed the average royalty rates actually collected globally by almost all far larger licensors at the average sales price of HMD smartphones,"" HMD said.

""VAEVS' demands and VAEVS' behaviour more broadly breaches against voluntary FRAND licensing commitments binding on VAEVS and made for the patents now owned by VAEVS. This causes continued harm to HMD and the consumers,"" the company said.

The European Commission typically takes several months to decide whether a complaint merits an investigation. Cases can take several years before a decision is issued.

Law firms Related documents Device maker copied wearable heart-monitoring technology -Apple

AliveCor said Apple infringed its heart-monitoring patents















(Reuters) - Apple Inc sued medical-device maker AliveCor Inc in San Francisco federal court on Friday, claiming AliveCor's wearable heart monitors violated its patent rights.

Apple's complaint follows lawsuits by AliveCor against the tech giant in federal court and at the U.S. International Trade Commission, which is currently deciding whether to ban imports of Apple Watches based on AliveCor's patent-infringement claims.

Apple said in Friday's complaint that AliveCor filed the lawsuits in response to ""its own failures in the market,"" and said it wants to ""set the record straight as to who is the real pioneer"" of the technology.

An ITC judge ruled for AliveCor in a preliminary decision in June, and the commission's final ruling on the import ban is due Dec. 12. In a statement on Monday, AliveCor called the new lawsuit ""a desperate last-ditch effort by Apple to bully AliveCor into submission just days before the ITC decision.""

Representatives for Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.

AliveCor sued Apple in West Texas in 2020 and at the ITC last year for infringing patents related to AliveCor's KardiaBand, an Apple Watch accessory that monitors a user's heart rate, detects irregularities, and performs an electrocardiogram (ECG) to identify potential heart issues like atrial fibrillation.

Mountain View, California-based AliveCor stopped selling the KardiaBand in 2018 after Apple launched its own ECG feature. AliveCor said Apple copied its technology starting in Series 4 Apple Watches.

AliveCor also sued Apple last year in California for allegedly monopolizing the U.S. market for Apple Watch heart-rate monitoring apps, in a case that is still ongoing.

Apple's new lawsuit said AliveCor's devices copied Apple advancements related to heart-rate sensors in electronic devices, health-data aggregation, and other personal-health innovations. Apple said it developed its technology as early as 2008, two years before AliveCor was founded.

""AliveCor's litigation campaign is nothing more than an attempt to siphon from the success of Apple technologies it did not invent, all the while selling products that rely on foundational ECG innovations that Apple patented years before AliveCor came to be,"" Apple said.

Apple asked the court for money damages and an order blocking sales of infringing AliveCor products.

The case is Apple Inc v. AliveCor Inc, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 5:22-cv-07608.

621,611,APPLE,2022-12-05,Foxconn sees COVID-hit China plant back at full output in late Dec-early Jan -source,"













TAIPEI, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Apple supplier Foxconn (2317.TW) expects its COVID-hit Zhengzhou plant in China to resume full production around late December to early January, a Foxconn source said on Monday, after worker unrest last month disrupted the world's biggest iPhone factory.

The world's largest contract electronics maker later on Monday said revenue in November fell 11.4% year on year reflecting production problems related to COVID-19 controls at the major iPhone factory.

""At present, the overall epidemic situation has been brought under control with November being the most affected period,"" the company said in a statement, adding it has started to recruit new employees and was gradually ""restoring production capacity to normal"".

Foxconn said November revenue for its smart consumer electronics business, which includes smartphones, declined year on year partly due to a portion of shipments being impacted by production disruptions in Zhengzhou. It did not elaborate.

Reuters Graphics

The Zhengzhou plant has been grappling with strict COVID-19 restrictions that have fuelled discontent among workers over conditions at the factory. Production of the Apple (AAPL.O) device was disrupted ahead of Christmas and January's Lunar New Year holidays, with many workers either having to isolate to combat the spread of the virus or fleeing the plant.

Following the November unrest, that saw workers clash with security personnel, Foxconn could have seen more than 30% of the Zhengzhou site's November production affected, Reuters reported last month citing a source familiar with the matter. Foxconn hasn't disclosed details of the impact of the disruption on its production plans or finances.

Analysts say Foxconn assembles around 70% of iPhones, and the Zhengzhou plant produces the majority of its premium models including iPhone 14 Pro.

""The capacity is now being gradually resumed"" with new staff hiring under way, said the person with direct knowledge of the matter. The person declined to the named as the information was private.

""If the recruitment goes smoothly, it could take around three to four weeks to resume full production,"" the person said, pointing to a period around late December to early January.

Foxconn and the local government are working hard on the recruitment drive but many uncertainties remain, according to the source. The person cited ""fears"" some workers might have about working for the company after the plant was hit by protests last month that sometimes turned violent.

""We are firing on all cylinders on the recruitment,"" the person said.

Foxconn declined to comment.

A second Foxconn source familiar with the matter said the company is hoping to resume full production ""as soon as possible"" but was not able to give a timeline.

""The situation has stabilised,"" the person said, referring to the protests and the government's easing of COVID restrictions. ""The local government is actively helping with the resumption.""

The Taiwanese company said last month it expects a slight decline in fourth-quarter revenues year-on-year for its smart consumer electronics business and significant growth for cloud and network products.

Foxconn said on Monday its overall revenue in the fourth quarter was expected to be ""roughly in line with market consensus"", without elaborating. It did not offer a fresh outlook for its various business sectors.

The company said last month that revenue in the final three months of this year would be flattish, and that it has a relatively conservative outlook for 2023. read more

Exports median forecast -6.7% y/y (prior month -0.5%)

Imports median forecast +0.6% y/y (prior month +8.2%)

Balance median forecast $3.2 bln (prior month $2.99 bln)

CPI median forecast +2.5% y/y (prior month +2.72%)















TAIPEI, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Taiwan's exports likely dropped in November for the third month in a row and at a much sharper pace, amid fears of a global recession, uncertainties due to the war in Ukraine, and COVID-19 flare-ups in China, according to a Reuters poll.

Taiwan, a global hub for chip production and a key supplier to Apple Inc (AAPL.O), is one of Asia's leading exporters of technology goods. The trade data is seen as an important gauge of world demand for tech gadgets.

Exports last month were estimated to have dropped 6.7% from a year earlier, a Reuters poll of 16 analysts showed on Monday, faster than the 0.5% contraction in October.

The export forecasts varied widely, suggesting a contraction of between 0.67% and 10.7%, reflecting uncertainties over the global economy, supply chain disruptions due to pandemic lockdowns and power shortages in China, as well as the fallout of Russia and Ukraine war.

Taiwan's finance ministry had predicted November exports could contract in a range of 5% to 8% from a year earlier.

Separately, the consumer price index was expected to have risen 2.5% in November from a year earlier, slower than the 2.72% in October, according to the poll.

The inflation data will be released on Tuesday followed by the trade data on Wednesday.

623,76,APPLE,2022-12-05,MercadoLibre files complaints against Apple for 'anti-competitive practices',"













SAO PAULO, Dec 5 (Reuters) - E-commerce giant MercadoLibre Inc (MELI.O) said on Monday it has filed complaints against Apple Inc (AAPL.O) with antitrust regulators in Brazil and Mexico for anti-competitive practices, accusing the U.S.-based firm of abusing what it called a monopoly in the distribution of apps for its devices.

In a statement, the e-commerce giant said that Apple had imposed a series of restrictions on the distribution of digital goods and in-app purchases, including banning apps from distributing third-party digital goods and services such as movies, music, video games, books and written content.

In the complaint, the South American company criticized the California tech giant for requiring developers who offer digital goods or services within apps to use Apple's own payment system and stopping them from redirecting buyers to their websites. ""This clearly harms its competitors, unless they are integrated digital giants themselves, who may even benefit from this artificial tilt towards integrated ecosystems,"" Jacobo Cohen Imach, senior vice president of legal and public affairs said in a statement. MercadoLibre said the complaints against Apple had been filed before Brazil's antitrust watchdog CADE and Mexico's Federal Telecommunications Institute and Federal Economic Competition Commission.

The regulators could not immediately be reached for comment. Asked if they would consider a similar move against Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O), MercadoLibre's antitrust director Paolo Franco Benedetti said in an interview that the company was not fully comfortable with Google's policies, but is focusing on the complaints against Apple right now. Benedetti said that Google's app store had less strict rules than Apple's.

Apple declined to comment in Brazil and did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment in the United States. Google did not have a comment on the matter.

Apple's policies have been challenged in nearly every corner of the world over the past few years.

In a U.S. court trial last year over similar allegations, a judge found that Apple had not violated antitrust law in part because its rules led to security benefits for users that outweighed any harm to appmakers.

But the ruling is being appealed, and a global resolution on the concerns appears distant. Nasdaq-listed MercadoLibre is one of Latin America's largest companies, with a market capitalization of $47.53 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Cohen Imach said the e-commerce giant tried ""unsuccessfully"" to negotiate with Apple. ""Undoubtedly, we would have preferred to avoid a conflict with the world's largest company; however, we are convinced that we are doing the right thing for the future of competition,"" he said.

Dec 6 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) co-Chief Executive Ted Sarandos on Tuesday said he has yet to see a path to profitability in live sports on the streaming service.

Sarandos said the economics of professional sports were built around the economics of television - and buying rights is expensive.

""We've not seen a profit path to renting big sports today,"" Sarandos told the UBS Global TMT conference.

Rival streaming services Apple TV+ and Amazon Prime Video have added live professional sports competitions, acquiring rights to major league soccer and the NFL's Thursday night games, respectively. NBCUniversal simultaneously streams via Peacock the Sunday Night Football games it broadcasts on television.

Sarandos said Netflix has been able to add subscribers without the lure of big sporting events, such as the Super Bowl. He said he is ""confident"" the service can double in size without streaming live sports, although he did not rule it out entirely.

""We're not anti-sports, we're just pro-profit,"" Sarandos said. ""We have yet to figure out how to do it.""

PHOENIX/WASHINGTON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Taiwan chipmaker TSMC (2330.TW) plans to build a second chip plant in Arizona and more than triple its initial investment to $40 billion, estimating on Tuesday annual revenue of $10 billion from the plants when they are up and running.

The foreign investment by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's biggest chip contract manufacturer, is one of the largest in U.S. history.

The first chip fabrication facility, or fab, will be operational by 2024 while the second facility nearby will make the most advanced chips currently in production, called ""3 nanometer,"" by 2026.

U.S. President Joe Biden and others, including the CEOs of major TSMC customers, attended an opening ceremony for the new $12 billion facility in an arid and barren part of northern Phoenix.

""When completed with both fabs, we will manufacture over 600,000 wafers a year, representing $10 billion in yearly revenue,"" said TSMC Chairman Mark Liu, adding that customers using those chips would have annual sales of over $40 billion. read more A wafer is the shiny disc that chips are made on.

Liu said the two plants will create 13,000 high-paying tech jobs, including 4,500 under TSMC and the rest filled by suppliers.

Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O), all major TSMC customers, said they expected their chips to be made in the new Arizona plants.

""We work with TSMC to manufacture the chips that help power our products all over the world. And we look forward to expanding this work in the years to come as TSMC forms new and deeper roots in America,"" said Apple CEO Tim Cook.

""AMD expects to be a big customer, of both fabs and we're committed to working closely with TSMC and the entire ecosystem,"" said AMD CEO Lisa Su.

At least a dozen major cranes are still set up around the first factory which is dubbed Fab 21.

Against the background of the new factory draped with an American flag and a banner reading ""A Future Made in America Phoenix, AZ,"" top executives led by TSMC founder Morris Chang, 91, toasted the factory opening with sparkling wine.

Nearly 600 engineers hired in Arizona have been sent to Taiwan for training, Chang said. ""This is a very good sign that my dream of 25 years ago will now be fulfilled,"" he said of his wish to build fabs in the United States.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson















LONDON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Tony Fadell, a well-known Silicon Valley executive known as the father of the iPod, on Tuesday unveiled his latest project - a hardware wallet used to store cryptocurrency offline.

Fadell, 53, spent almost a decade at Apple (AAPL.O) under Steve Jobs, where he oversaw the design of the portable music player, and later helped create the company's best-known device, the iPhone.

After quitting Apple in 2008, he launched Nest Labs, a smart home-devices company. Nest was later acquired by tech giant Google for $3.2 billion.

Now Fadell has teamed up with Ledger, the French technology firm, to design a new offline cryptocurrency wallet.

Trading crypto requires the use of complex cryptographic keys, which are used to authorise transactions. These keys are typically stored online, for example with an online exchange, which can leave them more susceptible to hacking or theft.

The recent collapse of crypto exchange FTX, which has seen more than $1 billion of customer funds vanish, prompted an unprecedented surge in demand for offline, or ""self-custody"", services such as Ledger.

Previous models released by Ledger, such as the Nano S and Nano S, have been shaped like USB memory sticks. Fadell's new design, the Ledger Stax, is a credit-card sized device featuring a curved spine and electronic-ink display.

""All of the secure hardware up to this point was like all the MP3 players before the iPod, and it was time for an iPod,"" Ian Rogers, chief experience officer at Ledger, told Reuters.

Fadell had previously expressed scepticism of some elements of ""Web 3.0,"" a catch-all term encompassing a host of next-generation decentralised technologies, including cryptocurrency and the metaverse.

The Ledger Stax will sell for $279 online from early 2023.

628,200,APPLE,2022-12-06,Apple is sued by women who say AirTag lets stalkers track victims,"Companies Apple Inc Follow















Dec 6 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has been sued by two women who said its AirTag devices have made it easier for their former partners and other stalkers to track down victims.

In a proposed class action filed on Monday in San Francisco federal court, the women said Apple has been unable to protect people from unwanted trafficking through AirTag since launching what it called the ""stalker proof"" device in April 2021.

Starting at $29, AirTags are 1-1/4 inches (3.2 cm) in diameter, and intended to be slipped into or attached to keys, wallets, backpacks and other items so people can find them when they are lost.

But privacy experts and law enforcement have said some people use Airtags for criminal or malicious purposes.

The plaintiffs called AirTag ""the weapon of choice of stalkers and abusers,"" and said it has been linked to murders this year of women from Akron, Ohio and Indianapolis.

Monday's lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for U.S. owners of iOS or Android-based devices who were tracked by AirTag or are ""at risk"" of being stalked because of Apple's alleged negligence.

Apple did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment.

The Cupertino, California-based company has acknowledged that ""bad actors"" have tried misusing Airtags.

In February, Apple announced planned upgrades to make it easier to find the devices, and warn users faster that unknown AirTags might be ""traveling with them.""

One plaintiff in Monday's lawsuit, Lauren Hughes, said her former boyfriend learned where she had moved to avoid him after placing an AirTag in her car's wheel well.

She said he later posted a photo online of a taco truck from her new neighborhood, and included a winking emoji with the hashtag ""#airt2.0.""

The other plaintiff, Jane Doe, said her estranged husband tracked her after putting an AirTag in their child's backpack.

The case is Hughes et al v. Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-07668.

Dec 6 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has scaled back ambitious self-driving plans for its future electric vehicle and postponed the car's target launch date to 2026, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

The iPhone maker's shares fell 2.4% following the report.

The report added that the company plans to develop a vehicle that lets drivers conduct other tasks on a freeway and be alerted with ample time to switch over to manual control.

Last year, a Bloomberg report said Apple was pushing to launch its electric car as early as 2025 and refocusing the project around full self-driving capabilities.

Apple's ideal car would have no steering wheel and pedals, with interiors designed around hands-off driving, the report then said.

Appeals court affirms dismissal of allegations















(Reuters) - Apple Inc persuaded an appeals court on Tuesday to reject a U.S. patent and antitrust lawsuit by email app maker Blix Inc that accused the tech giant of copying Blix's technology for its single sign-on (SSO) system and stifling competition.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed without comment a Delaware federal court's decision to dismiss the case last year.

Representatives for the companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Blix's 2019 lawsuit said Apple had copied patented features of its BlueMail app in ""Sign In With Apple,"" which allows users to sign in to third-party applications and websites with Apple IDs.

Blix also accused Apple of violating antitrust law by forcing app developers that offer a third-party SSO to also offer ""Sign In With Apple"" and using monopoly power to build a ""moat"" around its user base by making it difficult and expensive to leave its iOS operating system.

U.S. District Judge Leonard Stark dismissed Blix's allegations last year, invalidating Blix's patent and finding the company did not explain how Apple was ""eliminating competition in any market.""

Blix had argued on appeal that Stark disregarded an ""entire pattern of anticompetitive conduct"" from Apple, including what Blix called Apple's ""hostile"" actions toward it and its alleged practice of ""Sherlocking,"" using its third-party app review process to steal developers' ideas.

The case is Blix Inc v. Apple Inc, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, No. 21-2203.

PHOENIX, Ariz., Dec 6 (Reuters) - Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC (2330.TW) on Tuesday said it would more than triple its planned investment at its new Arizona plant to $40 billion, among the largest foreign investments in U.S. history, as President Joe Biden visited and hailed the project.

The expanded investment is a big win for Biden after supply chain issues disrupted the U.S. economy early in his presidency.

""American manufacturing is back, folks,"" Biden said in a speech against the backdrop of the new factory draped with an American flag and a large banner reading ""A Future Made in America Phoenix, AZ.""

Biden's recent trip to Asia convinced him the United States is in a better position to lead the world economy in the years ahead ""if we keep our focus,"" he said.

Mark Liu, chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, known as TSMC, estimated annual revenue of $10 billion when the two planned chip fabrication plants open, adding that customers would have annual sales of $40 billion from products using chips made there. read more

Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O), all major TSMC customers, said they expected their chips to be made in the new plants.

""We work with TSMC to manufacture the chips that help power our products all over the world. And we look forward to expanding this work in the years to come as TSMC forms new and deeper roots in America,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a speech.

Also joining Biden at the facility's opening ceremony was TSMC founder Morris Chang, chipmaker Micron Technology Inc (MU.O) CEO Sanjay Mehrotra and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, among others.

The plant, scheduled to be operational in 2024, will make a more advanced chip than initially announced.

TSMC's Taipei-listed shares were flat in early trade on Wednesday following the announcement, tracking the broader market (.TWII).

TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is a leading supplier to major U.S. hardware manufacturers. Its $40 billion funding for the two facilities is the company's largest investment outside of Taiwan.

""Bringing TSMC's investment to the United States is a masterstroke and a game-changing development for the industry,"" Nvidia's Huang said in remarks prepared for Tuesday's event.

TSMC's expanded investment in Arizona is the latest in a string of major investments announced by chipmakers since the CHIPS and Science Act passed this summer. These include International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), Micron Technology Inc (MU.O) and Wolfspeed Inc (WOLF.N).

TSMC said it would build a second facility nearby to produce so-called ""3 nanometer"" chips by 2026, the most advanced currently in production.

TSMC also said it was planning to build an industrial water reclamation plant. Chip making is a water-intensive process, and Arizona, which is largely desert, is increasingly struggling with water shortages.

TSMC's Liu said its Phoenix factories are expected to create 13,000 high-tech jobs, including 4,500 under TSMC and the rest filled by suppliers.

Biden has sought to boost semiconductor production after the pandemic caused supply chain problems that led to shortages of chips for vehicles and many other items.

U.S. semiconductor production accounts for just 12% of the global total, down from 37% two decades ago, said a White House report on supply chain problems last year.

Taiwan's dominant position as a maker of chips used in technology from cellphones and cars to fighter jets has sparked concerns of over-reliance on the island, especially as China ramps up military pressure to assert its sovereignty claims.

China claims Taiwan as its territory but the democratically elected government in Taipei rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims.

The $52.7 billion Chips and Science Act, signed into law by Biden in August, is aimed at preventing a resurgence of supply chain woes.

Biden's trip to Arizona marks ""a significant milestone that TSMC is reaching in bringing the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S.,"" said Brian Deese, director of the White House National Economic Council.

Biden's victory in Arizona in the 2020 presidential election helped catapult him to the White House. Republican Donald Trump had won the state in 2016.

Biden has said he intends to seek a second four-year term in 2024.

Dec 6 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) recently considered building a ""super app"" that could include shopping, messaging, news and web search services among others, The Information reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The Windows-maker mulled building the app to loosen the hold of Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on the mobile search space, according to the report.

Microsoft executives wanted the app to also boost the company's multibillion-dollar advertising business and Bing search, as well as draw more users to Teams messaging and other mobile services, The Information reported

Microsoft did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

A super app, made popular in Asia by Tencent Holdings' (0700.HK) WeChat and South east Asia's Grab Holdings (GRAB.O), has been described as the Swiss army knife of mobile apps, offering a suite of services for users such as messaging, social networking, peer-to-peer payments and e-commerce shopping.

Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk, who also owns Twitter, has shown interest in building a super app named ""X"" that would combine a multitude of services.

The report added that it isn't clear whether the company would launch such an app, but Chief Executive Satya Nadella has pushed for the Bing search service to perform better with the Teams and Outlook.

PARIS, Dec 7 (Reuters) - A French environmental campaign group filed a complaint against Apple Inc. (AAPL.O) over commercial practices restricting the use of spare parts for repairs, it said on Wednesday.

""In many of the cases documented in the complaint, malfunctions are found in cases where the device is repaired with a part, even an identical and original part, not authorised by Apple's software,"" the HOP association said in a statement.

This would compromise the possibilities to repair or refurbish some products, including iPhone smartphones, the group said.

Apple France was not immediately available to comment.

In a similar case brought before the French consumer watchdog by the group in 2020, Apple agreed to pay 25 million euros ($26.32 million) for failing to inform iPhone users that updates of the operating system could slow down the functioning of the device.

Under French law, it is forbidden to deliberately reduce the lifespan of a product in order to increase its replacement rate.

PTO tribunal finds patents invalid week before scheduled ITC decision on ban















(Reuters) - A U.S. Patent and Trademark Office tribunal ruled Tuesday that three patents owned by medical-device maker AliveCor Inc are invalid, boosting Apple Inc's defense against a potential import ban on Apple Watches in a separate but related dispute.

The Patent Trial and Appeal Board canceled the AliveCor patents at Apple's request based on earlier publications that it said disclosed the same innovations in wearable heart monitoring.

The U.S. International Trade Commission in June had ruled in a preliminary decision that the Apple Watch's heart-monitoring capabilities infringe two of the patents. The commission could ban imports of infringing Apple Watches if it affirms the ruling.

The ITC's target date for its final decision is Dec. 12.

AliveCor said in a statement Wednesday that it was ""deeply disappointed"" by Tuesday's decision and will appeal it, but looks forward to the ITC's separate determination.

Apple said in a statement Tuesday that it appreciates the board's ""careful consideration"" of the patents, and that the decision ""confirms that the patents AliveCor asserted in the ITC against Apple are invalid.""

AliveCor sued Apple in West Texas in 2020 and at the ITC last year for infringing the patents related to AliveCor's KardiaBand, an Apple Watch accessory that monitors a user's heart rate, detects irregularities, and performs an electrocardiogram (ECG) to identify potential heart issues like atrial fibrillation.

Mountain View, California-based AliveCor stopped selling the KardiaBand in 2018 after Apple launched its own ECG feature. AliveCor said Apple copied its technology starting in Series 4 Apple Watches, and separately sued Apple last year in California for allegedly monopolizing the U.S. market for Apple Watch heart-monitoring apps.

Apple went on the offensive against AliveCor recently, suing the company in San Francisco federal court on Dec. 2 for allegedly infringing patents related to heart-rate sensors in electronic devices and other personal-health technology.

The cases are Apple Inc v. AliveCor Inc, Patent Trial and Appeal Board, IPR2021-00970, -00971, and -00972.

636,129,APPLE,2022-12-07,"Apple offers hacking targets new options to secure data, chats","













OAKLAND, Calif., Dec 7 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) plans to allow users to more tightly lock down photos and notes stored on its iCloud service and require a physical security key when logging in from a new device, it said on Wednesday.

The forthcoming options, along with another security measure for Apple's iMessage chat program, are particularly aimed at celebrities, journalists, activists, politicians and other high-profile individuals heavily targeted by hackers, the company said.

The iPhone maker said that though it was not aware of breaches to iCloud servers or iMessage exchanges, hacking attempts are increasing.

U.S. users will be able to activate the free Advanced Data Protection for iCloud storage by the end of the year. When turned on, Apple cannot help users recover photos, notes, voice memos and about 20 other types of data if they forget their password. It will expand globally next year.

The option to require plugging a security fob into a new device to access an Apple account is expected to roll out next year. Rival Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google already supports such hardware keys, which are certified by industry body FIDO and cost about $25.

On iMessage, conversations between users who enable the new Contact Key Verification next year would receive automated alerts about unrecognized devices potentially snooping on the exchange. Users can manually verify their communication is secure by matching up security codes, too. Secure chat services such as Signal offer comparable features.

637,811,APPLE,2022-12-08,Meta battles U.S. antitrust agency over future of virtual reality,"













SAN JOSE, Calif./ WASHINGTON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - The Biden administration on Thursday accused Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) of trying to buy its way to dominance in the metaverse, kicking off a high-profile trial to try to prevent the Facebook parent from buying virtual reality app developer Within Inc.

The FTC sued in July to stop the deal, saying Meta's acquisition of Within would ""tend to create a monopoly"" in the market for virtual reality (VR) fitness apps. It has asked the judge to order a preliminary injunction that would halt the proposed transaction.

In an opening statement, FTC lawyer Abby Dennis said the Within acquisition was part of Meta's bid to acquire new and more diverse virtual reality users, including customers of Within's popular subscription-based virtual reality workout app Supernatural.

That would complement Meta's existing virtual reality users, who tend to skew young and male, and be more focused on gaming, Dennis added.

""Meta could have chosen to use all its vast resources and capabilities to build its own dedicated VR fitness app, and it was planning on doing that before it acquired Within,"" Dennis said, pointing to a plan from early 2021.

The plan, Operation Twinkie, involved expanding a rhythm game app called Beat Saber that the company acquired in 2019 into the fitness space via a proposed partnership with digital fitness company Peloton (PTON.O), Dennis said.

She cited an email from Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg saying he was ""bullish"" on fitness and calling the proposed partnership with Peloton ""awesome.""

Lawyers for Meta and Within argued that the FTC did a poor job of defining the relevant market and said the companies compete with a range of fitness content, not just VR-dedicated fitness apps.

Meta's lawyers also disputed that plans for a Meta-owned VR fitness app had proceeded beyond low-level ""brainstorming"" and argued that the FTC underestimated the competition in the market it had defined, citing the potential for fellow tech giants Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Bytedance to join the fray.

Rade Stojsavljevic, who manages Meta's in-house VR app developer studios, testified that he had proposed the tie-up between Beat Saber and Peloton but did not develop a formal plan and never discussed the idea with either party.

Internal documents from early 2021 that were displayed in court showed Stojsavljevic proposing acquisitions of VR developers before they could be ""cannibalized"" by competitors and discussing pressure from Zuckerberg to ""get aggressive"" in response to reports of a prospective Apple headset.

The trial, scheduled through Dec. 20, will serve as a test of the FTC's bid to head off what it sees as a repeat of the company acquiring small upcoming would-be rivals and effectively buying its way to dominance, this time in the nascent virtual and augmented reality markets.

The FTC is separately trying to force Meta to unwind two previous acquisitions, Instagram and WhatsApp, in a lawsuit filed in 2020. Both were in relatively new markets at the time the companies were purchased.

PRESSURE TO PRODUCE HIT APPS

A government victory could crimp Meta's ability to maneuver in an area of emerging technology - virtual and augmented reality - that Zuckerberg has identified as the ""next generation of computing.""

If blocked from making acquisitions in the space, Meta would face greater pressure to produce its own hit apps and would give up the gains - in terms of revenue, talent, data and control - associated with bringing innovative developers in-house.

Within developed Supernatural, which it advertises as a ""complete fitness service"" with ""expert coaches,"" ""beautiful destinations"" and ""workouts choreographed to the best music available.""

It is available only on Meta's Quest devices, which are headsets offering immersive digital visuals and audio that market research firm IDC estimates capture 90% of global shipments in the virtual reality hardware market.

The majority of the more than 400 apps available in the Quest app store are produced by external developers. Meta owns the most popular virtual reality app in the Quest app store, Beat Saber, the app it was considering expanding with the Peloton partnership.

The social media company agreed to buy Within in October 2021, a day after changing its name from Facebook to Meta, signalling its ambition to build an immersive virtual environment known as the metaverse.

Zuckerberg will be a witness in the trial. Other potential witnesses are Within CEO Chris Milk and Meta Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth, who runs the company's metaverse-oriented Reality Labs unit.

The trial is at the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

LONDON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - HONG KONG, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Apple supplier Foxconn's (2317.TW) COVID-hit Zhengzhou facility in China has lifted its ""closed-loop"" management curbs on Thursday, it said in a statement posted on its WeChat account.

The Zhengzhou industrial park where Foxconn's plant locates has been under a so-called closed-loop system that isolated the plant from the wider world for 56 days, the statement said.

The world's largest contract electronics maker, which has been trying to replenish depleted staff numbers at the site after thousands left over the past month, expects the Zhengzhou plant to resume full production around late December to early January, a company source told Reuters on Monday.

Its Zhengzhou plant was in October hit by a COVID-19 outbreak that prompted it to impose tough restrictions that involved isolating many staff. This in turn fueled fear and discontent among workers and caused many to have to isolate or flee. Later in November, it was hit by a fresh bout of worker unrest that saw staff clash with security personnel over bonus payment issues.

Foxconn could have seen more than 30% of the Zhengzhou site's November production affected, Reuters reported last month citing a source familiar with the matter. Foxconn hasn't disclosed details of the impact of the disruption on its production plans or finances, which took place during a traditionally busy period for Apple (AAPL.O) ahead of Christmas and January's Lunar New Year holidays.

The company's November revenue fell 11.4% year on year reflecting production problems related to COVID controls at the major iPhone factory.

Dec 7 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc plans to change the pricing of its Twitter Blue subscription product to $11, from $7.99, if paid for through its iPhone app and to $7 if paid for on the website, the Information reported on Wednesday, citing a person briefed on the plans.

The move was likely a pushback against Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) 30% cut on any payments made by users via apps on the iOS operating system, the report said.

The lower pricing on the website was also likely to drive more users to that platform as opposed to signing up on their iPhones, the report said. It did not mention whether pricing would change for the Android platform as well.

Musk, who took ownership of Twitter in October, is planning to roll out the micro blogging site's verified service with different colored checks for individuals, companies and governments, after a botched initial launch led to a surge in users impersonating celebrities and brands on the platform.

Twitter, Apple and Google, which owns the Android operating system, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Musk, in a series of tweets last week listed various grievances with Apple, including the 30% fee the iphone maker charges software developers for in-app purchases.

He also posted a meme suggesting he was willing to ""go to war"" with Apple rather than paying the commission. read more

Dec 8 (Reuters) - Apple supplier Foxconn's (2317.TW) founder Terry Gou had warned China that the government's zero-COVID stance would threaten the position of the world's second-largest economy in the global supply chain, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The appeal, sent by Gou in a letter more than a month ago, played a major role in convincing China's leadership to quickly reopen the economy and move away from its zero-tolerance COVID-19 policy, the report said on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Gou's office said in a statement that it ""sternly denies"" the facts in the report. Foxconn, which is the biggest assembler of iPhones, declined to comment, while China's State Council Information Office could not be immediately reached for comment.

Gou retired from Foxconn in 2019 and has no formal role within the company any more, though remains influential.

The Taiwan-based company's Zhengzhou plant, which saw a month-long unrest in November, has lifted its ""closed-loop"" management curbs on Thursday.

The Zhengzhou plant had been grappling with strict COVID restrictions that fuelled discontent among workers over factory conditions, triggering an 11.4% year-on-year drop in November revenue.

Some Wall Street analysts cut their iPhone shipment targets for the all-important holiday quarter as a result of turmoil at the major iPhone factory.

Chinese health officials and government advisers seized on Gou's letter to bolster the case that the government needed to speed up its efforts to ease its tough COVID-19 controls, the report added.

The announcement of a $500 million injection into its India unit comes after Reuters reported last month that Apple supplier Foxconn plans to quadruple the workforce at its iPhone factory in India over two years, with two government officials with knowledge of the matter pointing to a production adjustment as it faces disruptions in China.

Foxconn plans to boost the workforce at its plant in southern India to 70,000 by adding 53,000 more workers over the next two years, sources had said.

The company shared its plans with Tamil Nadu officials about accelerating its hiring efforts at the Indian plant due to disruptions in China, according to a government source, while a person in Taiwan with knowledge of the matter said Foxconn was expanding its operations in India to increase its capacity for basic models and to meet Indian demand.

Formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, Foxconn opened the India plant in 2019 and has been ramping up production. It began producing the iPhone 14 this year.

Foxconn, which grabbed headlines in recent weeks for imposing tough COVID-19 restrictions at its Zhengzhou plant in China which resulted in worker unrest, said on Thursday the facility has lifted its ""closed-loop"" management curbs.

Dec 8 (Reuters) - Broadcom Inc (AVGO.O) forecast current-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates on Thursday, signaling strong demand for chips used in data centers and networking equipment.

Companies are increasingly investing in the infrastructure needed to support a switch to hybrid work models, giving Broadcom - which makes chips for data centers, routers and Wi-Fi modems - an edge over competitors with more exposure to smartphones and PCs.

Broadcom, which counts iPhone maker Apple Inc (AAPL.O) as a major customer, also stands to gain from the global rollout of 5G and its foray into the lucrative software arena.

Shares in Broadcom, which are down over 20% this year, rose 3% in extended trading.

The company forecast first-quarter revenue of about $8.9 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $8.78 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Revenue rose 21% to $8.93 billion in the fourth quarter ended Oct. 30. Analysts on average had expected $8.90 billion. Semiconductor revenue grew 26%, as supply chain constraints eased.

On an adjusted basis, the company earned $10.45 per share, surpassing estimates of $10.28.

STOCKHOLM, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Ericsson (ERICb.ST) said on Friday it had struck a global patent licence agreement with Apple (AAPL.O), ending a row over royalty payments for the use of 5G wireless patents in iPhones.

The Swedish telecoms equipment maker said the multi-year deal included global cross-licences for patented cellular standard-essential technologies, and granted certain other patent rights.

""The settlement ends all ongoing patent-related legal disputes between the parties,"" it said in a statement.

The deal comes after Ericsson in January filed a second set of patent infringement lawsuits against the U.S. maker of iPhones.

Both companies had already sued each other in the United States as negotiations failed over the renewal of a seven-year licensing contract for telecoms patents first struck in 2015.

Ericsson sued first in October 2021, claiming that Apple was trying to improperly cut down the royalty rates. The iPhone maker then filed a lawsuit in December 2021, accusing the Swedish company of using ""strong-arm tactics"" to renew patents.

Ericsson on Friday forecast fourth-quarter intellectual property rights (IPR) licensing revenues of 5.5 billion-5.0 billion Swedish crowns ($530.3 million-$578.5 million) including the effects of the settlement, and including ongoing IPR business with all other licensees.

SYDNEY, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Hundreds of Apple workers in Australia are preparing to go on a strike ahead of Christmas to demand better working conditions and wages, union leaders and staff said, a move likely to hurt the iPhone maker's sales and services in the country.

The less than two-day strike by about 200 of Apple's roughly 4,000 employees in Australia comes as the U.S. tech giant faces disruptions due to worker unrest in its main iPhone plant in China. read more

Members of Australia's Retail and Fast Food Workers Union (RAFFWU) are asking Apple Inc (AAPL.O) for fixed rosters, known hours of work, weekends of two consecutive days and an agreed annual wage rise.

""This Christmas strike is a way for our members to take back their time with family and friends while management continues to refuse to give workers the most basic minimum rostering rights,"" RAFFWU secretary Josh Cullinan told Reuters, adding management would be notified on Monday of the intention to strike.

Efforts to get management to the bargaining table immediately failed earlier this week, with Apple (AAPL.O) refusing to meet until February, he said.

Striking workers would walk out of Apple's retail outlets at 3 p.m. (0400 GMT) on Dec. 23 and stay away throughout Christmas Eve, usually a peak time for sales of Apple iPhones, watches and other products.

The action would be nationwide but would have the greatest impact at two retail outlets in Brisbane, and one each in Adelaide and Newcastle where RAFFWU have the most members.

An Apple spokesperson declined to comment on the negotiations but said the company was ""proud to reward our valued team members in Australia with strong compensation and exceptional benefits”.

In June this year Apple workers in Maryland became the first retail employees of the tech giant to unionise in the United States. On Thursday, the union set formal dates in January to start negotiations with Apple.

Apple workers staged a full day strike in October and also a one-hour walkout later that month. read more

""You cant put a price on work-life balance,"" said one Apple employee, who will join the strike but did not want to be identified over fears of being targeted by management.

""What we have ended up with Apple is an arrangement where all the non-mandatory benefits that allows a work-life balance to workers have been taken off.""

Other strike actions that have been continuing from earlier this year will also be escalated, RAFFWU said, including a ban on iphone repair and Apple Watch repairs for certain hours in some outlets, bans on answering the door in others, bans on conducting any sales, and bans on wearing the company's festive red t-shirt.

646,780,APPLE,2022-12-12,Irish multinational jobs growth up 43% y/y as tech cuts begin,"Summary

Summary Companies Foreign companies employ 12% of entire workforce

Record job gain does not include many recent tech cuts

Companies will be ""much more cautious"" in 2023















DUBLIN, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Foreign-owned multinationals in Ireland added a record number of jobs in the year to end October, up 43% on last year's previous high as the state investment agency forecast slower growth for 2023 as some large tech companies let staff go.

Ireland is hugely reliant on foreign companies whose total number of employees have almost doubled in the last decade to 301,000, or 12% of the entire workforce. They also pay a large chunk of the country's income and corporate taxes.

A net job gain of just over 24,000 included 8,407 job losses, down on last year's 12,231.

IDA Ireland said this did not include many of the local layoffs tech firms including Facebook parent Meta (META.O), Twitter and Stripe have announced recently as part of global cutbacks.

IDA Ireland Interim CEO Mary Buckley said she expected that tech firms may cut some more jobs next year but that the sector would continue to grow in the future.

While a positive pipeline of investments are lined up across other sectors for the first half of 2023, the severe headwinds facing the global economy means companies are going to be ""much more cautious"" next year, Buckley added.

""So slower growth is likely in 2023 with less clarity in the second half of next year,"" she said.

Some of Ireland's largest multinational employers were among the 242 firms that added jobs, including Apple (AAPL.O), TikTok, Dell (DELL.N), IBM (IBM.N), Citi (C.N), Abbott (ABT.N), Pfizer (PFE.N) and Workday .

Almost half of the companies that created news jobs invested in Ireland for the first time.

647,571,APPLE,2022-12-12,China re-opens more areas at risk for COVID spread as lockdowns ease,"













BEIJING, Dec 12 (Reuters) - China has slashed the number of locations deemed at high risk of wider COVID outbreaks, re-opening locked down areas including one hosting a key factory of an Apple supplier.

The number of high-risk areas tumbled to around 4,500 on Monday, official data showed, down 85% from more than 30,000 on Dec. 7 before the latest policy shift was announced.

A district in the city of Zhengzhou in central China where iPhone supplier Foxconn (2317.TW) has a vast facility declared on Monday that it had released all high-risk zones from lockdown.

Last month, thousands of workers fled the Foxconn facility on fears of COVID lockdowns, curtailing production.

High-risk areas without new infections for five consecutive days should be released from lockdown, according to one of China's latest protocols released on Dec. 7.

Local authorities have also been warned not to arbitrarily expand the scope of lockdowns or prolong them.

Economists say the China's shift to live with COVID will reduce disruptive lockdowns that have dragged on the economy particularly this year because of the high transmissibility of the Omicron variant of the virus.

648,294,APPLE,2022-12-12,"Apple should face 6 mln euro fine, adviser to French privacy watchdog says","













PARIS, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) should face a 6 million euro ($6.3 million) fine for breach of privacy rules, the top adviser to French data protection authority's sanction body recommended on Monday.

CNIL's sanction body is free to ignore the rapporteur's recommendations, but these typically carry a lot of weight regarding the watchdog's final decision.

The rapporteur, Francois Pellegrini, made his recommendation after an investigation by the authority, itself triggered by a complaint filed last year by lobby group France Digitale.

In the complaint, the lobby, which represents the bulk of France's digital entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, alleged that iPhone maker Apple's former operating software, iOS 14, did not comply with EU privacy requirements.

France Digitale argued then that while iPhone owners were asked under iOS 14 whether they were ready to allow installed mobile apps to gather a key identifier used to define campaign ads and send targeted ads, default settings allowed Apple to carry its own targeted ad campaigns without clearly asking iPhone users for their prior consent.

Apple's privacy updates, called App Tracking Transparency, give users the option to block apps from tracking activity across apps and websites owned by other companies.

In his remarks, Pellegrini said Apple's previous operating system version iOS 14.6 failed to ask users properly for their prior consent for the collection of personal data, thus constituting a breach of privacy rules under the European Union's ePrivacy directive.

He added that changes made under a subsequent version of Apple's operating system, iOS 15, allowed for such prior consent.

Gary Davis, Apple's head of privacy, contested the rapporteur's conclusions at the hearing, saying the U.S. firm was committed to the protection of users' privacy.

""The absence of any seriousness to the breach ... means that the amount of the fine should be decreased,"" he said, requesting that the amount of any fine should not be made public.

CNIL's sanction body did not say when it would reach a decision.

649,115,APPLE,2022-12-12,India's Tata Group to open 100 exclusive Apple stores -report,"













Dec 12 (Reuters) - Indian salt-to-software conglomerate Tata Group plans to open 100 stores across the country that will only sell Apple Inc (AAPL.O) products, the Economic Times newspaper reported on Monday, citing two people aware of the matter.

Tata Group's Infiniti Retail, which runs the consumer electronics store chain Croma, will be an Apple-authorised reseller and set up stores at shopping malls, high-street and neighbourhood locations, the report said.

Tata has begun talks with premium malls and high streets and the lease terms include details of brands and stores that cannot be opened near these outlets, a retail consultant aware of the matter told the publication.

Apple and Tata Group did not immediately respond to Reuters' calls and emails seeking comment.

The latest development comes less than two weeks after the Economic Times reported that the Tata Group was in talks to buy Wistron Corp's (3231.TW) only manufacturing facility in India for up to 50 billion rupees ($605 million).

Tata and Taiwan's Wistron – one of Apple's top vendors in India – were in discussion to set up a joint venture to assemble iPhones in India, Bloomberg reported in September. ($1 = 82.6250 Indian rupees)

TOKYO, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) said on Tuesday it had invested more than $100 billion in its Japanese supply network over the last five years, as its Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook visited the epicentre of the country's semiconductor industry.

Cook said in a Monday tweet he visited Kumamoto prefecture in southwestern Japan, home to factories of many semiconductor and leading technology firms, including one under construction by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) (2330.TW).

In a statement, Apple said it had boosted its spending on suppliers in Japan by more than 30% since 2019, with a network spanning nearly 1,000 companies, from multi-nationals to family-run businesses.

It called Sony Group Corp (6758.T) one of its biggest suppliers in Japan for providing camera sensors for iPhone products, while also mentioning medium- and small enterprises including textile firm Inoue Ribbon Industry Co and mold manufacturer Shincron Co as partners.

Apple said 29 Japanese suppliers have committed to converting to renewable energy for Apple-related businesses by 2030, including Sony, Murata Manufacturing Co (6981.T), Keiwa Inc (4251.T), Fujikura (5803.T) and Sumitomo Electric Industries (5802.T).

652,226,APPLE,2022-12-13,Apple plans to let rival app stores on iPhones in EU -Bloomberg,"













Dec 13 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is preparing to allow alternative app stores on its iPhones and iPads in the European Union as soon as late next year to comply with a new European competition law it had fought, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.

Opening up to outside app stores could present a major threat to Apple's fast-growing services business, but rivals would first have to surmount the hurdle of convincing consumers to leave the security and simplicity of using Apple's own store.

The magnitude of consequences depends on how the U.S. company complies with additional mandates in the European law, known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA).

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and other companies with app stores could receive boosts to sales as a result of Apple's planned change on rival storefronts.

Apple declined to comment. Meta, Amazon and Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment but a coalition of app makers said Apple must fully comply with the DMA to truly open competition.

As part of the reportedly planned change, Apple customers could ultimately install apps without using the company's App Store. But Apple has not made decisions on whether to comply with other provisions of the law, such as allowing for alternative payment systems to its own.

Permitting its payment tool to be bypassed would threaten billions of dollars in revenue Apple collects from charging a commission of up to 30% on App Store purchases.

About $10 billion worth of transactions flowed through the App Store last year, according to estimates from Sensor Tower, a mobile analytics company. At least 70% of the funds go to app makers.

Angelo Zino, a stock analyst at CFRA, said he expects under 0.2% of Apple's total sales to be affected by competing app stores in Europe.

""The ultimate impact will be minimal as most consumers are creatures of habit and are very satisfied with the platform,"" he said. ""We expect a majority of consumers will keep the status quo by utilizing (Apple's) existing app store.""

Enforcement of the European Union's DMA is expected to begin in mid-2024. The law requires big tech companies to open their systems to competitors in hopes of increasing consumer choice. The big gatekeepers, as the law describes them, face fines of up to 10% of annual global revenue for violations.

The iPhone maker has said that allowing sideloading, bypassing its App Store, exposes users to security and privacy dangers. But some regulators and critics, such as ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games, have said those concerns are overblown.

Epic CEO Tim Sweeney tweeted Tuesday that U.S. Congress must pass proposed legislation similar to DMA, or it ""would leave American developers in serfdom.""

Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google has allowed sideloading on phones powered by its Android operating system for years. But to take advantage, users must adjust settings and swipe past security warnings, meaning 90% of downloads still come from Google's official app store, Epic has alleged in court.

Twitter earns nearly 90% of its revenue from selling digital ads and Musk recently attributed a ""massive drop in revenue"" to civil rights organizations that have pressured brands to pause their Twitter ads.

WASHINGTON, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Representative Jim Jordan, who will chair the House Judiciary Committee next Congress, gave a hint of what is to come with letters sent to five big tech companies requesting information about conservative material removed from their platforms.

In letters sent Tuesday and seen by Reuters, Jordan requested the top executives at Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Meta's Facebook provide any information they have about contact with President Joe Biden's administration regarding ""the moderation, deletion, suppression, restricting, or reduced circulation of content.""

Microsoft declined to comment. The other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Republicans won control of the House in the midterm elections, which will give them control of key committees in January with the power to investigate and even subpoena witnesses.

Jordan and other Republicans have argued that the companies stifle conservative voices, something that they have denied.

""House Republicans have written a number of prior letters to you in attempts to obtain relevant information. You have not provided responses that have satisfied our concerns,"" Jordan wrote in the letters. ""Committee Republicans will continue to pursue these matters, including into the 118th Congress if necessary.""

655,800,APPLE,2022-12-14,Tesla shares fall as investors bash Musk's Twitter focus,"













SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O) shares extended declines to hit their lowest level in more than two years on Wednesday, as investors including a ""fanboy"" of CEO Elon Musk lashed out at Musk's distraction from the electric car company following his buy of Twitter.

Shares of Tesla, the world's most valuable carmaker, is one of the worst performing stocks among major automakers and tech companies this year, as investors worry that Musk's Twitter buy could divert his time away from Tesla and he could offload more Tesla stocks to prop up the struggling social media company.

Investors are also increasingly concerned that his antics could hurt brand and sales of Tesla, the world's top electric carmaker which faces increasing competition.

""Elon abandoned Tesla and Tesla has no working CEO,"" KoGuan Leo, the third Largest individual shareholder of Tesla, who describes himself of Musk's ""fanboy,"" tweeted on Wednesday.

""Are we merely Elon’s foolish bag holders?"" he said. ""An executioner, Tim Cook-like is needed, not Elon.""

Tesla shares traded down 1.4%, after falling as much as 3.2% to $155.88 per share, the lowest level since November 18, 2020.

Tesla shares slumped 55% so far this year, lagging the performances of GM (GM.N), Ford (F.N), Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O).

Musk said on Tuesday that he “will make sure Tesla shareholders benefit from Twitter long-term,"" without elaborating.

Even Tesla bulls and loyal fans expressed discontent over Musk's controversial tweets.

""Elon is a brilliant business leader. He will realize soon (if not already) that his polarizing political views are hurting customer perceptions of $TSLA EVs,"" Gary Black, a Tesla bull, tweeted on Wednesday.

""Customers don’t want their cars to be controversial. They want to be proud as hell to drive them - not embarrassed.""

Goldman Sachs on Tuesday cut the price target for Tesla shares and lowered estimates for Tesla's deliveries and gross margins for the fourth quarter, reflecting softer supply and demand.

Baykar Technologies/Handout via REUTERS















ISTANBUL, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Turkish defence firm Baykar said its first jet-powered unmanned aerial combat vehicle (UCAV) completed its maiden flight on Wednesday, as the company continues to gain popularity globally, most recently by helping Ukraine's army fight Russian forces.

Baykar released a video showing the Kizilelma (Golden Apple) UCAV taking off and then returning to an airbase which it said was in the northwestern Corlu province, 85 kilometers west of Istanbul.

Flightradar data also showed an unknown aircraft with a BYK07 call sign detected over Corlu Airport on Wednesday.

The company's earlier Bayraktar TB2 drone has featured prominently in global conflicts, pushing Baykar into the global spotlight and transforming it into a major manufacturer and exporter.

International demand for Baykar's propeller-driven drones soared after their impact in Syria, Ukraine, and Libya, where their laser-guided armor-piercing bombs helped repel an offensive by UAE-supported forces two years ago.

Selcuk Bayraktar, Baykar's chief technology officer, said in the video that Kizilelma had successfully completed its maiden flight.

The UCAV will increase the top speed and carrying capacity of the existing drones in Turkey, which have also played a prominent role in conflicts in Libya and northern Iraq.

Turkey's new drone powered by a jet-engine shows similar exterior features to fifth generation fighter jets. Baykar says in addition to conventional drone missions, Kizilelma will be able to conduct air-to-air engagements.

Malaysia and Indonesia had expressed interest in buying armed drones from Turkey, while 20 of them have been delivered to the United Arab Emirates.

Baykar is planning to complete the construction of its manufacturing plant in Ukraine, the only one outside of Turkey, in two years.

After it got removed from the F-35 fighter jet program, Turkey converted its vertical take-off aircraft carrier, which is still under construction into a drone carrier. The carrier will serve as a base for Kizilema and other drones in use by the Turkish military.

657,137,APPLE,2022-12-15,"Australia takes aim at Apple, Microsoft over child protection online","













SYDNEY, Dec 15 (Reuters) - An Australian regulator, after using new powers to make the tech giants share information about their methods, accused Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) not doing enough to stop child exploitation content on their platforms.

The e-Safety Commissioner, an office set up to protect internet users, said that after sending legal demands for information to some of the world's biggest internet firms, the responses showed Apple and Microsoft did not proactively screen for child abuse material in their storage services, iCloud and OneDrive.

The two firms also confirmed they did not use any technology to detect live-streaming of child sexual abuse on video services Skype and Microsoft Teams, which are owned by Microsoft, and FaceTime, which is owned by Apple, the commissioner said in a report published on Thursday.

A Microsoft spokesperson said the company was committed to combatting proliferation of abuse material but ""as threats to children's safety continue to evolve and bad actors become more sophisticated in their tactics, we continue to challenge ourselves to adapt our response"".

Apple was not immediately available for comment.

The disclosure confirms gaps in the child protection measures of some of the world's biggest tech firms, building public pressure on them to do more, according to the commissioner. Meta Platforms Inc, (META.O) which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, and Snapchat owner Snap Inc (SNAP.N) also got demands for information.

The responses overall were ""alarming"" and raised concerns of ""clearly inadequate and inconsistent use of widely available technology to detect child abuse material and grooming"", commissioner Julie Inman Grant said in a statement.

Microsoft and Apple ""do not even attempt to proactively detect previously confirmed child abuse material"" on their storage services, although a Microsoft-developed detection product is used by law enforcement agencies.

An Apple announcement a week ago that it would stop scanning iCloud accounts for child abuse, following pressure from privacy advocates, was ""a major step backwards from their responsibilities to help keep children safe"" Inman Grant said.

The failure of both firms to detect live-streamed abuse amounted to ""some of the biggest and richest technology companies in the world turning a blind eye and failing to take appropriate steps to protect the most vulnerable from the most predatory"", she added.

Summary Companies Company to reach lower end of 15-18% EBITA range by 2024

Accelerating cost cuts of 9 bln SEK by end of next year















STOCKHOLM, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson (ERICb.ST) said on Thursday it was committed to reaching the lower end of its long-term target of a profit (EBITA) margin of 15-18% by 2024 as it outlined strategy to investors.

The company, one of the world's biggest suppliers of 5G technology, also said it was accelerating initiatives to cut costs by 9 billion crowns ($880 million) by the end of 2023 as it planned for a flat overall networks market.

Ericsson reported an EBITA margin of 11.2% for the third quarter as higher investment in technology, selling expenses and one-off costs weighed on profitability. Shares in the company were down 1.6% by 1413 GMT.

Last week, the Stockholm-based company announced it had struck a global deal with Apple (AAPL.O) to end a long-running legal battle over royalty payments over the use of 5G patents in iPhones that has dented profits and shares this year.

While demand for 5G equipment has been strong, the early stages of a rollouts tend to have lower margins, meaning telecom groups such as Ericsson and Finnish rival Nokia (NOKIA.HE) rely on patent royalties to boost profits.

Both of the Nordic companies have also been seeking to cut costs as they contend with lingering chip shortages and disruptions due to the war in Ukraine war, including their planned exits from the Russian market.

Ericsson forecast the 5G radio access network (RAN) market would see annual growth of 11% over the next three years while the overall market was seen flat.

""Ericsson is planning for a flat RAN market and is structuring its cost base and operations accordingly,"" it said.

659,146,APPLE,2022-12-16,App store avalanche forecast as Apple bows to EU demands,"













LONDON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Apple's rivals are positioning themselves as the go-to alternative to its dominant App Store as the iPhone maker prepares to allow others on its devices in the European Union.

The bloc's Digital Markets Act (DMA) will force Apple and fellow tech giant Google to provide space for third-party app stores on their respective iOS and Android devices.

Under the DMA, which comes into effect on a rolling basis over the next two years, third-party alternatives will have an easier route to getting onto iPhones and Android devices.

And as components of the legislation come into effect, rivals from smaller startups to giants like Amazon and Microsoft may try to lure consumers and app developers alike away from Apple and Google.

Ben Wood, CMO of industry analysis firm CCS Insight, said he expects ""an avalanche of app stores"" in the near future.

""There's an emerging 'coalition of the willing', and all of them have a vested interest in no longer having to pay what they see as a tax to Apple,"" Wood told Reuters.

Apple and Google did not respond to requests for comment.

Android users can at present install apps from alternative sources, a process known as ""sideloading"", but this often requires them to switch off certain security settings.

Apple's apparent concessions on sideloading mark a win for industry leaders such as Twitter owner Elon Musk and Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, both of whom have bemoaned the company's 30% surcharge on purchases made via its App Store.

Rivals are plotting to bring frustrated developers over to their stores, promising lower commission fees and the potential for exclusivity deals with popular apps.

""Competition is a good way to improve services,"" said Paulo Trezentos, CEO of Portugal's Aptoide, which takes a 15% to 25% cut of in-app purchases.

Deals for exclusive content could drive competition in app stores in the same way as it has in the ""streaming wars"" between Netflix and challengers like Disney+ and Amazon Prime, Trezentos said, adding: ""Netflix has content that HBO doesn't have ... App stores can be like that.""

Paddle, a payments processor for software companies, has built its own rival to the App Store, which it hopes to launch in Europe once the DMA comes into effect.

""A 30% fee is actually fairly egregious when we look at it in comparison to how much it actually costs to process payments, and what Apple is actually offering,"" CEO Christian Owens said.

Owens said Paddle's in-app payments system would charge developers between 5% and 10% on transactions.

""The biggest hurdle they are going to need to overcome is the consumer,"" Wood at CCS Insight said.

660,755,APPLE,2022-12-16,EU greenlights only half of global tax deal,"













BRUSSELS, Dec 16 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The European Union has at last found unanimity on the global minimum tax, half of an almost 140-nation pact to clamp down on global tax avoidance. Hungary finally dropped its veto this week, only for Poland to provide last-minute drama before finally allowing the EU to proceed. Whack-a-mole objections have become EU routine on tax matters, which require the unanimity of the 27 member states.

The other half of the global deal, struck under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development auspices in 2021, concerned big digital services companies. The aim was to make tech giants like Google, Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Apple (AAPL.O) pay a fairer amount of taxes on their profits, regardless of where they are booked. Here the EU is nowhere close to an agreement, and seems headed for a bigger fight.

In the meantime, trade wars over a hodgepodge of national digital services taxes are likely to continue. The U.S. suspended its trade complaints against the UK, France, Austria, Italy and the Czech Republic after the OECD deal. Those battles may have to resume before governments feel motivated enough to make more progress. (By Rebecca Christie)

661,149,APPLE,2022-12-19,Apple fined 1 million euros by Paris court over App Store practices,"













PARIS, Dec 19 (Reuters) - The Paris Commercial Court on Monday fined iPhone maker Apple (AAPL.O) just over 1 million euros ($1.06 million) for imposing abusive commercial clauses on French app developers for access to the company's App Store, the court ruling showed.

The ruling, seen by Reuters, said there was no need to order Apple, which has a market value of about $2.1 trillion, to tweak the App Store's clauses because the European Union's incoming Digital Markets Act would require changes in any case.

While tiny in size compared to the huge profits generated by Apple, the Paris court's fine is another sign of the legal pressures Apple faces to loosen its grip over the App Store, so far the only gateway for alternative app developers to access customers.

An Apple spokesman said the U.S. company would review the ruling and believed ""in vibrant and competitive markets where innovation can flourish.""

""Through the App Store, we’ve helped French developers of all sizes share their passion and creativity with users around the world while creating a secure and trusted place for customers,"" the spokesman added.

Apple faces heightened antitrust scrutiny over its contractual practices following the adoption of new EU legislation that targets so-called digital ""gatekeepers"" online -- tech firms whose platforms and softwares have become unavoidable for smaller digital companies.

The Digital Markets Act (DMA) in particular will force Apple and fellow tech giant Google to provide space for third-party app stores on their respective iOS and Android devices.

The DMA came into force on Nov. 1 and there is now a six-month implementation stage before it starts to apply for the most part from May 2, 2023.

662,581,APPLE,2022-12-19,Taiwan's export orders seen contracting at faster pace in Nov- Reuters poll,"Summary

Summary Companies For poll data click:

Orders median forecast -11.2% y/y (prior month -6.3%)

Data due Tuesday, Dec. 20, 4:00 p.m. (0800 GMT)















TAIPEI, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Taiwan's export orders likely contracted again in November, a Reuters poll showed on Monday, as global demand for the island's technology-related goods cools and at a faster clip than the previous month.

The median forecast from a poll of 18 economists was for export orders to fall 11.2% from a year earlier. Forecasts ranged for a contraction of between 6.26% and 20%.

Taiwan's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, fell 6.3% in October, dropping more severely than expected on weak consumer demand hit by inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes. read more

The government has predicted November's export orders to be between 14.5% and 17.6%, lower than those seen in the year-ago period.

Taiwan's export orders are a leading indicator of demand for hi-tech gadgets and Asian exports, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months.

The island's manufacturers, including the world's largest contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW), , are a key part of the global supply chain for technology giants including Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

The data for November will be released on Tuesday.

663,635,APPLE,2022-12-19,Chip dilemma will buy Beijing precious time,"













HONG KONG, Dec 19 (Reuters Breakingviews) - America’s chip war against China will make only partial inroads in 2023. After unveiling sweeping new export restrictions in October, Washington appears to have successfully lobbied friendly governments including Japan and the Netherlands to join. A full anti-China alignment, however, will be tricky while global semiconductors demand slows.

The latest U.S. trade rules effectively make ultra-high-performance microprocessors used in supercomputers off limits to Chinese buyers; as are software and equipment required to make semiconductors above certain technological thresholds, including high-end memory chips from China’s YMTC.

The move has prompted Apple (AAPL.O) to freeze plans to buy components from YMTC, Nikkei reported. Yet, most of the chips made in and shipped to China are less advanced technologies unaffected by the restrictions. This blunts the hit for both Chinese and American companies. Last year, Chinese imports of integrated circuits and related equipment topped $466 billion.

The outlook for China-dependent players in South Korea, Japan and the Netherlands is more uncertain. Memory giants Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and SK Hynix (000660.KS) have factories inside the People's Republic and won’t be able to maintain them without a U.S. licence. Both have secured a one-year waiver from the restrictions, but what happens afterwards is unclear.

For ASML (ASML.AS), which has a monopoly in advanced chipmaking equipment, the picture is similarly hazy. The company had already stopped exporting its most cutting-edge machines to China. But Washington policymakers are pressuring their Dutch and Japanese counterparts to also ban less sophisticated tools from ASML and Japanese peers. Both governments have agreed in principle to adopt “at least some” of the U.S restrictions, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 12. But the devil is in the details. Dutch Trade Minister Liesje Schreinemacher already said in November her government ""will not copy the American measures one-to-one"".

Curbs would be painful for the Veldhoven-based company: 2.7 billion euros, or 15% of total revenue, came from the People's Republic in 2021. Rival Nikon (7731.T) made sales of over 153 billion yen ($1.1 billion) in China, some 28% of total.

Slowing demand is another worry: Total chip sales will shrink 4% to $557 billion in 2023, a sharp reversal from the 26% growth in 2021, according to World Semiconductor Trade Statistics.

That will probably make companies wary of quickly and fully embracing Washington's requests. The hesitancy will play in China’s favour. It will buy it time to stockpile on foreign components and tools and help President Xi Jinping court trade partners. As Beijing knows, wars are seldom fought and won unilaterally.

CONTEXT NEWS

Japan and the Netherlands have agreed “in principle” to join the United States in tightening export controls for advanced chip-making equipment to China, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 12, citing people familiar with the matter.

The two governments are likely to announce in coming weeks they will adopt ""at least some"" of Washington’s restrictions, the report added.

In November, Dutch Trade Minister Liesje Schreinemacher confirmed the Netherlands was in talks with the U.S. government about new export restrictions. In an interview with local newspaper NRC, she said her government would likely introduce new export controls, but that it would “not copy the American measures one-to-one”.

664,754,APPLE,2022-12-19,TikTok bans hit more U.S. states; security firm says most access blocked globally,"













OAKLAND, Calif., Dec 19 (Reuters) - State agencies in Louisiana and West Virginia on Monday became the latest to ban the use of the popular social media service TikTok on government-managed devices over concern that China could use it to track Americans and censor content.

Some 19 of the 50 U.S. states have now at least partially blocked access on government computers to TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd. Most of the restrictions came within the past two weeks.

Some members of Congress last week proposed a nationwide ban, which would follow countries such as India that have already prohibited its use.

Jamf Holding Corp (JAMF.O), which sells software to organizations to enable filtering and security measures on iPhones and other Apple (AAPL.O) devices, said its government customers have increasingly blocked access to TikTok since the middle of this year.

About 65% of attempted connections to TikTok have been blocked this month on devices managed by Jamf’s public sector customers worldwide, including school districts and various other agencies, up from 10% of connections being blocked in June, the company said.

TikTok on Monday reiterated a statement, saying the company was ""disappointed that so many states are jumping on the political bandwagon to enact policies based on unfounded falsehoods about TikTok that will do nothing to advance the national security of the United States.""

In Louisiana, Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin said he banned TikTok on all devices his agency owns, citing potential security threats but without identifying any present issues. West Virginia State Auditor JB McCuskey said he did the same for his agency.

U.S. officials and TikTok have been in talks for months about a national security pact that would address the concerns about China's access to data on TikTok's more than 100 million U.S. users.

665,20,APPLE,2022-12-20,Apple finds a happy home in India,"













BENGALURU, Dec 20 (Reuters Breakingviews) - India is taking a bite out of Apple’s (AAPL.O) supply chains, and it will end up at their core too.

Helped by generous subsidies, Taiwanese Apple suppliers are starting to churn out more iPhones in India. Wistron (3231.TW) was the first to set up a factory to make the devices in 2017 around the technology hub Bengaluru. Foxconn (2317.TW), formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, and Pegatron (4938.TW) followed. Analysts at JPMorgan reckon India will have 6% of iPhone manufacturing capacity in 2022, and the rest will remain in China.

Shipment numbers are small, but India is at an inflection point. The newest iPhones used to be made in China first, with Indian factories only following with the same models some six to nine months later. This gap has narrowed substantially with the iPhone 14 and it could vanish over the next few years. JPMorgan reckons India might produce one in four iPhones by 2025. The product delivered $205 billion of revenue for Apple in the year to September, 52% of the company’s net sales.

Trade tension between Beijing and Washington, and Covid-related supply chain snarls, are merely an accelerator. India has used hefty import taxes as a stick to get companies to set up factories on its shores: The country is no longer a net importer of mobile phones because budget handset makers like China’s Xiaomi (1810.HK) produce enough cheap devices locally to cater to booming domestic demand. New Delhi’s more recent, generous production-linked incentives are designed to address the premium market for products costing over 15,000 rupees, about $180.

Incentives and other subsidies partially compensate for inefficiencies in India, where demand for pricier devices is slowly picking up. A phone that costs $100 to make could be produced for $80 in China, $89 in Vietnam and $92 in India, factoring in local subsidies and other expenses, per the India Cellular & Electronics Association. Apple will continue to rely on China too because India is years away from making key components, including the finished circuit board that can comprise half the value of parts that go into handsets. HDFC Securities estimates that for an average smartphone, as little as 14% of the value is added in India.

It’s the start of a bigger shift. Top exporters like South Korea and China focused on assembling electronics using imported items before trying to add more value. Whether or not India gets that far, Apple at least gets a happy new home.

666,526,APPLE,2022-12-20,Elon Musk plans to restrict policy polls to Twitter Blue users,"













Dec 20 (Reuters) - Elon Musk said on Monday Twitter Inc will restrict voting on policy-related polls to paying Twitter Blue subscribers, on the same day that users voted decisively in a poll for Musk to step down as chief executive of the social media platform.

Musk responded to a suggestion from a Twitter Blue subscriber, who said only subscribers should get a vote on policy polls, with ""Good point. Twitter will make that change"", without specifying when the change would come into effect.

Musk said on Sunday he would abide by the results of the CEO poll, but did not give details on when he would step down if the results said he should. He has not yet named a successor for the role.

Twitter re-enabled Twitter Blue sign ups earlier this month, with accounts for individuals getting a blue check, while gold and gray check marks will denote business and government accounts.

The monthly subscription price for the service is $8 on the web and $11 on Apple devices, respectively.

667,587,APPLE,2022-12-21,Intel splits graphic chips unit into two,"













Dec 21 (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) is splitting its graphic chips unit into two, the company said on Wednesday, as it realigns the business to better compete with Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O).

The consumer graphics unit will be combined with Intel's client computing group, which makes chips for personal computers, while accelerated computing teams will join its data center and artificial intelligence (AI) business, the company said.

The move comes as Intel doubles down on accelerated computing, a growing segment dominated by Nvidia as AI use surges.

""I don't think it changes much (if anything) other than aligning the products with the respective sales organizations they fit with vs. having them as a discrete segment,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Matthew Bryson said.

Raja Koduri, who led the graphic chips unit, will return to his role as chief architect and oversee the company's long-term technology and chip design strategy.

Koduri, who has led graphics technology ventures at iPhone maker Apple (AAPL.O) and AMD, joined Intel in 2017.

668,535,APPLE,2022-12-21,German cartel office ends proceedings against Google News Showcase,"













BERLIN, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Germany's cartel office has concluded proceedings against Google (GOOGL.O) over its online news service after the tech giant made several changes benefiting publishers, the office said on Wednesday.

The office said Google had abandoned plans to integrate the Google News Showcase into general searches and changed its contractual practice to make sure publishers do not face difficulties in asserting their ancillary copyright in response to its concerns.

A publisher's participation in the News Showcase will continue not to affect search results, added the office.

The cartel office said Google would implement further measures in the coming weeks, including providing more information about Showcase, and that it would continue to monitor this development.

Under expanded powers that entered into force last year, the cartel office has taken up cases involving several tech giants, including Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Facebook owner Meta .

669,488,APPLE,2022-12-22,India panel recommends digital competition act to rein in Big Tech,"













MUMBAI, Dec 22 (Reuters) - An Indian parliamentary panel on Thursday recommended the government enact a digital competition act to regulate anti-competitive business practices by Big Tech companies on its platforms.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has had strained relations with many large technology companies, and New Delhi has been tightening the regulation of firms such as Facebook (META.O), YouTube (GOOGL.O) and Twitter.

Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Apple (AAPL.O) have in the past faced scrutiny from the country's competition watchdog, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), over alleged abuse of the application market.

""The Committee recommend that the government should consider and introduce a digital competition act to ensure a fair, transparent and contestable digital ecosystem, which will be a boon not only for our country and its nascent start-up economy but also for the entire world,"" the panel said in a report submitted in India's lower house of parliament.

The panel recommended the identification of top tech players as systemically important digital intermediaries to counter monopoly and warned they ""must not favour its own offers over the offers of its competitors"" when acting as mediators to supply and sales markets.

In India, Amazon (AMZN.O) and rival Flipkart are facing accusations of anti-competitive practices, such as promoting preferred sellers on websites and giving priority to listings by some sellers.

Companies including Facebook (META.O), Twitter and Google (GOOGL.O) have for years been concerned with many regulations India has proposed for the technology sector, with companies complaining about excessive compliance burdens. The complaints have sometimes strained relations between New Delhi and Washington.

Amazon, Google, Meta, Twitter and Apple did not immediately respond to request for comment.

A specialised digital markets unit should be established within the competition watchdog, the panel said, adding that competitive behaviour of big tech companies needs to be monitored in advance and not after markets become monopolised.

670,113,APPLE,2022-12-22,Apple Watches violate AliveCor patents but import ban on hold -U.S. ITC,"













Dec 22 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) Apple Watches with an electrocardiogram (ECG) function infringe patents belonging to medical device maker AliveCor Inc, the U.S. International Trade Commission affirmed on Thursday.

The ITC said imports of the infringing watches should be banned, but that it would not enforce a ban until appeals were finished in a separate dispute before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), where a panel found AliveCor's patents invalid earlier this month.

The Biden Administration will have a 60-day period to decide whether to veto the import ban based on policy concerns. The commission set a bond of $2 for each infringing Apple device imported during the presidential review period, which it also suspended while appeals of the USPTO decision are pending.

Presidents have rarely vetoed import bans in the past. Parties can appeal a ban to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit after the review period ends.

Apple said in a statement that it ""firmly"" disagreed with the ITC decision but was pleased that the import ban was paused.

AliveCor CEO Priya Abani said in a statement that the decision underscored the importance of intellectual property rights for companies ""whose innovations are at risk of being suppressed by a Goliath like Apple.""

AliveCor accused Apple last year of infringing three patents related to its KardiaBand, an Apple Watch accessory that monitors a user's heart rate, detects irregularities and performs an ECG to identify heart problems like atrial fibrillation.

Mountain View, California-based AliveCor stopped selling the device in 2018 after Apple launched its own ECG feature in its smartwatches. AliveCor told the ITC last year that Apple copied its technology starting in Series 4 Apple Watches and drove AliveCor out of the market by making its operating system incompatible with the KardiaBand.

Apple Watch Series 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 have ECG technology. Apple introduced its most recent Series 8 in September.

A group of Democratic congressional representatives had asked the ITC in October not to ban imports of Apple Watches, many of which are made in China, even if it ruled for AliveCor, supporting Apple's argument that limiting access to the tech giant's heart-monitoring technology would have a negative impact on public health.

The USPTO's Patent Trial and Appeal Board declared the AliveCor patents invalid at Apple's request in a related case on Dec. 6. The tech giant has also countersued AliveCor in San Francisco federal court for allegedly infringing its patents.

AliveCor has separately sued Apple in California federal court for allegedly monopolizing the U.S. market for Apple Watch heart-rate monitoring apps, and has filed a related patent-infringement lawsuit against Apple in Texas federal court.

671,443,APPLE,2022-12-22,"YouTube, NFL strike deal to stream Sunday Ticket package of games","













Dec 22 (Reuters) - Google-owned YouTube (GOOGL.O) has signed a multi-year deal to exclusively stream the National Football League's Sunday Ticket package of games in the United States, the video service said, as more content moves to streaming from traditional TV.

YouTube will pay an average price of about $2 billion a year to secure rights to the NFL Sunday Ticket franchise, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Google and the NFL did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Starting next season, NFL Sunday Ticket will be available as an add-on package on YouTube TV and standalone a-la-carte on YouTube Primetime Channels, the company said on Thursday.

DirecTV, the largest satellite provider in the United States and which is 70% owned by AT&T Inc (T.N), had the rights to Sunday Ticket until the end of the 2022 season.

""We're excited to bring NFL Sunday Ticket to YouTube TV and YouTube Primetime Channels and usher in a new era of how fans across the United States watch and follow the NFL,"" NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement.

""For a number of years we have been focused on increased digital distribution of our games and this partnership is yet another example of us looking towards the future and building the next generation of NFL fans.""

Sports has remained one of the biggest and most reliable attractions for live viewing, even as U.S. audiences are cutting their pay TV subscriptions and migrating to streaming services.

Sports distribution rights are increasingly a draw for deep-pocketed tech companies seeking to grow streaming audiences.

MOST PRIZED

The NFL is the most prized sports media asset in the U.S.

In March 2021 the league said it had reached long-term media deals with Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN.O) and major broadcast and cable companies that run through 2033, divvying up packages of games. The deals could be worth over $100 billion, according to CNBC.

Amazon, which secured exclusive rights to “Thursday Night Football,” will also stream its first-ever ""Black Friday"" game on its Amazon Prime Video service next year. Fox will air the Super Bowl in February.

Apple (AAPL.O) - which is spending heavily on content for its Apple TV+ streaming service, and is the first streamer to have won a Best Picture Oscar - has also made a play for sports rights.

In June it announced a partnership with Major League Soccer to stream every game on the Apple TV app for the next decade.

In March it struck a deal to stream Major League Baseball games.

""YouTube has long been a home for football fans, whether they're streaming live games, keeping up with their home team, or watching the best plays in highlights,"" said Susan Wojcicki, CEO of YouTube.

""Through this expanded partnership with the NFL, viewers will now also be able to experience the game they love in compelling and innovative ways through YouTube TV or YouTube Primetime Channels.""

672,348,APPLE,2022-12-23,"Apple's Australian workers go on Christmas strike demanding better wages, work terms","













Dec 23 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) workers in Australia initiated a strike Friday afternoon, demanding better working conditions and wages, a workers' union said, a move that might dent sales of the tech giant during the peak Christmas shopping time.

Workers represented by Australia's Retail and Fast Food Workers Union (RAFFWU) had earlier this month announced a walk out from Apple's retail outlets nationwide at 3 PM local time (0400 GMT) on Dec. 23, with plans to stay away throughout Christmas Eve.

The strike comes in the wake of the tech giant facing disruption at its flagship iPhone plant in China owing to a rare workers' protest against ultra-severe COVID rules in the country and poor handling of the situation at the factory.

Earlier in June, Apple workers in Maryland, United States, became the first retail employees of the tech giant to unionize in the country as workers continued to criticize the company's working conditions.

RAFFWU, which is at the forefront of the strike, claims an eight-year old agreement denies workers ""weekends, consecutive days off, set rosters, set days of work, 12-hour breaks between shifts, overtime rates,"" among others.

""The 2014 agreement is one such agreement which pushed workers below the legal minimum,"" the union alleged, demanding the iPhone maker immediately return to the table and negotiate a fair agreement.

Apple declined a Reuters request for comment.

674,837,APPLE,2022-12-28,Tesla shares record rare jump this month on the way to worst year,"













Dec 28 (Reuters) - Shares of Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) snapped a seven-session losing streak on Wednesday, in their rare rise this month on the way to what will be the electric-vehicle maker's worst year on record.

The stock gained 3.3% on the day. It is set to round off 2022 with a 68% drop - the most among the big U.S. technology firms - as fears mount over slowing demand in China and top boss Elon Musk's growing distractions with Twitter.

""The shorts are piling on and the stock is way oversold here, which could drive a bounce-back rally,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said.

The company, whose meteoric rise over the last few years had burned many bearish investors, is the third most shorted stock in dollar value after Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners.

About 2.85% of Tesla shares, or $8.36 billion, are shorted, S3 Partners said, adding that short selling was up by more than 8.98 million shares this year due to a drop in the stock price, which was partly driven by Musk's share sales to fund his Twitter purchase.

Tesla short sellers stand to book a profit of $16.94 billion, their first gain since at least 2016, compared with a $10.26 billion loss last year.

""When Tesla's stock begins to tick upwards there should be a flurry of short covering ... as shorter-term short sellers look to realize their outsized mark-to-market profits before they evaporate,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners.

Short sellers borrow shares to sell them on the open market in the hope of buying them back at a cheaper price and pocketing the difference.

There could be more short selling until a firm-priced floor is established, Dusaniwsky said.

The stock also saw high trading volumes on Wednesday with 211.54 million shares changing hands, 79% above the 25-day average volume.

675,306,APPLE,2022-12-29,Pele brought glamour and goals to the Big Apple,"













Dec 29 (Reuters) - Of all the headlines Pele made on the football field, few of them came close to the remarkable announcement he made off it in 1975 - when he came out of retirement to sign for a little-known U.S. club called the New York Cosmos.

Soccer in the United States was then still largely unknown, with the nascent semi-professional league still populated by wacky teams comprising Latin American janitors, American college students and European construction workers.

Pele's arrival in New York changed that, bringing fans, visibility and glamour for a short-lived period in which football - and not the American version - become the hottest ticket in town.

""Pele has elevated the game of soccer to heights never before attained in America and only Pele, with his status, incomparable talent and beloved compassion could have accomplished such a mission,"" said former President Jimmy Carter. ""The United States is deeply grateful.""

Pele joined Brazilian club Santos in 1956 and spent his entire career there until retiring in 1974. But his businesses were in trouble and the idea of the big payday a return to the game would bring was highly attractive.

Talks that started in 1971 got serious in 1975, but Pele hesitated, afraid his compatriots would think him a mercenary.

He was eventually convinced to sign a multimillion dollar deal in June 1975, aided by then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who wrote a letter to the Brazilian government stressing how important his presence would be for bilateral relations.

The move was an instant success, with hundreds of journalists and photographers literally fighting to get a glimpse of Pele at his signing ceremony at the storied 21 Club in Manhattan.

SETTLING IN

It took the 35-year old a while to settle, but when he did the Cosmos were a force to be reckoned with.

They reached the league playoffs in 1976 and then won the championship the next year, with Pele making the all-star team both years.

His arrival saw crowds soar and advertisers flock to the club. Owners Warner Communications watched with glee as celebrity fans like Robert Redford, Mick Jagger and Andy Warhol followed the Cosmos fortunes, sometimes at the stadium and often at Studio 54, the hot nightclub where New York's beautiful people gathered.

Pele's success prompted Cosmos to sign other big names, including Italian Giorgio Chinaglia, West German captain Frank Beckenbauer and Brazilian World Cup winner Carlos Alberto.

Other clubs were also forced to invest to keep up. All-time greats such as George Best, Johan Cruyff, Gordon Banks, Bobby Moore and Gerd Muller were among those who enjoyed sojourns in a league where money seemed to be no object.

However, after Pele retired in 1977 interest started to wane. The league expanded too quickly, paid salaries they couldn't afford, and crowds and sponsorship fell. The last full season was in 1984.

Pele never regretted his move, however. When the United States was chosen to host what turned out to be a massively successful 1994 World Cup tournament, he felt vindicated, he said.

676,893,APPLE,2022-12-29,TSMC starts volume production of most advanced chips in Taiwan,"













TAINAN, Taiwan, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd (TSMC)(2330.TW), began mass production of its most advanced chips in southern Taiwan on Thursday and the company's chairman said it would continue to expand capacity on the island.

The long-awaited mass production of chips with 3-nanometre technology comes as attention focuses on the world's largest contract chipmaker's investment plans at home and abroad. TSMC has a dominant position as a maker of advanced chips used in technology from cellphones to fighter jets.

""TSMC is maintaining its technology leadership while investing significantly in Taiwan, continuing to invest and prosper with the environment,"" TSMC Chairman Mark Liu told a ceremony marking the production and capacity expansion in the southern city of Tainan.

Liu said demand for the firm's 3-nanometre chip was ""very strong"", driven by new technologies including 5G and high-performance computing products. He did not elaborate.

Earlier this month, TSMC said it would more than triple its planned investment at its new Arizona plant to $40 billion, among the largest foreign investments in U.S. history.

The Taiwanese company, which counts Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) among its major clients, is also building a chip plant in Japan and has said it was in the early stages of reviewing a potential expansion into Germany.

In an apparent response to the concerns that TSMC's foreign investment would undermine Taiwan's key position in semiconductors, Liu said the production was a demonstration that TSMC was ""taking concrete action to develop advanced technology and expand capacity in Taiwan.""

Taiwan's government has dismissed concerns about a ""goodbye to Taiwan"" trend for the chip industry, saying the island's position as a major semiconductor producer and maker of the most advanced chips is secure.

Liu said the mass production was successful and with good yields, adding that the new 3-nanometre technology would create end products with a market value of $1.5 trillion within five years.

TSMC said it was working to build factories for the next generation 2-nanometre chips, which were planned to be manufactured in northern and central Taiwan.

TSMC has repeatedly said that the bulk of its manufacturing will remain in Taiwan.

677,728,APPLE,2022-12-29,India's 5G smartphone shipments to cross 4G shipments in 2023 - Counterpoint,"













BENGALURU, Dec 29 (Reuters) - India's 5G smartphone shipments will exceed that of 4G shipments by the end of next year, driven by the mass adoption of the high-speed network and the rise in sale of handsets in the lower-price bands, market research firm Counterpoint said on Thursday.

Although India's overall smartphone shipments are estimated to see a yearly decline this year due to component supply issues and macroeconomic factors, 5G will continue to push smartphone demand in 2023 as well, Counterpoint added.

5G data speed in India is expected to be about 10 times faster than that of 4G, with the network seen as vital for emerging technologies like self-driving cars and artificial intelligence.

5G handset share in the lower-price band (less than 20,000 rupees or $241.55) is expected to surge to 30% in 2023 from 4% last year, Counterpoint said.

India's telecom leader Reliance (RELI.NS) is working with Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google to launch a budget 5G smartphone after it emerged as the biggest spender in India's $19 billion 5G spectrum auction in August.

Cumulative 5G smartphone shipments will cross the 100-million mark in the second quarter of 2023 and surpass 4G smartphone shipments by the end of next year, according to Counterpoint.

The analysis firm expects limitations like component supply shortages, inflation, geopolitical conflicts and limited availability of 5G networks to ease by the end of 2023, leading to the mass adoption of 5G.

Meanwhile, the Indian government is looking to push Apple, Samsung and other mobile phone manufacturers to prioritise rolling out software upgrades to support 5G in the country as many models are not ready for the recently launched high-speed service, Reuters reported.

678,577,APPLE,2022-12-30,India may review stance on Chinese investments to help firms relocate - report,"













BENGALURU, Dec 30 (Reuters) - The Indian government may review its stance on Chinese investments to help global firms looking to relocate to the country, CNBC-TV18 reported on Friday, citing government sources.

Several global companies are exploring a China Plus One strategy to avoid supply chain bottlenecks as the world's second largest economy grapples with a surge in COVID-19 infections.

Multinational companies are keen to pursue manufacturing in India, but want to continue existing Chinese joint ventures, CNBC-TV18 reported.

IPhone maker Apple (AAPL.O) wants China's BYD (002594.SZ) to be allowed to sign a joint venture with an Indian company to move iPad production to the country and the government might consider the move, the report said.

The government might allow joint ventures with Chinese companies in sectors where India does not have technical expertise, the report said.

India and China have maintained frosty relations following the worst border clash between the neighbouring countries since 1962 in June 2020.

Following the clash, India has blocked the nation from participating in government tenders, compelled Chinese companies investing in the country to seek approvals and banned dozens of Chinese apps.

Dec 30 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) Chief Executive Tim Cook asked Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to consider protecting users when regulating distribution of smartphone apps, Nikkei reported on Friday citing sources.

Apple has faced heightened scrutiny over its App Store practices that charge a 30% fee on payments and subscriptions and does not allow iPhones to use apps from third party app stores.

Cook asked Kishida to make sure that regulations around distribution of apps do not undermine user privacy and security, the report added.

Apple and the Japanese PM's office did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Earlier this month, Apple said it had invested more than $100 billion in its Japanese supply network over the last five years, as Cook visited the country.

Revenue from Apple's services business, which includes the App Store, has been growing at a rapid pace in the last few years and now hovers at about $19 billion per quarter.

680,868,APPLE,2023-01-03,"Foxconn's COVID-hit China plant close to resuming full production, sources say","













TAIPEI, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Foxconn's COVID-hit iPhone plant in China's Zhengzhou city is almost back to full production, with its December shipments reaching about 90% of initial plans, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.

Foxconn, formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (2317.TW), declined to comment.

Production at the world's largest manufacturing facility of Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhones was heavily affected late last year after a COVID-19 outbreak and curbs taken to control the virus prompted thousands of workers to leave. It was also hit by a bout of worker unrest over payment issues.

Foxconn has been offering bonuses to attract new workers and convince those still there to stay on. A company source told Reuters last month that it was aiming for the plant to resume full production around late December to early January.

""Production has almost fully resumed,"" said one of the people on Tuesday, who declined to be identified as the information was private.

The second person said production was nearly back to normal but that company officials remained cautious over the outlook due to a spike of COVID-19 cases across China.

""We expect a peak for cases before or after the Lunar New Year holiday,"" the person said, referring to the week-long break that starts on Jan 21. ""We don't know if that will cause any issues.""

On Saturday, the government-owned broadcaster of Henan province, where the plant is located, quoted an executive from the factory as saying that the plant's workforce was currently stable at 200,000 staff and that it had also stabilised its supply chain, enabling production capacity to recover.

The plant is able to accommodate as many as 300,000 workers.

The Zhengzhou plant's troubles highlighted the difficulties companies and workers had in adhering to China's zero-COVID-19 policy.

The central government in early December, after Foxconn's woes and a string of protests over the policy, abruptly dropped the policy to adopt a strategy of living with the virus. The move was greeted by widespread relief but has also precipitated a wave of infections across the country.

Jan 3 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and electronics manufacturer Foxconn (2317.TW) announced a partnership on Tuesday to develop autonomous vehicle platforms.

Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn said it will manufacture electronic control units (ECUs) for cars based on Nvidia's DRIVE Orin chip made specifically for computing in connected and autonomous vehicles.

The ECUs will serve the global automotive market, Foxconn said.

Companies developing electric and autonomous cars have struggled to bring products to the market in recent years as they grapple with rising costs and difficulties in ramping up production.

Nvidia said its technology, which includes chips to process information from sensors in real time, will help Foxconn overcome some of those challenges.

It sees a market opportunity of $300 billion in the automotive sector and reported revenue of $251 million in the third quarter from the segment.

The chipmaker said the tie-up will allow it to scale efforts to meet growing demand for chips made for autonomous and connected vehicles.

Foxconn, which operates a vehicle manufacturing facility in Ohio, said its vehicles will contain ECUs based on DRIVE Orin and Nvidia's DRIVE Hyperion sensors for autonomous driving.

Taiwan-based Foxconn makes electric vehicles for Lordstown Motors Corp (RIDE.O) and has a contract to make Fisker Inc's (FSR.N) second car model, PEAR. It also manufactures Apple Inc (AAPL.O) products.

The company said in October it hopes to eventually make cars for Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) as it ramps up electric vehicle manufacturing to diversify its business.

682,399,APPLE,2023-01-03,"Foxconn reinvents itself, and EV supply chains","













HONG KONG, Jan 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Foxconn’s (2317.TW) most important project in 2023 will be to remake itself. The Taiwanese company is best known for churning out Apple (AAPL.O) iPhones in China and shipping them around the world, but Chairman Liu Young-way is looking elsewhere for the next phase of growth. It’s a well-timed pivot.

Liu is repurposing the top electronics contract manufacturer into an electric vehicle powerhouse. Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, is gearing up to supply cars, and the chips and batteries that go into them, to global marques. It sees automakers entrusting the company with production in Indonesia, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, the United States and beyond. By 2025, Liu wants to take 5% of the global electric-vehicle market and generate annual revenue of T$1 trillion ($32.6 billion) – roughly 15% of Foxconn’s forecast 2022 top line, per analyst estimates from Refinitiv.

Getting there requires Foxconn ditching a tried and tested business model. To make smartphones, the company relies on a few factories it owns in China and it has little say over the underlying supply chains and which components to use. Cars, on the other hand, are bigger and harder to move, so Foxconn is setting up regional production hubs in partnership with potential customers. Its 40%-owned joint venture with Thailand’s PTT aspires to manufacture for automakers in Southeast Asia. Foxconn has also tied up with Ohio-based Lordstown Motors (RIDE.O) in the United States; its factory is already making electric pickup trucks and could start supplying to other American brands within a year. The Apple-like prize would be to convince a big established carmaker, like Tesla (TSLA.O), to outsource production.

Vertical integration is rare in the auto industry for a good reason: despite the allure of greater efficiencies and higher margins, upfront costs are huge, and it requires scale to take on chipmakers and battery giants like NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O) and China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology (300750.SZ). Recent chaos at Foxconn’s major factory in China, and the Taiwanese company’s falling gross margins, suggest its two-decade-long relationship with Apple is past its prime. That’s a good reason for Foxconn to shift gear in the year ahead.

683,341,APPLE,2023-01-03,Lawyers join Polsinelli from disbanding D.C. international trade firm,"Companies Polsinelli PC Follow















(Reuters) - U.S. law firm Polsinelli on Tuesday said it has hired a team of seven international trade lawyers from a small Washington, D.C., law firm that is now dissolved.

Polsinelli said Deanna Tanner Okun, the managing partner of AMS TRADE and a former chair of the U.S. International Trade Commission, will lead its new ITC Section 337 litigation and trade remedies practice. The firm already has a broader international trade practice.

With more than 1,000 lawyers spread across 23 U.S. cities, Okun said Polsinelli offers her clients a broader suite of legal services than her small firm could provide.

""There are opportunities for us to expand the work we do, and for our clients to come to a full-service firm,"" she said.

Okun said the partners at AMS TRADE voted to dissolve the firm at the end of the year; all of the former partners have joined Polsinelli.

AMS TRADE was previously known as Adduci, Mastriani & Schaumberg until January 2022, when Tom Schaumberg left the firm for the Washington firm now known as Levi Snotherly & Schaumberg. AMS's clients have included Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and Nike Inc.

Okun served as ITC chair from June 2002 to June 2004 and again from June 2010 to June 2012. Moving with her to Polsinelli from AMS are Daniel Smith, Lauren Peterson and Lydia Pardini, who are joining as shareholders, and Louis Mastriani, who is joining as a senior partner.

Sean Wesp and Joonho Hwang have joined Polsinelli as associates while Alissa Chase has joined as an international trade advisor, the firm said.

Among its duties, the ITC hears intellectual property disputes involving U.S. imports, and it can issue bans against products that are found to violate U.S. patents. Last month, the ITC held that Apple's Apple Watches with an electrocardiogram function infringe patents belonging to medical device maker AliveCor Inc, though the agency postponed any import ban pending appeals.

684,300,APPLE,2023-01-03,Apple's stock market value falls below $2 trillion,"













Jan 3 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) stock market value shrank sharply on Tuesday following its steep drop last year, leaving it below $2 trillion for the first time since March 2021.

The sell-off came a year after the iPhone maker became the first company to reach the $3 trillion market capitalization milestone.

Apple's shares declined 3.7% to $125.07 after Exane BNP Paribas analyst Jerome Ramel downgraded the company to ""neutral"" from ""outperform,"" slashing his price target to $140 from $180, according to Refinitiv Eikon.

Also exacerbating investors' worries that a slowing global economy and high inflation may be hurting demand for Apple devices, Nikkei reported, citing unnamed suppliers, that Apple has told suppliers to manufacture fewer parts for its ear buds, watches and laptops.

The drop in Apple's share price put its market capitalization at $1.99 trillion.

Ramel cut his iPhone shipment targets for fiscal 2023 to 224 million units from 245 million units, reflecting supply chain issues from manufacturer Foxconn and consumers cutting back spending on high-end phones.

At Apple's current stock price, the company's value is just ahead of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), valued at about $1.8 trillion.

Big Tech loses weight in S&P 500

With investors worried about consumer demand, analysts on average expect the Cupertino, California company to report a 1% drop in December-quarter revenue in the coming weeks, according to Refinitiv. That would mark Apple's first quarterly revenue decline since the March quarter of 2019.

""They (Apple) tend to skew to the high-end consumer device customer but even that demographic might be being affected by the high price of everything,"" Bokeh Capital Partners' Kim Forrest said.

Last year's steep sell-off on Wall Street punished tech-related heavyweights as investors worried about rising interest rates dumped stocks with high valuations.

The combined stock market value of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O) now accounts for about 18% of the S&P 500, down from as much as 24% in 2020.

Apple vs the S&P 500 since the iPhone's introduction

Even after its 27% drop last year, Apple has provided stellar returns to long-term shareholders. Investors who bought and held Apple shares when cofounder Steve Jobs launched the iPhone in 2007 have enjoyed a gain of over 4,000%, not including dividends, compared to a 180% gain in the S&P 500 over the same period.

Summary Companies Tesla shares plunge on Q4 deliveries miss

Apple marks lowest closing level since June 2021

Indexes down: Dow 0.03%, S&P 0.40%, Nasdaq 0.76%















Jan 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes closed lower on the first trading day of 2023 with the biggest drags from Tesla and Apple, while investors worried about the Federal Reserve's interest-rate hiking path as they awaited minutes from its December meeting.

Shares in electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) closed down 12% after hitting their lowest level since August 2020 and put pressure on the consumer discretionary sector (.SPLRCD) following a miss on Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter deliveries.

Apple Inc (AAPL.O) shares sank 3.7%, with the iPhone maker hitting its lowest level since June 2021, after a report from Nikkei Asia pointed to weaker demand. In addition, an analyst downgraded their rating of the stock due to production cuts in COVID-19-hit China.

The energy sector (.SPNY), which logged stellar gains in 2022, closed down 3.6% in the year's first trading day as oil prices fell on bleak business activity data from China and concerns about the global economic outlook. .

The main U.S. stock indexes in 2022 showed their steepest annual losses since 2008 following the Fed's fastest pace of rate hikes since the 1980s to stamp out decades-high inflation.

""2022 was a terrible year for equity markets. Some of the reasons for that haven't dissipated because we turned the calendar,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. ""There's still elevated anxiety, uncertainty about the Fed and inflation. Until there's clarity on that, it's going to be tough to make any upside headway in equity markets.""

Given Apple and Tesla's clout in the market, James also cited specific concerns about them for broader S&P weakness Tuesday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 10.88 points, or 0.03%, to 33,136.37; the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 15.36 points, or 0.40%, to 3,824.14; and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 79.50 points, or 0.76%, to 10,386.99.

The S&P 500 had shed 19.4% in 2022, marking a roughly $8 trillion decline in market capitalization, while the Nasdaq fell 33.1%, dragged down by growth stocks.

Among the S&P 500's 11 major sectors, behind energy, technology was the second biggest decliner, losing 1%, with Apple hastening the decline as it ended the day with a market valuation below $2 trillion for the first time since March 2021.

Tesla's biggest daily percentage drop since September 2020 helped make the consumer discretionary index (.SPLRCD) the S&P's third weakest sector on the day with a 0.6% drop.

The benchmark's biggest gainer on the day was communications services (.SPLRCL), with Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) leading the advancers there with a gain of 3.7%.

Investors on Wednesday will closely monitor the minutes of the Fed's December policy meeting, when the central bank raised interest rates by 50 basis points after four straight 75 basis points hikes and signaled rates could stay higher for longer.

Other economic data due this week includes the ISM manufacturing report, also on Wednesday, and December's jobs report on Friday.

Weakness in the labor market could give the Fed a reason to ease its monetary policy tightening, but the data so far has shown that market remains tight despite rate hikes.

Money market participants see a 68% chance the Fed will raise the benchmark rate by 25 basis points to 4.50% to 4.75% in February, with the rates peaking at 4.98% by June. .

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.42-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.20-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and five new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 92 new highs and 58 new lows.

On U.S. exchanges 10.618 billion shares changed hands, marking an uptick from the previous week's lower volume due to the holiday season. It compared with the 10.799 billion-share average for the last 20 trading days.

PARIS, Jan 4 (Reuters) - France's privacy watchdog CNIL on Wednesday said it had imposed an 8 million euro ($8.49 million) fine linked to ad personalisation in the iPhone maker's App Store, citing shortcomings with regard to user consent.

""The advertising targeting settings available from the ""Settings"" icon of the iPhone were pre-checked by default"", the CNIL said in a statement, even though that was not strictly necessary for the device's functioning.

It added that the case, which dates back to 2021, concerned an old version of the phone's iOS operating software.

The lobby group which brought the case had argued that Apple under iOS 14 had failed to ask iPhone users clearly enough for their prior consent to allow installed mobile apps to gather a key identifier used for targeted ads.

Apple said after the announcement it was ""disappointed with this decision"" and that it would file an appeal.

""Apple Search Ads goes further than any other digital advertising platform we are aware of by providing users with a clear choice as to whether or not they would like personalized ads"", the company said.

Apple's privacy updates, called App Tracking Transparency, give users the option to block apps from tracking activity across apps and websites owned by other companies.

The fine was higher than the 6 million euro penalty requested by the CNIL's top adviser.

687,110,APPLE,2023-01-04,Apple to sign Luxshare for iPhone production in China - FT,"













Jan 4 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is set to sign up Chinese contract manufacturer Luxshare Precision Industry Co Ltd (002475.SZ) to produce premium iPhone models, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.

Luxshare has been producing small numbers of the iPhone 14 Pro Max at its Kunshan plant, to make up for lost production at Foxconn's (2317.TW) Zhengzhou factory last year, the report added.

Luxshare, which was founded in 2004, became an Apple supplier in 2011 and has steadily moved up the hardware giant's value chain, from making connector cables for the iPhone and Macbook to manufacturing Airpods.

The iPhone maker and Luxshare did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Analysts expected Apple to diversify its supplier base amid production disruptions in China due to employee unrest at a factory operated by Foxconn and COVID-19 induced lockdowns.

Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, and Pegatron Corp (4938.TW) have so far held a dominant position in Apple's supply chain.

Apple in November warned of lower shipments of its premium iPhone 14 models following significant production cuts.

Wall Street expects Apple iPhone shipments to slip in the holiday quarter after Foxconn's plant in China's Zhengzhou city was heavily affected late last year after a COVID-19 outbreak and curbs taken to control the virus prompted thousands of workers to leave.

The Foxconn plant is almost back to full production, with its December shipments reaching about 90% of initial plans, sources told Reuters on Tuesday.

Industry research firm TrendForce said on Saturday that Apple decided to employ Luxshare as one of the assemblers for the upcoming iPhone 15 Pro Max.

TrendForce added that Luxshare's only iPhone assembly plant is located in China and it doesn't plan on setting up an iPhone production line at its Vietnam plant where it assembles Apple accessories.

688,608,APPLE,2023-01-05,"Qualcomm, Iridium partner to bring satellite-based messaging to Android phones","













Jan 5 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) has partnered with Iridium Communications Inc (IRDM.O) to provide a satellite-based messaging service on premium smartphones running Google's Android operating system, the chipmaker said on Thursday.

The partnership comes months after Apple Inc (AAPL.O) unveiled a similar feature allowing iPhone 14 models to send emergency messages via satellite in some countries such as the United States and Canada. Those phones also contain a Qualcomm chip that can talk to satellites when there is no Wi-Fi or cellular data connection.

Qualcomm said on Thursday the new service, Snapdragon Satellite, will be available in certain regions from the second half of 2023 starting devices using the second generation Snapdragon 8 mobile platform.

Snapdragon Satellite can also be enabled on other devices including laptops, vehicles and tablets, it added, without specifying if those devices would need any special equipment.

Using Qualcomm's technology messages sent through the service will reach Iridium's satellite network. They will then be communicated to the recipient or emergency services.

GPS-based gadget maker Garmin Ltd (GRMN.BN) will coordinate emergency response services to users, Qualcomm said.

689,92,APPLE,2023-01-05,Luxshare says client cooperation normal after Apple production cut report,"













SHANGHAI, Jan 5 (Reuters) - China's Luxshare Precision Industry Co Ltd (002475.SZ) said on Thursday its cooperation with current clients was normal, in response to a media report that iPhone maker Apple Inc (AAPL.O) had asked suppliers to cut production.

The electronics manufacturer said it wanted to clarify a recent report from a Taiwanese media outlet which said that Luxshare had suffered the biggest impact from the Apple request.

""There are no special changes or impact to the relevant business of the company mentioned in the report,"" Luxshare said in its statement.

""Currently the company's cooperation with existing customers is progressing normally and the business is moving forward in an orderly manner according to the work plan.""

Luxshare makes connector cables for the iPhone and Macbook to manufacturing AirPods and also owns factories capable of making iPhones.

A report by Nikkei Asia on Monday citing unnamed suppliers said Apple has told suppliers to manufacture fewer components for its ear buds, watches and laptops as a sluggish global economy and high inflation may be hurting demand for Apple devices.

Another supplier, Suzhou Dongshan Precision Manufacturing (002384.SZ), which makes printed circuit boards for Apple, said on Thursday in response to a query about the same media reports on its investor Q&A platform that the orders of its core customers were stable. It did not name Apple.

A separate report by the Financial Times on Thursday said Apple is set to sign an order with Luxshare to produce premium iPhone models. Foxconn declined to comment. Apple and Luxshare did not immediately respond to requests for comment. read more

690,599,APPLE,2023-01-05,Taiwan exports seen declining for fourth straight month in December: Reuters poll,"Summary

Summary Companies reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=cpurl://apps.cp./Apps/econ-polls?RIC=TWCPIY%3DECI

Exports median forecast -13.3% y/y (prior month -13.1%)

Imports median forecast -10.2% y/y (prior month -8.6%)

Balance median forecast $3.45 bln (prior month $3.43 bln)

CPI median forecast +2.5% y/y (prior month +2.35%)















TAIPEI, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Taiwan's exports in December likely dropped from a year earlier for the fourth month in a row amid fears of a global recession, uncertainties due to the war in Ukraine, and COVID-19 controls in China, according to a Reuters poll.

Taiwan, a global hub for chip production and a key supplier to Apple Inc (AAPL.O), is one of Asia's leading exporters of technology goods. The trade data is seen as an important gauge of world demand for tech gadgets.

Exports last month were estimated to have dropped 13.3% from a year earlier, a Reuters poll of 12 analysts showed on Thursday, slightly faster than the 13.1% annual contraction seen in November. read more

The export forecasts varied widely, projecting a contraction of between 7.9% and 19.5%. The variation reflected uncertainties over the global economy, supply chain disruptions due to pandemic lockdowns in China, and the fallout of Russia and Ukraine war.

Taiwan's finance ministry said last month December exports could be down by 8% to 12% from a year earlier.

Separately, the consumer price index was expected to have been 2.5% higher in December than a year earlier, rising faster than the 2.35% annual rate seen in November, according to the poll.

The inflation data will be released on Friday followed by the trade data on Saturday.

691,179,APPLE,2023-01-05,EU is stuck playing catch-up with Amazon and Apple,"













LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Europe’s antitrust tsar Margrethe Vestager appears to be clocking up some victories over technology groups like Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Apple (AAPL.O). But dig into the detail of the behemoths’ possible concessions, and it’s clear that they’re giving away very little.

The European Commission in December accepted commitments offered by Amazon, ostensibly designed to stop the $880 billion e-commerce group using its dominant market position to favour its own services. The measures include restrictions on its use of merchants’ data, pledges to highlight alternative buying options on product pages, and opening its Prime subscription programme to independent delivery firms. Separately, Apple may allow other companies to set up app marketplaces on its iPhone, Bloomberg reported. That could be an attempt to get ahead of Europe’s recently introduced Digital Markets Act, which sets up a code of conduct for dominant digital companies.

At first glance, such measures seem like wins for Vestager’s campaign to boost competition in online markets. Apple’s lock on the app store allows it to charge transaction fees of up to 30%, which critics like Spotify (SPOT.N) call a tax. App developers could skirt those charges if they’re able to reach iPhone users through a third-party marketplace. Meanwhile the Amazon commitments are legally binding, with a breach punishable by a fine of up to 10% of annual turnover, or $47 billion based on 2021 figures.

The problem for Vestager is that Big Tech can probably brush off the changes. Take the Amazon concessions. The company promised to let merchants selling under the Prime subscription use rival delivery options, instead of just the e-commerce giant’s own offering. But independent logistics firms probably won’t be able to match Amazon’s speed and still make money. Vestager’s data restrictions, meanwhile, should stop the company using information on small merchants’ sales to undercut them with its own-brand products. But that won’t trouble Amazon much: private-label sales were 1% of its total, founder Jeff Bezos told the Congress in 2020.

Any offer from Apple to allow competing app stores carries a similar risk. The tech giant makes it possible to download certain third-party software onto its Mac laptops, like the Windows operating system. But the cumbersome process can involve putting the computer in recovery mode and turning off security settings. Chief Executive Tim Cook could conceivably try the same trick with third-party iPhone app stores, for example by making users plug their device into a computer.

If Vestager wants the concessions to stick, she’ll have to be ready to pounce on any gamesmanship. Europe’s fight with the U.S. tech giants will not end any time soon.

CONTEXT NEWS

Amazon.com on Dec. 20 said that it had reached a settlement with the European Commission, which had been probing whether the e-commerce group abused its dominant market position.

The technology giant said that it has agreed to restrictions on the use of sellers’ data on its platform, changes to its website to highlight alternative buying options, and more choices for logistics providers under its Amazon Prime programme.

Fellow large technology company Apple is preparing its own business model changes ahead of deadlines to comply with the European Union’s Digital Markets Act in 2024, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 13. These include allowing app stores operated by third parties on its iPhone, according to the report.

692,232,APPLE,2023-01-05,Apple supplier Foxconn says output recovering despite revenue fall,"Summary

Summary Companies 2022 revenue reached record high

Zhengzhou plant hit by unrest over COVID curbs, pay

Shares close slightly lower















TAIPEI, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Taiwan's Foxconn (2317.TW), the world's largest contract electronics maker, said on Thursday output at its iPhone plant in China had ""basically returned to normal"" and December revenue, down 12.3% year-on-year, marked the start of a recovery.

Production of Apple iPhones faced disruption ahead of Christmas and January's Lunar New Year holidays, after curbs to control COVID-19 prompted thousands of workers to leave Foxconn's factory lines in China's Zhengzhou city.

Although lower compared with the previous year, the company said revenue for December was better than it expected and that a ""gradual recovery"" at its Zhengzhou plant had contributed to ""double-digit growth"" in revenue for its smart consumer electronics business compared to November.

A Foxconn source familiar with the matter, who could not be named because they were not authorised to speak to the press, said the growth in December compared to the month prior for its consumer electronics business, including smartphones, showed major client Apple (AAPL.O) did not cut orders.

A high base from a year earlier, when demand for smartphones revived after the early impact of the pandemic, also led to the yearly decline in revenue, the person added.

Revenue for 2022 rose 10.47% from the previous year to a record high, driven by growth across major product lines from smartphones to servers, the company said.

In the fourth quarter, the Zhengzhou plant grappled with strict COVID-19 restrictions, now being eased, that fuelled discontent among workers over conditions at the factory. It was also hit by worker unrest over pay.

Reuters Graphics

Foxconn has offered bonuses to attract new workers and convince others to stay on.

A company source told Reuters last month it aimed for the plant to resume full production around late December-to-early January.

Analysts say Foxconn assembles around 70% of iPhones, and the Zhengzhou plant produces the majority of its premium models including iPhone 14 Pro.

The company said in Thursday's statement it expects first-quarter revenue ""to be roughly in line with market consensus,"" without elaborating.

Analysts expect first-quarter revenue to grow by 5.6% year-on-year, according to Refinitiv.

Foxconn shares closed down 0.1%, below the broader market which ended up 0.72%.

BSD's predecessor lost similar patent dispute with Apple in 2014















(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc and its popular live-streaming subsidiary Twitch were sued Thursday in San Francisco federal court by an Israeli company that said their video technology infringes one of its patents.

B.S.D Crown Ltd, formerly known as Emblaze Ltd, accused Amazon and Twitch of violating its rights in a patent related to adjusting the quality of live-streaming audio and video based on changing bandwidth availability.

Emblaze previously sued Apple and Microsoft in the U.S. for infringing the patent. A California jury ruled for Apple in 2014 and Emblaze and Microsoft agreed to drop their dispute in 2015.

BSD's attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday, and a representative for Amazon declined to comment.

BSD said in the lawsuit that Emblaze was founded in 1994 and innovated streaming technology that now ""powers the majority of live broadcasts.""

BSD said Amazon infringes the patent with its technology for adapting video quality in live sports streams such as National Football League games as well as in Twitch live streams. Amazon bought Twitch for $970 million in 2014.

BSD asked the court for an unspecified amount of money damages.

The case is BSD Crown Ltd v. Amazon.com Inc, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 3:23-cv-00057.

694,70,APPLE,2023-01-09,Apple to replace key Broadcom chip with in-house design - Bloomberg News,"













Jan 9 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) plans to replace a Broadcom Inc (AVGO.O) chip from its devices with an in-house design in 2025, Bloomberg News reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The iPhone maker has been working to limit its reliance on other chipmakers, having moved to its own line of chips for recent models of its Mac computers, replacing those from Intel Corp (INTC.O).

Apple plans to replace Broadcom's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip, according to the Bloomberg News report, which added that Apple is the U.S. chipmaker's largest customer.

The Cupertino, California-based company accounts for about 20% of Broadcom's revenue.

Apple's decision is likely to hit Broadcom revenue by about $1 billion to $1.5 billion, said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with financial services firm AB Bernstein.

He, however, added that Broadcom's radio frequency, or RF, chips were complex to design and manufacture and were unlikely to be replaced in the short term.

Shares of Broadcom ended 2% lower.

Apple and Broadcom did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comments.

Apple is also looking to swap out Qualcomm Inc's (QCOM.O) cellular modem chips with its own by the end of 2024 or early 2025, according to the report.

Qualcomm has said it believes Apple will phase out its chips. Apple uses Qualcomm's X65 for 5G modem in its iPhone 14 line and is expected to deploy a newer version of the same chip in the iPhone 15 models likely to be released later this year, according to Jefferies' analyst William Yang.

A Qualcomm spokesperson pointed to the company's November statement where it said it expects ""minimal contribution from Apple product revenue in fiscal '25.""

Jan 9 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) vice president of services, Peter Stern, has informed colleagues that he is leaving the company, the Insider reported on Monday, citing a source close to the executive.

Stern, who joined the iPhone maker from Time Warner Cable in 2016, will leave at the end of the month, according to the report. Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

A prominent media executive, Stern oversaw an expansion of Apple's paid subscription businesses, particularly its television offering, Apple TV+.

The services business features News+, Fitness+ and iCloud+, among other subscription services, a key focus for Apple as it looks to diversify revenue away from gadget sales.

The unit generated $19.19 billion in the fourth quarter ended September, up 5% from the previous year.

The Insider report said Apple is reorganizing its services unit and Stern's responsibilities will be split into three separate divisions.

Companies Law firms Jane Horvath joins Gibson Dunn's Washington, D.C. office as a partner

She will co-lead the firm's privacy practice alongside three other lawyers















(Reuters) - Former Apple Inc chief privacy officer Jane Horvath has joined law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher as a co-chair of its privacy and cybersecurity practice, the Los Angeles-founded firm said on Monday.

Horvath starts in Gibson Dunn's Washington, D.C. office as a partner after an 11-year total run at Apple that ended in early November, according to a firm spokesperson.

Horvath will co-lead the privacy, cybersecurity and data innovation practice alongside former Facebook Inc deputy general counsel Ashlie Beringer, who is based in Palo Alto, as well as Paris lawyer Ahmed Baladi and New York lawyer Alexander Southwell.

Beringer in a statement called Horvath ""an industry powerhouse with deep relationships with global regulators and policymakers."" As Apple's top privacy executive, she led regulatory, policy and product strategy on legal matters involving privacy and cybersecurity, Beringer said.

Prior to Apple, Horvath served as global privacy counsel at Alphabet Inc's Google and as the U.S. Department of Justice's first chief privacy counsel and civil liberties officer, the firm said.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on her departure.

Gibson Dunn has made several other partner-level hires to its privacy and cybersecurity group in the past two years, drawing from companies, the government and rival firms. Other large law firms have also looked to bulk up in the practice area as companies navigate changing privacy laws and regulations and growing cybersecurity threats.

Bloomberg News previously reported in August 2022 that Horvath would leave the iPhone maker for Gibson Dunn, citing unnamed sources.

At 1,900-lawyer Gibson Dunn, Horvath will advise companies and management teams on matters including privacy and product strategy, advocacy with regulators and cybersecurity oversight and risk, the firm said.

698,872,APPLE,2023-01-10,Hong Kong authorities condemn UK minister meeting Jimmy Lai legal team,"













HONG KONG, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Hong Kong and Chinese authorities expressed strong opposition on Wednesday to a meeting between the legal team of Jimmy Lai, the jailed pro-democracy Hong Kong tycoon, and a British minister.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesperson told reporters on Tuesday Anne-Marie Trevelyan, a junior foreign office minister, had met his team and said the ministry had provided support for Lai for the some time.

""The British government will always support rights and freedoms and the rule of law,"" Sunak's spokesperson said.

Lai, 75, is the founder of now shut pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily and one of the most prominent Hong Kong critics of China's Communist Party leadership including Xi Jinping.

He was sentenced last month to five years and nine months in prison after being convicted on two counts of fraud for covering up the operations of a private company at the headquarters of the newspaper, in what was ruled a breach of its land lease. He had denied the charges.

Lai has been behind bars since December 2020. He is facing another trial in September when he faces a maximum possible life sentence, including for two counts of conspiracy to commit collusion with foreign countries or external elements and one count of collusion with foreign forces. He has pleaded not guilty.

The Hong Kong government said: ""We will never tolerate, and strongly deplore, any form of interference by any foreign power or individual with the judicial proceedings and internal affairs of the HKSAR.""

A separate statement from the Office of Commission of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong SAR said: ""The political plot of some forces in the UK to undermine Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability and interfere in Hong Kong affairs and China’s internal affairs by colluding with anti-China elements in Hong Kong is doomed to failure.""

""We urge the British side to recognise the historical trend, abide by international law and basic norms of international relations, immediately ditch colonial nostalgia, and do away with the moves that interfere in Hong Kong’s rule of law,"" the office spokesperson said in the statement.

699,414,APPLE,2023-01-11,Google argues it doesn't block rivals in bid to kill U.S. government antitrust lawsuit,"













WASHINGTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) on Wednesday argued that a court should toss out a government antitrust lawsuit against it, saying that agreements it made with Apple and others to make Google the default search engine do not bar smartphone makers from promoting rivals.

The statements, which were revealed in a redacted version of a motion filed last month asking the judge to toss out the lawsuit, preview the tech giant's arguments for a high-stakes court case expected to go to trial in September.

If Google loses, it could be forced to spin off key assets.

In December, Google asked Judge Amit Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to throw out both the antitrust case that the Justice Department filed in 2020 along with 11 states as well as a related complaint brought by 35 states led by Colorado.

The Justice Department's lawsuit, filed by the Trump administration, alleged that Google violated antitrust law in how it maintained dominance in search and search advertising. For example, it pointed to billions of dollars that Google paid annually to Apple (AAPL.O), LG Electronics Inc (066570.KS) and others to ensure that Google search was the default on their devices.

In its 51-page filing, Google argued that Mehta should throw out the Justice Department case in part because the company's agreements with Apple and others allow them to promote rivals, like Microsoft's (MSFT.O) Bing search engine.

The company also argued that its search engine was popular with browsers and consumers entirely because of its quality, and that it was inappropriate for the government to require Google to refrain from competing to be the default on smartphones.

""Requiring Google not to compete vigorously — or requiring browser developers to alter their product designs and provide a worse experience for their customers — would turn competition law on its head,"" the company said in the filing.

The company also argued that there was no evidence that agreements that Google made related to Google Assistant or Internet-of-Things devices hurt competition.

Google faces additional allegations of antitrust violations from dozens of states. The lawsuit filed by Colorado and others, which was also filed in 2020, also alleges that Google illegally limits rivals' ability to operate its Search Ads 360 tool, used by advertisers to manage online marketing campaigns. It also argues that Google broke antitrust law to hamper rivals, such as travel-oriented websites.

Jan 10 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is planning to start using its own custom displays in its mobile devices from 2024 onwards in an attempt to bring more components in-house, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

The company intends to begin by swapping out the display in the highest-end Apple Watches by the end of next year. Apple plans to eventually bring these displays to other devices as well, including the iPhone, according to the report.

The Cupertino, California-based tech giant is aiming to reduce its reliance on other partners such as Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and LG Corp (003550.KS).

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment, while Samsung Display, a unit of Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), and LG Display (034220.KS) declined to comment.

The report added that the screens would upgrade the current OLED standard to a technology called microLED.

Bloomberg News had reported on Monday that Apple plans to replace Broadcom Inc (AVGO.O) chips from its devices with an in-house design in 2025.

The iPhone maker has been working to limit its reliance on other chipmakers, having moved to its own line of chips for recent models of its Mac computers, replacing those from Intel Corp (INTC.O).

703,35,APPLE,2023-01-11,Exclusive: Apple supplier BOE plans new factories in Vietnam,"













HANOI, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Chinese display maker BOE Technology Group Co Ltd (000725.SZ), a supplier of both Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS), plans to invest a substantial sum to build two factories in Vietnam, two people familiar with the matter said.

The investment may total up to $400 million, one of them said.

The plan underscores efforts by technology firms led by U.S. iPhone maker Apple and Taiwanese device assembler Foxconn to lower supply chain exposure to China amid trade and geopolitical tension between Beijing and Washington and production disruption caused by China's COVID-19 containment measures.

BOE is in talks to rent dozens of hectares of land in north Vietnam to add to its relatively small plant in the south that supplies mostly television screens to South Korea's Samsung and LG Electronics Inc (066570.KS), the people said, declining to be identified as negotiations were confidential.

BOE declined to comment.

Northern Vietnam has in recent years attracted significant investment from electronics giants, becoming a major hub for the production of smartphones, computers and cameras, including flagship goods from Apple and Samsung.

Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn) (2317.TW) and China's Luxshare Precision Industry (002475.SZ) also make or plan to assemble a number of Apple products in the area such as laptop and tablet computers.

BOE plans to rent up to 100 hectares and use 20% for a plant making remote control systems at a cost of $150 million, one of the people said.

The rest would be for displays, with BOE spending $250 million to build a plant on 50 hectares while suppliers would use the remaining 30 hectares, all by 2025, the person said.

BOE plans to make the more sophisticated organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) screens at the site rather than liquid-crystal displays (LCDs), the person said.

Apple, which included BOE in its 2021 list of manufacturing partners, uses OLED screens for its latest iPhone smartphones.

China's biggest display maker by output is set to become the largest supplier of displays for new iPhones by 2024, analyst Kuo Ming-chi at TF International Securities forecast last week.

The U.S. tech giant, however, plans to start making mobile screens in-house by next year, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.

Apple declined to comment.

BOE's Vietnam plan is not specifically aimed at supplying Apple, the person said.

Customer Samsung, the world's largest smartphone maker, produces half of its handsets in Vietnam while LG has a large operation in the country and is planning new investment.

704,846,APPLE,2023-01-11,Global PC market seen to recover late 2023 - reports,"













Jan 11 (Reuters) - Global personal computer shipments are expected to rise starting late 2023, with a new cycle of system upgrades likely to accelerate growth next year, according to research firms IDC and Canalys.

Inflation-hit and recession-wary customers have so far been delaying system upgrades, but these will be pushed into the latter part of the year and trigger PC market growth, the research firms said.

""The commercial segment has several drivers towards growth, including the approaching end of support for Windows 10 and a building refresh cycle,"" IDC analysts said.

The recovery will be bolstered by an education demand bump in major markets as devices deployed during the pandemic peak reach the end of their life cycle, according to Canalys analyst Ishan Dutt.

""We expect delayed purchases to begin boosting the market in late 2023, with momentum picking up in 2024.""

The chip industry, too, is expected to rebound around the end of the first half of this year after a downturn, which was driven by a crash in electronics demand last year as red-hot inflation pushed consumers to be careful with spending.

PC shipments fell 16.5% to 292.3 million units in 2022, IDC said. Fourth-quarter shipments declined 28.1%.

PC maker HP Inc (HPQ.N) saw its shipments decline about 25% last year, followed by Lenovo Group Ltd (0992.HK) and Dell Technologies Inc (DELL.N), according to IDC. Apple Inc (AAPL.O) was the only major PC maker that saw its shipments grow in 2022, IDC said.

Shares of Dell and HP fell 27% and 29%, respectively, last year, while Lenovo dropped about 28%. Shares of PC chipmakers Intel Corp (INTC.O) fell 48% and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) declined 55.5% during the period.

705,798,APPLE,2023-01-12,TSMC foots the bill for global chip supremacy,"













HONG KONG, Jan 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - It's expensive being the world's dominant chipmaker. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (2330.TW) on Thursday reported a bumper end to 2022, with December quarter earnings up a blistering 78% year-on-year to a record $9.7 billion. But costs, from overseas expansion, research and development and other factors are forecast to eat into profitability as the market enters a downturn.

The company, which enjoys a near-monopoly making cutting-edge chips for customers from Apple (AAPL.O) to Nvidia (NVDA.O), guided first-quarter sales to be between $16.7 billion to $17.5 billion. At the midpoint, that represents a 14% fall from the previous quarter, thanks to plunging semiconductor demand. Notably, operating profit margin for the period is forecast to be as low as 41.5%, higher than rivals but more than 10 percentage points less than in the three months to December.

Fewer customer orders, cost inflation and unfavourable exchange-rate movements are factors. But TSMC also flagged R&D expenses will rise by a fifth this year, as developing next-generation technology gets pricier. Moreover, the company's new factories in the United States are adding to TSMC's expenses: executives said that construction costs are five times higher in America than in Taiwan. Capital expenditure is also forecast to be as much as $36 billion in 2023, roughly matching last year's level. The bills are adding up. (By Robyn Mak)

706,505,APPLE,2023-01-12,"Google, Porsche in talks over Google Apps access","













BERLIN, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Porsche (P911_p.DE) is considering fully integrating Google software into its car cockpit, a source close to the company said on Thursday, marking a shift in strategy for the newly listed carmaker.

The deal, which is only being considered for the Porsche brand and not the Volkswagen Group more widely, would enable Porsche customers access to Google applications like Google Maps and Google Assistant without needing to connect the car to an Android phone.

Spokespeople for Porsche and Google were not immediately available for comment. A spokesperson for Volkswagen software unit Cariad declined to comment.

Porsche Chief Financial Officer Lutz Meschke said on a conference call last October that the company was in close contact with Google and Apple as well as Baidu (9888.HK), Tencent (0700.HK) and Alibaba (9988.HK) in China following the end of its cooperation with Volkswagen's Cariad unit on software research and development.

Porsche had previously been reluctant to use Google software because Google asked for too much data to be shared, according to Manager Magazin, which first reported the talks.

Technology companies from Google to Apple and Amazon are in a race to control carmakers' dashboards as software becomes an integral part of car design.

Carmakers including General Motors, Renault, Nissan and Ford use embedded Google technology in their vehicles via a Google Automotive Services (GAS) package, offering features like Google Maps, Google Assistant and other applications.

But some automakers are wary of allowing the tech giants unfettered access to the data generated by connected cars, or to allow them to displace the automakers' brands with their own in dashboard displays.

BMW (BMWG.DE), for example, was ""definitely not taking the path"" of integrating GAS into its cars, a spokesperson said on Thursday: ""It is important to the company to keep hold of the customer interface,"" they said.

Porsche, which overtook its former parent as Europe's most valuable carmaker after listing on the stock exchange last September, reported earlier on Thursday a 3% rise in deliveries in 2022.

Jan 12 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) Chief Executive Tim Cook's pay package for the fiscal 2023 year is expected to be smaller than last year and depend more on how well the iPhone maker's shares perform relative to market peers, regulatory filings showed.

Cook's compensation for the fiscal 2022 year ended September was $99.4 million, slightly higher than the $98.7 million he received the previous year, the company said in securities filings.

For 2023, Cook's compensation target was set at $49 million, more than 40% lower than his 2022 pay. Apple made the changes after 64% of shareholders approved Cook's pay package at its annual meeting last year, down from 94.9% the previous year.

The biggest change came in Cook's stock awards.

For fiscal 2022, Apple granted him $75 million in stock awards, half of which were based on how well Apple's shares performed. For fiscal 2023, Cook's stock award target was reduced to $40 million, with $30 million of the total depending on share performance.

If Apple's shares hit performance thresholds, the $30 million in performance awards could double to at least $60 million.

Summary Companies

Companies Law firms Apple, Google, Intel challenged PTO rule on discretion to deny challenges

PTAB reviews dropped after rule took effect















(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Thursday heard a bid by Apple Inc, Google Inc, Intel Corp and others to revive their challenge to a U.S. Patent and Trademark Office policy that made it harder to contest the validity of patents issued by the agency.

A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit had pointed questions for both sides in the case, which was brought by Apple, Google, Intel, Cisco, and Edwards Lifesciences over a PTO rule governing the power of administrative judges to reject patent challenges.

The PTO's ""inter partes review"" process allows parties to challenge patents before the agency's Patent Trial and Appeal Board. The proceedings are popular with big tech companies and others that are often targeted with infringement lawsuits as an efficient way to head off the claims.

Companies including Tesla, Honda, Comcast and Dell filed briefs in support of the plaintiffs at the Federal Circuit.

Denials of inter partes review petitions rose after an internal PTO rule in 2018 outlined that judges can reject petitions based on the progress of related court litigation and other factors. A California federal court dismissed the companies' lawsuit challenging the policy in 2021, citing U.S. Supreme Court rulings that decisions about granting the petitions cannot be appealed.

The Supreme Court rejected petitions to review separate challenges to the rule by Apple and generic drugmaker Mylan Laboratories last year.

A loss at the Federal Circuit would leave companies with no way to challenge any rule governing the institution of inter partes reviews even if it is unlawful, the companies' attorney Catherine Carroll of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr told the Federal Circuit during oral arguments Thursday.

But Circuit Judge Richard Taranto responded that the policy was not in the same ""ball park"" as a violation of federal law.

The PTO's attorney Weili Shaw of the U.S. Department of Justice cited the Supreme Court in arguing that the office's director has ""unreviewable discretion"" to deny inter parties review petitions.

""You're saying her discretion is so vast that even the procedure under which she should be exercising that discretion is outside of court review?"" Circuit Judge Kara Stoll asked.

The case is Apple Inc v. Vidal, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, No. 22-1249.

For the challengers: Catherine Carroll of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr

For the PTO: Weili Shaw of the U.S. Department of Justice

Summary Companies Q4 profit T$295.9 bln vs T$289.44 bln analyst view

Q4 revenue up 26.7% on year at $19.93 bln

Sees 2023 capex at $32-36 bln vs $36.3 bln year prior

Company plans to ramp up production overseas















TAIPEI, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC (2330.TW) warned on Thursday that first-quarter revenue would drop as much as 5% and it would slash annual investment as the major Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier expects softer demand due to a slowing global economy.

The bearish outlook follows a forecast-beating 78% jump in fourth-quarter profit, underscoring the depth of a sharp slowdown in a global technology sector that is grappling with worsening consumer demand brought about by decades-high inflation rates, rising interest rates and an economic downturn.

Still, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) , the world's most valuable chipmaker, forecast growth would return in the second half of this year.

""We forecast the semiconductor cycle to bottom sometime in first half and see a recovery in second half 2023,"" CEO C.C. Wei said, adding the rebound would be boosted by new product launches such as artificial intelligence-enabled goods.

The world's largest contract chipmaker said its capital expenditure in 2023 would decrease to $32-36 billion from $36.3 billion in 2022.

Hopes of a recovery in the second half of the year and capex cut to manage supply sent the U.S.-listed shares of TSMC up 7.5%.

First-half revenue is seen posting a mid to high single-digit percent decline. First-quarter revenue is expected in a range of $16.7 billion to $17.5 billion, compared with $17.57 billion a year earlier.

INVESTMENT

TSMC's dominance in making some of the most advanced chips for high-end customers such as Apple has shielded it from downturn. But the company is likely to fall victim to the deepening slowdown, with the current quarter likely to mark its first sales drop in four years.

The fourth quarter ""was dampened by end-market demand softness and customers' inventory adjustment,"" Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang told a briefing, adding such conditions will carry into the first quarter.

""Given the near-term uncertainties, we continue to manage our business prudently and tighten up our capital spending where appropriate,"" Huang said. ""Our disciplined capex and capacity planning remain based on the long-term market demand profile.""

TSMC, Asia's most-valuable listed firm, backed by billionaire Warren Buffett's investment conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), has repeatedly said business would continue to benefit from a ""mega-trend"" of demand for high-performance computing chips for 5G networks and data centres, as well as increased use of chips in gadgets and vehicles.

It reiterated on Thursday slower demand was a cyclical issue and 2023 overall would be a slight growth year for the company.

TSMC said it plans to ramp up production outside Taiwan, as global attention focuses on its investment plan and various governments dangle incentives to boost chip manufacturing in their countries.

It said at least one-fifth of its 28 nanometre (nm) and more advanced node capacity, which accounted for most of the company's revenue in 2022, could be overseas ""within five years or more.""

TSMC late last year began construction of a second chip factory in Arizona which will start production in 2026, using advanced 3 nm. Its total investment in the U.S. project amounts to $40 billion.

CEO Wei said TSMC was considering building a second fab in Japan, and in Europe it was also evaluating the possibility of building a speciality fab focused on the auto industry without providing further details.

He added the company expected the auto chip shortage to be ""relaxed quickly"".

For October-December, TSMC booked record net profit of T$295.9 billion ($9.72 billion) from T$166.2 billion a year earlier. That compared with the T$289.44 billion average of 21 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.

Revenue climbed 26.7% to $19.93 billion, versus TSMC's prior estimated range of $19.9 billion to $20.7 billion.

TSMC's share price fell 27.1% in 2022, but is up 8.5% so far this year giving the firm a market value of $412.78 billion. The stock rose 0.4% on Thursday versus a 0.1% fall for the benchmark index (.TWII).

710,489,APPLE,2023-01-13,Justice Department official cleared to oversee Google probes -source,"













WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - The Justice Department's top antitrust official recently won approval from the department to oversee investigations involving Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.

The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the decision to allow Jonathan Kanter, assistant attorney general in charge of antitrust, to oversee matters involving the search engine and advertising company.

The Justice Department and Google declined to comment on Friday.

In November 2021, Google asked the Justice Department to consider requiring Kanter to recuse himself because of his work for a long list of Google critics like Yelp Inc (YELP.N), which Alphabet described as ""vociferously advocating for an antitrust case against Google for years.""

Bloomberg News reported in May that Kanter had been barred from working on Google investigations as the department considered whether he was required to be recused.

On Wednesday, Google argued a U.S. judge should toss out a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit against it, saying agreements it made with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and others to make Google the default search engine do not bar smartphone makers from promoting rivals.

The case is set to go to trial in September. If Google loses, it could be forced to spin off key assets.

In December, Google asked a court to throw out both the antitrust case that the Justice Department filed in 2020 along with 11 states as well as a related complaint brought by 35 states led by Colorado.

The Justice Department's October 2020 lawsuit alleges Google violated antitrust law in how it maintained dominance in search and search advertising. For example, it pointed to billions of dollars that Google paid annually to Apple (AAPL.O), LG Electronics Inc (066570.KS) and others to ensure Google search was the default on their devices.

Google faces additional allegations of antitrust violations from dozens of states. The lawsuit filed by Colorado and others, which was also filed in 2020, also alleges that Google illegally limits rivals' ability to operate its Search Ads 360 tool, used by advertisers to manage online marketing campaigns.

712,299,APPLE,2023-01-13,Tim Cook’s pay re-enters earth’s atmosphere,"













NEW YORK, Jan 13 (Reuters Breakingviews) - How to compensate Apple (AAPL.O) Chief Executive Tim Cook is one of the more puzzling questions for corporate governance experts. His pay has been out of this world, but then so has the iPhone maker’s share price performance. Nonetheless Apple, its investors and its board have agreed Cook’s pay should orbit closer to Earth in 2023.

The $2.1 trillion company has comfortably outperformed rivals over the past three years, with shareholder returns including reinvested dividends in the top percentile among its peers, according to Institutional Shareholder Services. Likewise, his annual compensation of $99 million in 2022 was over 4 times the median of peers, who include Amazon.com’s (AMZN.O) Andrew Jassy and AT&T’s (T.N) John Stankey.

On Friday, Apple said Cook’s targeted pay will fall to $49 million. That’s an improvement, but still generous. Apple says it will target his pay between 80th and 90th percentile among peers in future years.

A bigger improvement is making Cook’s pay less of a giveaway. In 2022, half of his award of Apple stock paid out automatically over time – so all he had to do is wait. Now it’s 75% performance-based, and his unvested time-based awards lapse if he retires. This is hardly space-age stuff, but at least Apple’s pay is no longer stuck in the past. (By Robert Cyran)

Law firms Related documents Caltech won now-vacated $1.1 bln award from Apple, Broadcom

Tech companies said they should be allowed to challenge patents















(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday asked for the Biden administration's views on Apple Inc and Broadcom Inc's bid to revive their challenges to patents owned by the California Institute of Technology, in a dispute in which Caltech previously won $1.1 billion in damages from the companies.

The justices asked for the U.S. solicitor general's input on a lower court decision that prevented Apple and Broadcom from arguing the patents were invalid at trial.

Caltech had no comment on the Supreme Court's order. Representatives Apple and Broadcom did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Caltech, located in Pasadena, California, sued Cupertino-based Apple and San Jose-based Broadcom in 2016 in federal court in Los Angeles, alleging that millions of iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and other devices with Broadcom Wi-Fi chips infringed its data-transmission patents.

A jury ruled for Caltech, ordering Apple to pay $837.8 million and Broadcom to pay $270.2 million. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit took issue with the amount of the award and sent the case back for a new trial on damages, which is set to begin in June.

Apple and Broadcom also told the Federal Circuit that they should have been allowed to challenge the patents' validity at trial. The patent-focused appeals court upheld the trial judge's decision to block the companies from making the arguments because they could have raised them in their petitions for U.S. Patent and Trademark Office review of the patents.

The companies appealed that decision to the Supreme Court last September. They told the justices that the Federal Circuit misread the law, which they said only bars arguments that could have been raised during the review itself, not in the petition.

Caltech has also sued Microsoft Corp, Samsung Electronics Co, Dell Technologies Inc and HP Inc, accusing them of infringing the same patents in separate cases that are still pending.

Apple is a major purchaser of Broadcom chips, and in January 2020 reached a $15 billion supply agreement with the company. Apple reportedly plans to replace Broadcom's chips with an in-house design in 2025.

Broadcom has estimated that 20% of its revenue comes from Apple.

The case is Apple Inc v. California Institute of Technology, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 22-203.

NEW YORK, Jan 17 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The similarities between Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) are drawing attention to what makes them different. It’s a problem for Goldman Chief Executive David Solomon.

Both Wall Street giants on Tuesday reported a slump in fourth-quarter earnings. Investment banking fees halved year-on-year for each, though Goldman generated roughly 50% more from deal advice and underwriting stocks and bonds than its archrival. Goldman’s trading revenue also increased nearly one-fifth from the last three months of 2021, while Morgan Stanley’s fell 12%.

When investment banking activity wilts, investors scrutinize the other businesses. Whereas Morgan Stanley boss James Gorman has successfully poured energy and capital into wealth management, which delivered an 18% return on equity, Solomon for years promised growth would come from consumer lending initiatives such as its credit card with Apple (AAPL.O). It hasn’t, yet. The division Goldman now calls “platform solutions” generated a negative 65% return in the fourth quarter.

The problem is that while Main Street banking was meant to add predictability to Goldman’s earnings, it has done the opposite. It lost nearly $4 billion over the past three years before tax, recent filings show. Back in 2019, Solomon told shareholders the consumer push had eaten up around $1 billion, suggesting the cumulative number is now somewhere around $5 billion.

Some of that is just bad luck: Banks must now take bad-debt charges when loans are made, which wasn’t the case when Goldman embarked on the strategy. Solomon concedes there are other problems, too, from personnel to plain-old overreaching. By waiting years to detail losses in a business once touted as “game-changing,” Goldman has lost some credibility. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley has stolen a march: Half its revenue is now from wealth management, and on Tuesday Gorman reaffirmed a longer-term goal of accumulating $10 trillion of assets, more than fund colossus BlackRock (BLK.N) has today.

It leaves Goldman on the back foot, and Solomon with something to prove, at the firm’s investor presentation next month. During the decade before he took over, Goldman traded at a premium to Morgan Stanley. Now investors value a dollar of Morgan Stanley’s net assets as if it was worth 40% more than the same dollar at Goldman, according to Refinitiv data. While the idea may be to stop investors from comparing the two, the discrepancies make it hard for them not to.

CONTEXT NEWS

Goldman Sachs said on Jan. 17 that it generated earnings per share of $3.32 for the fourth quarter of 2022, a 69% decline from a year earlier and 40% below what analysts had estimated, according to Refinitiv.

Separately, rival Morgan Stanley reported earnings per share of $1.26 for the same three-month period, 37% less than for the same span in 2021, and slightly higher than analysts’ forecasts, according to Refinitiv.

Goldman reported a $2 billion full-year loss for its new “platform solutions” division, which includes the credit card it offers alongside iPhone maker Apple. The loss is roughly double that of 2021, based on restated earnings published on Jan. 13.

The investment bank’s revenue from trading securities increased almost one-fifth to $4.8 billion while fees from advising on mergers and acquisitions and underwriting stock and bond issues roughly halved year-on-year. JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup on Jan. 13 reported similar plunges in deal-related fees.

715,86,APPLE,2023-01-17,Apple rolls out Macbooks with new M2 chips in rare January launch,"













Jan 17 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Tuesday unveiled MacBooks powered by its new and faster M2 Pro and M2 Max chips in a surprise launch weeks ahead of its usual schedule.

The roll-out of the devices using Apple's latest versions of the M2 chip, which it debuted last year, is an outgrowth of the tech giant's decision in 2020 to use semiconductors designed in-house after 15 years of relying on Intel's (INTC.O) technology.

The new Mac mini starts at $599 and will be available from Jan. 24. The 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro with the latest chips start at $1,999, compared with the $1,299 price tag for a 13-inch model fitted with the M2 chip.

The new Macbook Pro models were expected for months, but supply-chain issues meant the launch was delayed from last year to early 2023, Bloomberg News reported in October.

""This is all connected to the delayed chipset transition ... With it being delayed, Apple has been faced with the questions to wait for the traditional, expected launch or actually do something a bit unexpected,"" said Canalys analyst Runar Bjørhovde.

""This is a great way of throwing things around and surprising the consumers and competitors,"" Bjørhovde said, adding that the announcement could generate some hype at a time when the broader personal computer market is in a slump.

Shares of Apple rose about 1%, outperforming a broadly weaker market. The stock lost about 27% in 2022, its biggest fall since the 2008 financial crisis.

Apple said the new M2 Pro has nearly 20% more transistors than the M1 Pro and double the amount in M2, helping programs like Adobe Photoshop run heavy workloads ""faster than ever.""

The company, which gets its chips manufactured by Taiwan's TSMC, replaced chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA.O) as one of the top ten semiconductor vendors by revenue last year, according to a Gartner report on Tuesday.

""We estimate that the value of these (Apple) chips is equivalent to $17.6 billion in 2022. The growth coming from increased cost of ever more complex chips,"" said Andrew Norwood, VP Analyst at Gartner.

Apple usually holds its first event of the year in March, when it rolls out its iMacs and accessories. This year's spring event could include the launch of a long-awaited augmented reality headset, Bloomberg News reported earlier this year.

Jan 17 (Reuters) - Russia's federal anti-monopoly service (FAS) fined Apple about $17.4 million, the regulator said on Tuesday, over what it said was the U.S. company's abuse of its dominant market position.

In a statement, the regulator said it had previously found that Apple forced Russian developers to use Apple's payment services with the iOS App Store, in violation of Russia's competition rules.

It said Apple must pay the fine within two months.

717,662,APPLE,2023-01-17,Davos 2023: Colombia pushes LatAm corporate tax accord,"













DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Colombia is looking to supplement a global deal setting minimum tax levels for multinationals with an additional accord among its fellow Latin American countries, finance minister Jose Antonio Ocampo said on Tuesday.

Paris-based think tank Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in 2021 rallied some 140 countries to support a revamp of cross-border tax rules to take better account of the emergence of big digital companies, such as Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) that can book profits in low-tax countries.

Ocampo said the OECD-brokered deal, which is expected to take effect in 2024, did not adequately reflect the interests of many developing economies.

""The idea is to have a mechanism of real cooperation that will go over what we consider the frustrating results of the OECD negotiations of a couple of years ago,"" Ocampo told Reuters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum annual meeting.

""Only very large multinationals were captured by that regulation, which is too limited. And there is still a bias in favour of (countries that host) the headquarters of multinationals,"" he said in Davos.

Ocampo said he was approaching Brazil and Chile initially with the proposal, and planned to discuss it with Mexico. The goal was to have a finance minister-level meeting of interested countries in July.

718,852,APPLE,2023-01-17,Taiwan Q4 GDP seen growing 1.3% as cooling tech demand weighs,"Summary

Summary Companies reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=cpurl://apps.cp./Apps/econ-polls?RIC=TWGDPP%3DECI

Preliminary Q4 GDP seen at +1.3% y/y (prior qtr +4.01%)

Data due Wednesday, Jan 18, 3 p.m. (0700 GMT)















TAIPEI, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Taiwan's economy likely expanded much more slowly in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter due to increased global economic headwinds denting demand for technology which is a key export, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.

Gross domestic product (GDP) likely grew just 1.3% in October-December versus a year earlier, the poll of 20 economists shows, after it expanded 4.01% year-on-year in the third quarter.

Policymakers have said they expect full-year 2022 growth of around or less than 3%, slower than the 6.45% logged for 2021. That was the fastest rate in over a decade since it expanded 10.25% in 2010.

Economists' forecasts for preliminary GDP data due on Wednesday varied widely from a contraction of 0.1% to growth of 3.5%.

GDP last year peaked in the second and third quarters, with the fourth quarter hit by weakening electronics demand, and also coming off a high base, First Capital Management analyst Chengyu Liu said.

""Recent economic data released by the United States is also weak,"" Liu added. ""It is expected that Taiwan's GDP in the first and second quarters of this year will not be good, with growth in the first quarter only 1.1%.""

Demand for Taiwanese goods has been hit by COVID-19 controls and outbreaks in China, as well as soaring global inflation and tightening monetary policy.

The economy in China, Taiwan's largest trading partner, expanded 2.9% in the fourth quarter year-on-year, and 3.0% for the full year of 2022, badly missing the official target of ""around 5.5%"".

Taiwan's exports fell for a fourth straight month in December. Exports dropped 12.1% by value last month from a year earlier to $35.75 billion, the lowest level in 20 months.

Taiwan is a key hub in the global technology supply chain for giants such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O), and home to the world's largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) (2330.TW), .

Taiwan's preliminary figures will be released in a statement with minimal commentary. Revised figures will be released a few weeks later, with more details and forward-looking forecasts.

719,692,APPLE,2023-01-17,"Tesla video promoting self-driving was staged, engineer testifies","













Jan 17 (Reuters) - A 2016 video that Tesla (TSLA.O) used to promote its self-driving technology was staged to show capabilities like stopping at a red light and accelerating at a green light that the system did not have, according to testimony by a senior engineer.

The video, which remains archived on Tesla’s website, was released in October 2016 and promoted on Twitter by Chief Executive Elon Musk as evidence that “Tesla drives itself.”

But the Model X was not driving itself with technology Tesla had deployed, Ashok Elluswamy, director of Autopilot software at Tesla, said in the transcript of a July deposition taken as evidence in a lawsuit against Tesla for a 2018 fatal crash involving a former Apple (AAPL.O) engineer.

The previously unreported testimony by Elluswamy represents the first time a Tesla employee has confirmed and detailed how the video was produced.

The video carries a tagline saying: “The person in the driver’s seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.”

Elluswamy said Tesla’s Autopilot team set out to engineer and record a “demonstration of the system’s capabilities” at the request of Musk.

Elluswamy, Musk and Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. However, the company has warned drivers that they must keep their hands on the wheel and maintain control of their vehicles while using Autopilot.

The Tesla technology is designed to assist with steering, braking, speed and lane changes but its features “do not make the vehicle autonomous,” the company says on its website.

To create the video, the Tesla used 3D mapping on a predetermined route from a house in Menlo Park, California, to Tesla’s then-headquarters in Palo Alto, he said.

Drivers intervened to take control in test runs, he said. When trying to show the Model X could park itself with no driver, a test car crashed into a fence in Tesla’s parking lot, he said.

“The intent of the video was not to accurately portray what was available for customers in 2016. It was to portray what was possible to build into the system,” Elluswamy said, according to a transcript of his testimony seen by Reuters.

When Tesla released the video, Musk tweeted, “Tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway to streets, then finds a parking spot.”

Tesla faces lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny over its driver assistance systems.

The U.S. Department of Justice began a criminal investigation into Tesla’s claims that its electric vehicles can drive themselves in 2021, after a number of crashes, some of them fatal, involving Autopilot, Reuters has reported.

The New York Times reported in 2021 that Tesla engineers had created the 2016 video to promote Autopilot without disclosing that the route had been mapped in advance or that a car had crashed in trying to complete the shoot, citing anonymous sources.

When asked if the 2016 video showed the performance of the Tesla Autopilot system available in a production car at the time, Elluswamy said, ""It does not.""

Elluswamy was deposed in a lawsuit against Tesla over a 2018 crash in Mountain View, California, that killed Apple engineer Walter Huang.

Andrew McDevitt, the lawyer who represents Huang’s wife and who questioned Elluswamy’s in July, told Reuters it was “obviously misleading to feature that video without any disclaimer or asterisk.”

The National Transportation Safety Board concluded in 2020 that Huang’s fatal crash was likely caused by his distraction and the limitations of Autopilot. It said Tesla’s “ineffective monitoring of driver engagement” had contributed to the crash.

Elluswamy said drivers could “fool the system,” making a Tesla system believe that they were paying attention based on feedback from the steering wheel when they were not. But he said he saw no safety issue with Autopilot if drivers were paying attention.

720,422,APPLE,2023-01-17,Employment law giant Littler taps Chicago partner for new chair,"Law firms Littler Mendelson P.C. Follow















(Reuters) - Littler Mendelson, a U.S.-founded employment law firm with more than 1,700 lawyers that counts Apple Inc, Starbucks Corp and WalMart Inc as clients, said Tuesday it has selected one of its Chicago lawyers to chair its board of directors.

Michael Wilder is taking over from Kate Mrkonich Wilson after she exhausted the role's three-year term limit, Littler said. Wilder has sat on the board since 2021.

Erin Webber, Littler's managing director and president, said in a statement she looks forward to working alongside Wilder. A spokesperson for the firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Wilder has spent nearly his whole legal career at Littler, first as a summer associate and then as a full-time attorney starting in August 2006, according to his LinkedIn profile. In 2014 he joined Littler's ranks of shareholders, the firm's term for partners.

Federal court records list Wilder as the attorney for Walmart, as well as Waste Management Inc, Amtrak, and the American Bar Association, in a series of employment-related lawsuits.

Littler bills itself as being the largest law firm in the world dedicated to solely representing management in employment and labor matters. The firm is representing the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups that claim that a Connecticut law barring employers from holding mandatory meetings about unionizing is unconstitutional and should be struck down.

721,133,APPLE,2023-01-17,Apple supplier Foxconn replaces iPhone business chief- Bloomberg News,"













Jan 17 (Reuters) - Taiwan's Foxconn (2317.TW) has appointed Michael Chiang as the new boss for its iPhone assembly business after a tumultuous year in China, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Chiang replaces longtime leader Wang Charng-yang as head of the iPhone assembly division, the Bloomberg report said.

Foxconn declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Foxconn's plant in China's Zhengzhou city, the world's largest manufacturing facility of Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhones, was heavily affected late last year after a COVID-19 outbreak and curbs taken to control the virus prompted thousands of workers to leave.

It was also hit by a bout of worker unrest over payment issues, but the plant was almost back to full production with December shipments reaching about 90% of initial plans, sources told Reuters earlier in January.

Chiang's appointment is part of Foxconn Chairman Young Liu's efforts to elevate younger executives to maintain the company's supply chain leadership in the face of growing competition from Chinese contenders, the Bloomberg report said.

Earlier this month, the Financial Times newspaper reported that Apple was set to sign up Chinese contract manufacturer Luxshare Precision Industry Co Ltd (002475.SZ) to produce premium iPhone models, to make up for lost production at Foxconn's (2317.TW) Zhengzhou factory last year.

722,875,APPLE,2023-01-18,Alibaba’s pushy shareholder mistimes his moment,"













HONG KONG, Jan 18 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The U.S. investor behind activist campaigns at meme-stocks such as GameStop (GME.N) is going after China’s $305 billion e-commerce giant. He may not get far.

Ryan Cohen has been pressing Alibaba (9988.HK), for improvements since last August, per the Wall Street Journal. As the owner of an undisclosed stake, he wants the company to boost its share buybacks. There are similarities with cash-rich Apple (AAPL.O) where he owns roughly $800 million of stock. Alibaba is sitting on $48 billion of net cash as of September, up 4% since March.

It confirms Alibaba’s emerging status as a mature company: revenue growth is forecast to almost halve to 10% by 2025, per Refinitiv. But the case for buybacks was stronger before the stock nearly doubled from an October trough, when Beijing began easing its tech crackdown, scrapped Covid-19 restrictions, and as tensions over audits on U.S. listed Chinese companies thawed. Increasing share purchases as the storm settles, and as an obstacle in the company’s growth path clears, would be odd.

Past signs suggest Beijing would not work too hard to prevent overseas meddling, barring national security concerns. Foreign shareholders have successfully challenged buyout prices at smaller companies. Cohen’s move may have bad timing stacked against it more than anything else. (By Yawen Chen)

723,805,APPLE,2023-01-18,"Taiwan Q4 GDP unexpectedly shrinks, worst performance in 13 years","Summary

Summary Companies Preliminary Q4 GDP -0.86% y/y vs Q3 +4.01% (Reuters poll +1.3%)

2022 preliminary GDP +2.43% vs 2021 +6.53%

Q4 exports -8.63% y/y in U.S. dollar terms

Revised data, including 2023 outlook, to be released later















TAIPEI, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Taiwan's trade-dependent economy unexpectedly contracted in the fourth quarter, putting in its worst performance in 13 years, hit by a drop in exports on slowing global tech demand and COVID-related chaos in its largest market China.

For the October-December period, annual gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 0.86% from the same period a year earlier, compared with 4.01% growth for the previous quarter, preliminary data from the statistics agency showed on Wednesday.

That was worse than an increase of 1.3% forecast in a Reuters poll, and the worst quarterly performance since the economy contracted 1.13% in the third quarter of 2009, when the world was dealing with a financial crisis.

Compared with the previous quarter, Taiwan's economy contracted 4.24% at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.

""External demand has weakened significantly,"" the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics said, pointing to global inflation and interest rate rises suppressing demand and ""the deterioration of the pandemic in mainland China interfering with consumption and production activities"".

For all of 2022, the economy expanded a preliminary 2.43%, compared to 6.53% logged for 2021. That was slightly slower than last year's 3% growth recorded in China, which was hit hard by stringent COVID curbs and a property market slump.

Taiwan's total fourth-quarter exports dropped 8.63% from a year earlier in U.S. dollar terms, the agency said.

As a key hub in the global technology supply chain for giants such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Taiwan's economy had outperformed many regional peers during the pandemic as it benefited from robust demand for tech exports as more people turned to working and studying from home.

But global economic woes driven by soaring inflation and the impact of the war in Ukraine, as well as China's pandemic situation, has impacted demand for made-in-Taiwan goods.

Taiwan will release revised GDP figures at a later date, yet to be set, including full-year growth forecasts for 2023. In November, the statistics agency revised down its full year 2023 outlook to 2.75% from a previous forecast of 3.05%.

724,734,APPLE,2023-01-18,Pyrex maker settles over false 'Made in USA' claims,"













Jan 18 (Reuters) - The maker of Pyrex kitchenware agreed to pay a fine and change its marketing practices to settle U.S. claims that it falsely advertised its popular glass measuring cups as ""Made in USA"" while importing some of them from China.

Instant Brands LLC did not admit or deny wrongdoing in Wednesday's settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, which approved it by a 4-0 vote.

The FTC said Instant Brands shifted some production of Pyrex cups, which are used in home baking, to China from March 2021 to May 2022 after being unable to meet demand on Amazon.com's website early in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite the shift, Instant Brands marketed the Chinese-made cups as ""Made in USA"" and as ""American as Apple Pie"" though the cups were marked ""Made in China,"" the FTC said.

More than 110,000 Chinese-made cup sets that were advertised as ""Made in USA"" were sold to U.S. consumers, many of whom complained after seeing where the cups were made, the FTC said.

Some consumers are willing to pay more for products made in the United States.

The settlement calls for Instant Brands to pay a $129,416 fine, and stop claiming its products are U.S.-made unless their final assembly and all significant processing take place there, and virtually all components are sourced domestically.

Instant Brands did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Downers Grove, Illinois-based company is controlled by private equity firm Cornell Capital LLC.

In 2021, the FTC adopted a ""Made in USA Labeling Rule"" to protect businesses and consumers from what it called ""rampant"" fraud by marketers over their products' origins.

Jan 18 (Reuters) - Keen to buttress margins and appease investor concerns at a time of slowing sales growth, big U.S. technology firms are expected to whittle away at their bloated workforce and costs through the next few months, reversing pandemic-era excesses, analysts said.

Each of America's five largest tech companies, though, are expected to report a fall in profits for the October-December period, as they try to recalibrate in a high-interest environment. Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) are expected to report the biggest declines.

Analysts have cut their total revenue projection for the five companies - Meta, Amazon, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) - by 5% to $561.4 billion as of January from October.

Big tech companies are expected to be among the biggest drags to S&P 500's eleven sectors, with the information technology sector projected to report an earnings decline of 9.5%, according to FactSet data.

Reuters Graphics

""I would not expect good news for a while ... at least for the next three quarters. I would expect more layoffs,"" said Siddharth Singhai, chief investment officer at investment firm Ironhold Capital.

Amazon, which is expected to report that earnings slumped 38% and revenue grew at the slowest pace in over 22 years, started communicating to staff on Wednesday whether they were laid off as part of its decision to cut 18,000 jobs.

The reduction in workforce came after the retailer overhired based on pandemic demand, echoing Meta's aggressive hiring to meet a surge in social media usage by stuck-at-home consumers.

Meta, which decided in November to chop 11,000 jobs, could see a 42% plunge in profit, its fifth straight quarter of decline. The company is also likely to see a 7% fall in revenue - its worst showing ever.

The five companies on an average increased their employee base by 45% in 2020 and 20.5% in 2021, with Apple hiring the most modestly.

""We are forecasting another 5% to 10% headcount cut across the tech sector as many of these companies were spending money like 1980s rockstars,"" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.

Microsoft said on Wednesday it would eliminate 10,000 roles, affecting less than 5% of its employees. Analysts expect the company to report a 2.4% rise in revenue, the slowest pace in about 24 quarters. Profit is expected to fall 9%.

Reuters Graphics

Apple's revenue is expected to fall for the first time in 15 quarters as its major supplier Foxconn (2317.TW) faced major disruption at the biggest iPhone factory in China due to worker unrest related to COVID curbs.

Revenue growth at Alphabet, which is slowing hiring and making ""course corrections"" to cut costs, is expected to be the slowest in 10 quarters.

To shore up stock prices, analysts said these companies could pour money into buybacks this year. Their shares fell between 26% and over 60% last year versus the broader market's nearly 20% decline.

They together have cash and cash equivalents of over $110 billion, with Amazon having the most and Meta having the least at the end of the September quarter.

726,575,APPLE,2023-01-18,Disney investors pay twice for half-leadership,"













NEW YORK, Jan 18 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Walt Disney’s (DIS.N) poor succession planning is costing its shareholders twice over. The entertainment giant has earmarked around $60 million in pay and severance for former Chief Executive Bob Chapek and his replacement Bob Iger – who is returning for a second go as CEO. It’s a princely sum, at odds with a dysfunctional kingdom.

Chapek, who was fired without cause in November a mere six months after the board renewed his contract, is getting about $20 million in his termination agreement, according to Disney’s annual filing published on Tuesday. That includes salary, pro-rated bonus and restricted stock units. Since Chapek had fulfilled his term as chief executive at the end of Disney’s fiscal year ending September 2022, he gets a compensation package worth $24 million too, giving a grand total of roughly $45 million.

Then there’s Iger, who both picked Chapek in 2020 and replaced him in 2022. The former-current Disney boss was awarded$15 million in compensation last year. That takes Disney to $60 million in total pay for the duo. One comfort is that Iger is this year in line for a more modest $28 million, a little more than half of what he got in 2019.

Lesser companies pay more, it’s true. Warner Bros Discovery (WBD.O), a fraction of Disney’s size, awarded its boss David Zaslav a $247 million compensation package in 2021. But a better comparison would be Apple (AAPL.O) Chief Executive Tim Cook. He is in line for a downsized $49 million compensation package this year, after the company’s board halved his pay from the previous year, in a nod to keeping shareholders happy. Apple is worth 11 Disneys in terms of market value.

Disney’s challenges jar with its generosity. Iger, as former chairman, is partly to blame for the unnecessarily abrupt changing of the guard that saw Chapek come and then go. Activist investor Nelson Peltz is lobbying for a seat on the board, and all the while the media sector is heading into an advertising recession. Shareholders will get a non-binding say on the company’s pay at its upcoming annual meeting. A “for” vote would require Disney-esque levels of magical thinking.

CONTEXT NEWS

Walt Disney allocated $24 million in compensation to former Chief Executive Bob Chapek for the fiscal year ending September 2022, according to its annual shareholder filing published on Jan. 17. Chapek was fired in November. He also received $6.5 million in base salary, a pro-rated bonus of $1 million and $12.7 million in restricted stock units under his termination agreement.

Chief Executive Bob Iger, who both succeeded Chapek and preceded him as Disney CEO, was awarded a compensation package of $15 million for the 2022 fiscal year, the proxy filing shows. For the 2023 fiscal year, his target compensation package in 2023 is approximately $28 million.

Disney urged shareholders to vote for its slate of directors at the company’s upcoming annual meeting. Activist investor Nelson Peltz, through his company Trian Fund Management, has challenged Disney by seeking a seat on the board.

727,301,APPLE,2023-01-18,Spotify joins media firms to urge EU action against Apple's 'unfair' practices,"













Jan 18 (Reuters) - Music streaming service Spotify Technology (SPOT.N), along with other media firms such as Deezer, urged the European Commission to take action against Apple Inc (AAPL.O) for anticompetitive and unfair practices, in a joint industry letter on Wednesday.

The letter, addressed to the European Union antitrust regulator's Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, demanded the Commission to act fast for the welfare of European consumers.

Spotify has for years accused Apple of abusing its market position using its App Store rules to stifle competition.

It has previously submitted antitrust complaints against Apple in various countries, alleging the 30% charge Apple requires developers to pay on its App Store has forced Spotify to ""artificially inflate"" its own prices.

""We are writing to you to call for swift and decisive action by the European Commission against anticompetitive and unfair practices by certain global digital gatekeepers, and Apple in particular,"" read the letter, which was signed by chief executives of media firms Schibsted, Proton and Basecamp.

Spotify's Chief Executive Daniel Ek had previously said the iPhone maker ""gives itself every advantage while at the same time stifling innovation and hurting consumers"".

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

728,37,APPLE,2023-01-18,Brazil antitrust agency to investigate MercadoLibre complaint against Apple,"













BRASILIA, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Brazil's antitrust watchdog CADE has begun investigating a complaint by e-commerce retailer MercadoLibre Inc (MELI.O) against Apple Inc (AAPL.O) for alleged abuse of a monopoly in the distribution of apps for its devices, the regulator said on Wednesday.

The decision to open the investigation into alleged anti-competitive practices by Apple was taken last week based on the complaint filed in December by MercadoLibre, CADE said in a statement.

""Similar investigations are being conducted by antitrust authorities in other jurisdictions,"" the watchdog said.

MercadoLibre argued that Apple had imposed a series of restrictions on the distribution of digital goods and in-app purchases.

The South American company criticized the California tech giant for requiring developers who offer digital goods or services within apps to use Apple's own payment system and stopping them from redirecting buyers to their websites.

MercadoLibre filed its complaint in Brazil and also Mexico.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Apple's policies have been challenged in nearly every corner of the world over the past few years.

In a U.S. court trial over similar allegations, a judge found that Apple had not violated antitrust law in part because its rules led to security benefits for users that outweighed any harm to appmakers. But the ruling is being appealed and a global resolution on the issue appears distant.

CADE said antitrust cases against Apple are underway around the world, including in the European Union, Britain, South Korea, Japan, India and Indonesia.

Nasdaq-listed MercadoLibre is one of Latin America's largest companies, with a market capitalization of $53.82 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

729,31,APPLE,2023-01-18,Apple indefinitely postpones launch of AR glasses - Bloomberg News,"













Jan 17 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has postponed the launch of its lightweight augmented-reality glasses indefinitely due to technical challenges, but is still planning to unveil its first mixed-reality headset this year, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.

The iPhone maker's mixed-reality headset - which combines both augmented and virtual reality - is set to launch in this year's spring event, Bloomberg said, adding that the device will cost around $3,000.

Apple's mixed-reality device would compete with the likes of Meta Platforms' (META.O) Quest Pro virtual and mixed-reality headset, which it launched late last year for $1,500, half of the Apple device's reported price.

The Cupertino, California-based company now plans to focus on lowering the price of the follow-up version of its mixed-reality device, expected as soon as 2024 or early 2025, instead of working on the AR glasses, according to the report.

Apple will aim to do so by using chips on par with those in the iPhone rather than components found in higher-end Mac computers.

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The Information website first reported Apple's plans to unveil a cheaper mixed-reality headset on Tuesday.

earlier in the day, the iPhone maker unveiled MacBooks powered by its new and faster M2 Pro and M2 Max chips in a surprise launch weeks ahead of its usual schedule.

730,759,APPLE,2023-01-18,OECD sees revenue gains from new tax pact reaching $250 billion,"[1/2] U.S. one dollar banknotes are seen in this illustration taken February 8, 2021. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration















PARIS, Jan 18 (Reuters) - New cross-border corporate tax rules could yield about a quarter of a trillion dollars in extra revenue for governments, more than previously expected, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development estimated on Wednesday.

Nearly 140 countries are preparing to implement next year a 2021 deal on government's rights to tax multinationals in order to take account of the emergence of big digital companies such as Apple and Amazon, which can book profits in low-tax countries.

The first pillar of the two-track reform aims to re-allocate 25% of profits from the world's largest multinationals for taxation in the countries where their clients are, regardless of the companies' physical location.

The second pillar aims to set a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% by allowing governments to apply a top-up tax to that level on any profits booked in a country with a lower rate.

The OECD estimated that the minimum tax would yield $220 billion, or 9% of global corporate income tax - up from a previous estimate of $150 billion.

Meanwhile, the re-allocation of taxing rights under the first pillar of the reform was now expected to cover $200 billion in multinationals' profits, up from $125 billion previously.

The increase was mainly due to higher multinational profits now than a couple of years ago, with 50% coming from large digital groups, the OECD said.

As a result of more profit being covered, the second pillar was now seen generating tax gains of between $13 billion and $36 billion.

While developing countries have criticised the reform over concerns that they could lose out, the OECD's updated analysis found that low- and middle-income countries would gain the most from the re-allocation of taxing rights.

At the same time, low-tax investment hubs where multinationals have booked their profits until now would end up surrendering more taxing rights than they are allocated, the OECD said.

WASHINGTON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The United States' union membership rate, or percentage of wage and salary workers who belong to unions, edged down to an all-time low in 2022, data released by a government agency showed.

The union membership rate fell from 10.3% in 2021 to 10.1% in 2022, according to data released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Thursday.

However, the number of wage and salary workers who are members of unions, at 14.3 million last year, increased by 273,000, or 1.9%, from 2021, the data showed. The total number of wage and salary workers grew by 5.3 million, or 3.9%, most of them non-union workers.

""This disproportionately large increase in the number of total wage and salary employment compared with the increase in the number of union members led to a decrease in the union membership rate,"" the Bureau of Labor Statistics said in a statement.

The data released Thursday shows that while unionization efforts have come into the limelight, they have not translated into greater representation of the workforce.

A surge in union organizing began during the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. and has included unprecedented efforts to unionize Amazon.com Inc(AMZN.O) warehouses, Starbucks(SBUX.O) cafes, Apple Inc(AAPL.O) retail stores and video game developers.

In December, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the agency that enforces U.S. labor laws, made it easier for unions to organize small groups of a company's workforce, a move that was expected to give them a key advantage in campaigns to unionize factories, warehouses, universities and other sprawling workplaces.

The data on union membership is collected as part of the Current Population Survey, a monthly survey of about 60,000 eligible households that obtains information on employment and unemployment among the United States' civilian, non-institutional population age 16 and over.

732,523,APPLE,2023-01-20,Wall St Week Ahead Tech stock rebound faces doubters with earnings season ahead,"













NEW YORK, Jan 20 (Reuters) - A spate of earnings reports in coming weeks is set to test a recent bounce in technology and other megacap stocks, a category whose leadership position in U.S. markets has faltered after last year’s deep selloff.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index (.NDX) has gained nearly 6.2% in 2023, compared to a 3.45% rise for the S&P 500 (.SPX). Shares of some megacap companies - which include those grouped outside of tech in sectors like communication services and consumer discretionary - have shot higher, with Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta Platforms (META.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O) posting double-digit percentage increases.

Several factors are driving that outperformance, including investors piling into stocks they believe were overly punished in 2022. A moderation in bond yields, whose jump last year particularly pressured tech-stock valuations, is also likely helping the group, investors said.

Now, however, the focus is shifting to whether these companies can withstand a widely expected economic downturn while supporting valuations that some investors believe are too high.

""To keep this rebound going, the guidance for ’23 has to be less worse than what people are anticipating,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel, whose firm recently pared its holdings in Apple (AAPL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O).

Tech and growth stocks led U.S. equity markets for years following the 2008 financial crisis, aided by near-zero interest rates. They struggled along with broader markets last year as the Federal Reserve raised rates to fight surging inflation, and some investors doubt they will regain the market's pole position any time soon. The Nasdaq 100 fell 33% in 2022, while the S&P 500 lost 19.4%.

The top six stocks by market value in late 2021 - Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Amazon, Meta and Tesla (TSLA.O) - have seen their collective weight in the S&P 500 fall from 25% to 18%, according to Strategas Research Partners.

That dynamic echoes a pattern seen after the market’s dot-com bubble burst after the turn of the century. The six biggest stocks at that time saw their collective weight in the S&P 500 decline to 5% from a peak of 17% over a number of years, according to Strategas.

""This leadership unwind ... is going to be one that is measured in years, not in months or quarters,"" said Chris Verrone, head of technical and macro research at Strategas.

Megacap stocks as percentage of S&P 500

EARNINGS TEST

Companies comprising over half the S&P 500's market value are due to report results in the next two weeks, including Microsoft, the second-largest U.S. company by market value, on Tuesday, Elon Musk's Tesla and IBM (IBM.N) on Wednesday and Intel (INTC.O) on Thursday. Apple, the largest U.S. company by market value, and Google-parent Alphabet report the following week.

Fourth-quarter earnings in the tech sector are expected to have declined 9.1% from a year ago, compared to a 2.8% decline for S&P 500 earnings overall, according to Refinitiv IBES.

A critical question for many megacaps, once heralded for their stellar growth, is whether they can increase revenue and profits significantly while cutting costs in the face of a possible recession.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) said Friday it is cutting about 12,000 jobs, or 6% of its workforce, the latest tech giant to announce layoffs. Microsoft on Wednesday said it would eliminate 10,000 jobs while Amazon started notifying employees of its own 18,000-person job cuts.

""The biggest positive could be if they could show a control of expenses while keeping at least reasonable growth intact,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. ""It’s a hard balancing act.""

Valuations for tech and megacap companies have moderated after last year's selloff, though they still stand above those of the broader market. The S&P 500 tech sector still trades at a roughly 19% premium to the broader index, above its 7% average of the past 10 years, according to Refinitiv Datastream.

Nonetheless, some investors are reluctant to bet against tech stocks.

The Wells Fargo Investment Institute counts tech as one of its favored U.S. sectors.

The firm expects an economic downturn and believes many tech companies have businesses that are resilient to economic uncertainty, said Sameer Samana, a senior global market strategist there.

""It’s just too important and too big a weighting not to participate,"" Samana said. ""But the years of handily outperforming the S&P are probably now behind us.”

733,27,APPLE,2023-01-20,Apple appeals investigation by UK competition watchdog,"













LONDON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Technology giant Apple (AAPL.O) has filed an appeal against an investigation by Britain's competition watchdog into the dominance of its mobile browsers in the cloud gaming market.

Last November, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Britain's competition regulator, launched a full investigation into cloud gaming and mobile browsers on concerns about restrictions by iPhone-maker Apple and Google.

U.S. tech giants, including Google's owner Alphabet and Apple, are drawing increasing attention from competition regulators in Brussels, London and elsewhere.

Lawyers representing Apple said in a notice filed with the Competition Appeal Tribunal on Friday that the CMA's investigation should be reviewed. In its argument, lawyers said that the CMA had missed timing requirements linked to the launch of an investigation.

""Apple seeks 1) an Order that the MIR Decision is quashed. 2) a declaration that the MIR Decision and market investigation purportedly launched by reference to it are invalid and of no legal effect,"" the filing with the Appeal Tribunal showed.

Responding to the appeal, the CMA said on Friday it would defend its position and continue to progress its work in line with the statutory timetable.

""We opened this investigation to make sure that UK consumers get a better choice of mobile web services and that UK developers can invest in innovative mobile content and services,"" the CMA said in an emailed statement.

There is due to be a preliminary hearing on the matter on Tuesday, according to the Competition Appeal Tribunal website.

Jan 20 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday affirmed a decision to throw out a $308.5 million jury verdict against Apple Inc (AAPL.O) for allegedly infringing a patent related to digital rights management.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., upheld an East Texas federal judge's ruling that Personalized Media Communications LLC's patent was invalid because the company engaged in misconduct before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

PMC declined to comment on the decision. Representatives for Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

PMC, a patent licensing company, first sued Apple for infringing several patents in 2015. An East Texas jury said in August 2021 that the FairPlay software used in Apple's iTunes and App Store to decrypt movies, music and apps infringed one of the patents and awarded the company $308.5 million in damages.

District Judge Rodney Gilstrap overturned the verdict four months later. He said PMC's patent was unenforceable because the company had used a ""deliberate strategy of delay"" in applying for the patent, representing a ""conscious and egregious misuse of the statutory patent system.""

Gilstrap said PMC had used an improper ""submarine"" strategy that some applicants employed before 1995 to delay patents from becoming public until a market developed for their invention.

The Federal Circuit affirmed Gilstrap in a 2-1 ruling, finding that PMC's ""inequitable scheme to extend its patent rights"" had prejudiced Apple.

Court says pausing Samsung case for USPTO challenges would prejudice university















(Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co failed to convince an East Texas federal court on Friday to pause the California Institute of Technology's high-stakes patent lawsuit against it while it challenges the patents' validity at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

U.S. District Judge Rodney Gilstrap said halting the lawsuit until the Patent Trial and Appeal Board reviews the patents would unnecessarily delay the court case and prejudice Caltech.

Caltech had no comment on the decision. Representatives for Samsung and Caltech did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Caltech sued Samsung after it won a $1.1 billion California jury verdict in 2020 against Apple and Broadcom in a dispute over some of the same patents. A U.S. appeals court tossed the verdict last year and remanded for a new trial on damages.

The school's 2021 lawsuit alleges Samsung's Galaxy phones, tablets, watches and Wi-Fi-enabled Samsung products like televisions and refrigerators infringe its data-transmission patents.

Caltech has separately sued Microsoft, Dell and HP over the patents. Samsung challenged their validity at the USPTO last year.

Samsung asked the Texas court to freeze Caltech's case against it until the reviews finish, arguing the lawsuit was at an early stage and the PTAB decisions would simplify the issues.

But Gilstrap said Friday that pausing the case would ""do nothing more than draw out the time to trial,"" and that he could not determine whether the PTAB challenges would simplify the lawsuit because the board had not yet decided whether to hear them.

Gilstrap also said a pause would ""require the parties to sink additional resources into the case,"" which has already been going on for over a year, ""all the while postponing Caltech's vindication of its patent rights.""

The Texas case is scheduled to go to trial in September. The board's final decisions on patent validity would be due in November.

The case is California Institute of Technology v. Samsung Electronics Co, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, No. 2:21-cv-00446.

737,753,APPLE,2023-01-20,One thousand 'bad apples' placed outside London police HQ in demonstration,"













LONDON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - London police were confronted by the sight of 1,071 plastic rotten apples outside their headquarters on Friday, in a display seeking to mark the high number of staff facing investigation for sex offences or domestic abuse.

Refuge, a British domestic abuse charity, placed the imitation red and green apples outside the Metropolitan Police's New Scotland Yard building in central London, alongside a sign saying: ""1071 bad apples. How many more?""

The demonstration comes days after a serving London police officer admitted to 24 counts of rape in a campaign of abuse against women — news that appalled the nation and shone a light on the issue of falling public confidence in law enforcement.

In an effort to regain public trust, the Met police said on Tuesday it was investigating sexual and domestic abuse cases involving 1,071 officers and staff, and that hundreds were likely to be sacked as a result.

""This is not one bad apple; this is a systemic problem across policing,"" Refuge CEO Ruth Davison said. ""How have these perpetrators of abuse been allowed to enter and remain in positions of power for so long?""

""What happens next must change the culture of policing for good. A force which breeds violent misogyny is not a force which can even begin to protect women and girls.""

The Met, which has faced a string of scandals in recent years revealing a culture of corruption, racism and misogyny, is Britain's biggest police force with more than 43,000 staff and responsibility for issues such as terrorism and extradition.

Refuge has called for ""urgent and radical change"" and advocated for fast-track legislation to improve vetting and disciplinary standards across police forces and mandatory training for all officers on issues concerning violence against women.

A Met spokesperson said the force was aware of Friday's protest, and its officers had engaged with those involved to facilitate a peaceful demonstration. It said the protesters left at 1000 GMT and took the apples with them.

738,816,APPLE,2023-01-20,"Alphabet cuts 12,000 jobs after pandemic hiring spree, refocuses on AI","













Jan 20 (Reuters) - Google's parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) is cutting about 12,000 jobs as it faces ""a different economic reality"", it said in a staff memo, doubling down on artificial intelligence (AI) and axing staff who support experimental projects.

The job cuts affect 6% of its workforce, and follows thousands of layoffs at tech giants including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) who are downsizing after a pandemic-led hiring spree left them flabby in a weak economy.

Shares in Mountain View, California-based Alphabet, which boosted its workforce by nearly a third through 2020 and 2021, rose 4% on Friday. They had fallen 30% in the past 12 months, echoing a 24% slump in the broader tech industry (.IXIC).

Sundar Pichai, Alphabet's boss since 2019, said in the memo on Friday that he took ""full responsibility"" for the decisions that led to the layoffs.

Pichai, whose pay was recently tied more closely to performance, said this was a moment to ""sharpen our focus, reengineer our cost base and direct our talent and capital to our highest priorities,"" as Alphabet looked to get imbue its products with more AI, echoing comments from Microsoft that announced job cuts on Wednesday.

Alphabet, long a leader in AI, is facing competition from Microsoft, which is reportedly looking to boost its stake in ChatGPT - a promising chatbot that answers queries with human-like responses.

Advertising dollars, Alphabet's mainstay revenue source, meanwhile, is feeling the squeeze from businesses chopping budgets as consumers pull back spending.

""It is clear that Alphabet is not immune from the tough economic backdrop, with worries about a U.S. recession growing,"" said Susannah Streeter, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

""Ad growth has come off the boil ... Competition is also heating up, with Alphabet facing a powerful rival in TikTok, and Instagram also vying for its important YouTube viewers,"" Streeter said, noting that Alphabet has also racked up billions in regulatory fines.

Evercore ISIS analyst Mark Mahaney said Alphabet's record-high headcount had created major margin risk going into fiscal 2023 and Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik said the job cuts could save the company Alphabet $2.5 billion to $3 billion in costs.

BIG JOB CUTS

With Alphabet's staff cuts, layoffs at four of the biggest U.S. tech companies total 51,000 jobs in the past few months. They have fanned fears of a recession even as the U.S. job market remains tight.

""The tech sector is bit like the proverbial canary in the coal mine,"" said Stuart Cole, an economist at Equiti Capital, who believes the tech layoffs portend that the outlook for job security is finally beginning to turn more negative.

Apple (AAPL.O), which hired more prudently through the pandemic, has held off on cuts so far. On Friday, though, website AppleInsider reported citing sources that the iPhone maker had started to lay off non-seasonal employees in its retail channel in places such as Best Buy (BBY.N) stores.

Apple was not immediately available for a comment on the report.

Approximate number of people who lost or will be losing their jobs as announced by select companies

'LITTLE COMFORT'

Alphabet has been working on a major AI launch, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. One of the sources said it would take place in the spring. The New York Times also reported that Google planned to unveil more than 20 new products and a search engine including chatbot features.

Among those losing their jobs are recruiters, corporate staff and people working on engineering and product teams, Pichai said. Google has cut most jobs at Area 120, its in-house incubator for new projects, a company spokesperson told Reuters.

The Alphabet Workers Union said in a statement that the company's leadership taking ""full responsibility"" was ""little comfort.""

""It's appalling that our jobs are first on the chopping block so shareholders can see a few more points in a chart next quarter,"" the union said.

In the United States, where Alphabet has already emailed affected employees, staff would receive severance and six months of healthcare as well as immigration support.

Overseas, layoff notifications will take longer due to local employment laws and practices, Pichai said in the memo. Employees in Asia will learn starting in February if the reduction impacts them.

NEW DELHI, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) wants India to account for up to 25% of its production from about 5%-7% now, the trade minister told a conference on Monday, as the iPhone maker continues to move its manufacturing away from China.

""Apple, another success story,"" Piyush Goyal said, pitching India as a competitive manufacturing destination. ""They are already at about 5-7% of their manufacturing in India.

Goyal did not say when Apple wants to meet the target. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Cupertino, California-based Apple has bet big on India since it began iPhone assembly in the country in 2017 via Wistron (3231.TW) and later with Foxconn (2317.TW), in line with the Indian government's push for local manufacturing.

Foxconn plans to quadruple the workforce at its iPhone factory in India over two years, sources told Reuters late last year.

Ashwini Vaishnaw, Indian's electronics and information technology minister, tweeted on Monday that Apple's exports from India had hit $1 billion in December.

China's COVID-related lockdowns and restrictions, and rising trade and geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington, have influenced Apple's plans to shift production elsewhere.

J.P.Morgan analysts estimated last year that a quarter of all Apple products would be made outside China by 2025, from 5% currently.

Jan 23 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) was in talks with about half a dozen media partners including Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) to develop virtual reality (VR) content for its mixed reality headset, Bloomberg News reported on Monday.

Developed with Sony Group Corp (6758.T), the headset will have two ultra-high-resolution displays to handle the VR aspects and a collection of external cameras to enable an augmented reality ""pass-through mode"", the report said.

It added that the tech giant was working to update its own Apple TV+ material to work with the headset.

Disney, Apple and Sony did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that Apple was planning to unveil its first mixed reality (MR) headset this year.

MR is one of three types of extended reality technologies often associated with the metaverse. An MR headset could allow the wearer to use a real world object to trigger a virtual world reaction.

The iPhone maker's MR headset is set to launch in this year's spring event and will cost around $3,000, according to the report.

That would be twice as much as Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) Quest Pro virtual and MR headset, which waslaunched late last year for $1,500.

Jan 24 (Reuters) - Three people were killed in a shooting at a convenience store in central Washington state early Tuesday, police said, and the suspect has died after an hours-long manhunt.

Police were called to a Circle K in Yakima, Washington, about 3:30 a.m. when three people, who have not been identified, were found dead, Chief Matt Murray told reporters. Two victims were shot inside the store in what authorities said appeared to be a random act of violence, and a third was shot outside.

""It appears to be a random situation. There was no apparent conflict between the parties,"" Murray said. ""The male just walked in and started shooting.""

After opening fire in the store, the suspect, identified as Jarid Haddock, 21, ran across the street and fired into a vehicle, forcing the driver to move to the passenger seat. The suspect stole the car and fled, police said.

Following an hours-long manhunt, a relative of Haddock called authorities to a location behind warehouses where Haddock was hiding. Gunshots were heard while police approached and a man who identified himself as Haddock was found wounded, Murray said.

No officers were injured or used any force, he added.

Haddock died of his injuries at the scene.

Yakima is a city of about 97,000 people in Washington's Yamika Valley, an agricultural region known for apple crops and wineries.

NEW YORK, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Winter is well under way in New York City and the holiday celebrations are fading into the distance - but there has still not been a proper snowfall.

Central Park is green. The sun is out. And ducks frolic in ice-free ponds.

Although an epic blizzard hit western New York state just after Christmas, the Big Apple itself has gone 230 days without snow, according to the National Weather Service. It is now approaching the record latest snow for the city - Jan. 29, which dates back to 1973.

Some out in the park on Tuesday were perfectly happy about that.

""When it is snowing here and you're a visitor, it's beautiful... very pretty,"" said Melody Johnson, a regular visitor from Australia. ""But to walk through Central Park today, it's glorious.""

While there have been flurries, not enough has accumulated on the ground to meet the 0.1 inch threshold of what constitutes a snowfall.

According to Andrew Kruczkiewicz from Columbia University's Climate School and International Research Institute for Climate and Society, the delayed snowfall can be attributed both to rising temperatures related to climate change and natural variability.

But, he warned, winter is far from over.

""February is actually our snowiest month here in New York City, here in Central Park,"" Kruczkiewicz said. ""So, it is important to keep in mind things could change very quickly.""

743,376,APPLE,2023-01-24,Factbox: Biden administration continues Trump antitrust focus on tech giants,"













Jan 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department sued Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O) on Tuesday, marking the third antitrust lawsuit filed against a tech giant since the Trump administration kicked off investigations of the platforms and the Biden administration pledged to press on with the probes.

Following are major U.S. government lawsuits and investigations regarding Big Tech.

Google:

The U.S. Justice Department sued Google on Tuesday, accusing the company of abusing its dominance of the digital advertising business and saying Google should be forced to sell its ad manager suite, in the government's latest attempt to slice away a portion of Big Tech's power.

The U.S. Justice Department had previously sued Google in October 2020, accusing the $1 trillion company of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals in search. This case is scheduled to go to trial in September.

Dozens of U.S. states and territories filed a broader version of the Justice Department lawsuit in December 2020. The state complaint accuses Google of abusing its market power to try to make its search engine as dominant inside cars, TVs and speakers as it is in phones. The same judge is hearing both the federal and state lawsuits in D.C. federal court.

Also in 2020, Texas, backed by nine other states, filed a lawsuit against Google, accusing the internet search company of breaking antitrust law in how it runs its online advertising business. The case was moved to New York, to be heard with other, similar cases.

The Justice Department is also probing Google to determine if bundling its Maps product with other Google software illegally stifles competition.

Facebook:

The Federal Trade Commission and a big group of states filed separate lawsuits to ask a court to force Meta Platforms (META.O) to sell WhatsApp and Instagram, saying the social media company used a ""buy or bury"" strategy to snap up rivals and keep smaller competitors at bay. The judge threw out the state lawsuit on the grounds that they had waited too long to bring their case. The states have appealed while the FTC complaint goes forward.

Apple:

The Justice Department has a probe into Apple (AAPL.O) underway, which was revealed in June 2019. It appears to focus on Apple's app store. Some app developers have accused Apple of introducing new products very similar to existing apps created by other developers and sold in the Apple Store, and then trying to banish the older apps from the store because they compete with Apple's new product. Apple says it seeks to have only the highest-quality products in the app store.

Amazon:

In its investigation of Amazon (AMZN.O), the FTC is believed to be probing the inherent conflict of interest of Amazon competing with small sellers on its marketplace platform, including allegations that it used information from sellers on its platform to decide what products it would introduce.

744,516,APPLE,2023-01-25,Chevron pledges $75 bln for share buybacks as cash grows,"[1/2] The logo of Chevron is seen at the company's office in Caracas, Venezuela April 25, 2018. REUTERS/Marco Bello















Jan 25 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) on Wednesday said it would triple its budget for share buybacks to $75 billion, the oil industry's most ambitious shareholder payouts to date, as high oil and gas prices pad profits.

The oil industry has been facing calls from investors and the White House to put last year's record earnings from sky high energy prices into more drilling, acquisitions, or to reduce prices for consumers.

Chevron on Friday is expected to report profits for 2022 doubled to $37.2 billion, according to estimates by Refinitiv. It has budgeted $17 billion on new oil and gas projects this year, up $2 billion from last year.

Chevron's disclosure of the share buyback and a 6% increase in its quarterly shareholder dividend signaled it will allocate a big chunk of its profits to reward shareholders. It did not set a timetable for the buybacks.

Chevron and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) are poised to post record annual profits for 2022 of nearly $100 billion combined, analysts forecast.

Those unprecedented earnings led analysts at Citi on Wednesday to ask if one of the two might buy BP (BP.L), Shell (SHEL.L) or TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA).

U.S. oil producers overall are increasing their budgets for new energy projects this year, but the expenditures will be dwarfed by the amounts paid to shareholders.

The White House criticized the move in a statement. Last year the administration of President Joe Biden called for oil producers to instead invest in production to reduce energy prices for consumers and raise investments in renewable energy.

“For a company that claimed not too long ago that it was ‘working hard’ to increase oil production, handing out $75 billion to executives and wealthy shareholders sure is an odd way to show it,"" said White House spokesperson Abdullah Hasan.

The U.S. oil majors' valuations are about 40% above European rivals, Citi said. BP's market value is about $108 billion, compared to Chevron's $346 billion and Exxon's $466 billion.

Exxon Mobil, which led shareholder returns among oil majors last year, last month increased its buyback plan to $50 billion through 2024.

Chevron's buyback plan is smaller than those for large technology companies such as Apple. As of September, Apple has authorized $405 billion in buybacks and repurchased more than $90 billion in shares during the previous 12-month period.

Chevron shares rose almost 3% in after-market trade.

The energy industry last year was one of the top sectors in the S&P 500 index after trailing the broader market for years.

745,641,APPLE,2023-01-25,Google says U.S. Justice Department complaint is 'without merit',"













Jan 25 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google said on Wednesday it believes the complaint from the U.S. Department of Justice accusing the company of abusing its dominance in digital advertising is ""without merit"".

The company also added it will ""defend itself vigorously"".

The government on Tuesday said Google should be forced to sell its ad manager suite, tackling a business that generated about 12% of Google's revenue in 2021 while also playing a vital role in the search engine and cloud company's overall sales.

Google, which depends on its advertising business for about 80% of its revenue, said the government was ""doubling down on a flawed argument that would slow innovation, raise advertising fees and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow.""

The federal government has said its Big Tech investigations and lawsuits are aimed at leveling the playing field for smaller rivals who are up against a group of powerful companies that include Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (META.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

""In contrast with prior cases/investigations against Google's ad tech biz, we view the DOJ complaint as fairly substantive and preempting some potential Google lines of defense,"" said Wells Fargo analyst Brian Fitzgerald.

Summary Companies Q4 net revenue $4.42 bln vs forecast $4.32 bln

Q4 diluted EPS $1.32 vs forecast $1.09

Sees 2023 revenue of $16.8-$17.8 bln vs 2022's $16.1 bln

Shares jump as much as 9% to one-year high















LONDON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - European chipmaker STMicroelectronics beat fourth-quarter sales and earnings expectations on Thursday, as strong demand from automotive and industrial customers helped it cope with challenging economic conditions.

Shares in the company, whose clients include iPhone maker Apple (AAPL.O) and electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA.O), jumped as much as 9% to a one-year high of 43.10 euros as it hit its 2022 revenue target of $16.1 billion.

Citing strong demand and increased manufacturing capacity, CEO Jean-Marc Chery said STMicro expected 2023 revenue of $16.8 billion to $17.8 billion - putting it well on course for its target of $20 billion by 2027.

Rival Texas Instruments (TXN.O) forecast first-quarter revenue and profit below Wall Street targets on Wednesday.

""Good numbers across the board"", said Paul Allison, an analyst at investment platform Finimize of STMicro's performance. But he warned demand from the automotive industry might stagnate in 2023.

""The auto industry is strong, but it's hard to know how long that will last,"" he said. ""If we are heading into a recession, you'd expect demand for cars to struggle, but personal electronics may see an upturn.""

STMicro's net revenue rose to $4.42 billon in the fourth quarter from $4.32 billion the previous quarter. Analysts had on average expected sales of $4.32 billion, IBES data from Refinitiv Eikon showed.

Fourth-quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.32 beat analysts' average estimate of $1.09, IBES data showed.

STMicro said capital spending was $3.52 billion in 2022, and it planned to raise that to about $4 billion this year, primarily to increase manufacturing capacity.

Fourth-quarter net income rose to $1.25 billion, up 12% from the previous quarter.

747,531,APPLE,2023-01-26,South Africa's power cuts leave fruit farmers in despair,"Summary Deciduous fruit farmers worried over exports

Power cuts affecting irrigation, cold storage

Financial losses likely as outages continue















CERES, South Africa, Jan 26 (Reuters) - On the cusp of harvesting this season's first fruit, South African deciduous farmer Heinie du Toit frets as the worst power cuts on record threaten to take the shine off his apple and pear crop destined for foreign markets.

Situated in Ceres, one of the country's major fruit growing regions around 120km (75 miles) north east of Cape Town, the century-old family farm ""Remhoogte"" needs a steady electricity supply for an automated irrigation pump network that sprays thousands of trees heavy with fruit.

Too little water during the irrigation peak, from end of November to mid-March, affects the size and quality of a wide variety of apple and pear cultivars, hitting produce and revenue as only premier grades are shipped to the European Union, UK, China and the Middle East.

""The trees have a certain need for water and if they don't get that water it's going to affect the quality negatively and then you can't export the fruit,"" Du Toit said.

A 10% reduction in exports from the farm may result in some 7.5 million rand ($435,600) lost revenue, Du Toit said, with lower grades destined for the domestic market and juice processors.

Daily power outages, which utility Eskom anticipates would continue for two more years at least, have hammered economic growth, fuelling widespread discontent among businesses and households.

""Many farmers said this is their last chance and if something doesn't happen very quickly they are going to sell their farms ... It is a huge concern,"" Du Toit said as the steady throb of a diesel generator kicked in.

The fruit industry wasn't the only one feeling the squeeze.

REUTERS/Esa Alexander 1 2 3 4 5

Roughly 20% of maize, 15% of soybeans, 34% of sugarcane and nearly half of South Africa's wheat production was under irrigation, said Wandile Sihlobo, chief economist at the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa, adding farmers had raised concerns about power cuts hitting output.

""IMPOSSIBLE TO FARM""

Cape Town vegetable farmer Carl Gorgens has given up on about half of his farming area because he cannot irrigate as frequently as needed.

""It's impossible to farm like this, to farm half the amount of seedlings in a season, when you're supplying supermarkets. I might as well stop and close the doors,"" said Gorgens.

Power outages are the latest setback following a drought, the COVID-19 pandemic, bottlenecks at ports and higher commodity prices, such as fuel and fertilizer, due to the Russia-Ukraine war, Du Toit said.

At the Bella Frutta fruit exporters' packaging warehouse in Ceres, two massive diesel generators help keep conveyor belts moving and cold storage units at -1.5 degrees Celsius.

Earlier in January, the pack house burnt through 5,000 litres of diesel in just under three days to keep operations running.

""We struggle to keep a constant cooling supply to our cold rooms,"" said Fransu Viljoen, engineering manager at Bella Frutta, adding it was frustrating to get up before the crack of dawn to reset the generators.

Jan 26 (Reuters) - A landmark lawsuit by the U.S. Justice Department against Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google over its dominance of advertising technology could help rivals and websites that sell ad space, but leaves an uncertain future for the advertisers themselves, experts told Reuters.

The Justice Department's complaint against Google on Tuesday called for the company to divest Google Ad Manager, a suite of tools including one that lets websites put ad space up for a sale and another that served as an ad marketplace that automatically matched advertisers with those publishers.

If the Justice Department lawsuit succeeds, ""advertisers and publishers could have more leverage with more options with expanding players – and consequently more competition,"" said Neil Begley of Moody's Investors Service.

Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which is steadily growing its nascent advertising business and promoting it as privacy-focused, could be a winner if Google ads become less effective, said Brian Mandelbaum, chief executive of ad tech company Attain.

Ad industry executives say Google's business in placing ads on websites it does not own gives Google valuable information on an ad's effectiveness.

Apple has ""an ability to be a new dominant force,"" in advertising because Apple has data through its ownership of phones, its Safari web browser and the distribution of apps through the App Store, he said.

Google's competitors in ad tech are increasingly creating products that serve both the publishers like news websites, which sell ad space, and advertisers who buy ads, like Google currently does, said Paul Bannister, chief strategy officer at CafeMedia, which helps small and medium-sized publishers sell ad space.

If Google is forced to divest the tools that serve publishers, it would benefit competitors like Xandr, which is owned by Microsoft (MSFT.O), that will still work with both sides of the ad-buying ecosystem, Bannister said.

With more options besides Google, publishers will have more transparency over how much they can sell ad space for, and could end up paying less in fees, Mandelbaum said.

If successful, the lawsuit could be ""the beginning of serious business model changes for Google,"" said Paul Gallant, managing director at Cowen Washington Research Group.

The divested assets could result in Google losing key data that helps target ads to relevant consumers, he said.

If Google loses access to data signals, advertisers could see their Google ads become less effective, said Nikhil Lai, senior analyst at research firm Forrester.

At least twice before, the government has filed lawsuits against dominant companies with far-reaching results. A lawsuit breaking up AT&T, filed in 1974, resulted in an agreement in 1982 to break up the company. That breakup has been credited with a host of innovations in telephony.

The Justice Department's lawsuit against Microsoft, filed in 1998, reined in the company at a time when it was seeking to extend its dominant operating system to the internet browser. While the lawsuit settled, the fight is credited with opening the way for other internet innovators, like Google itself.

750,739,APPLE,2023-01-27,IPR tricks of the trade: changes to expect at the USPTO in 2023,"Law firms Haynes and Boone, LLP Follow















January 27, 2023 - On April 5, 2022, after more than one year without a Senate-confirmed Director, Kathi Vidal was confirmed as the new Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. She got to work right away.

Director Vidal first issued a binding Guidance memorandum that clarified the Patent Trial and Appeal Board's application of the controversial Fintiv factors for discretionary institution to deny a petition for inter partes review or post-grant review of a patent involved in parallel litigation in federal district court or the International Trade Commission (Fintiv Guidance). In May 2020, the PTAB designated as precedential Apple Inc. v. Fintiv, Inc., IPR2020-00019, Paper 11 (""Fintiv""), which sets forth several factors PTAB judges consider when deciding to exercise discretion to deny institution of a petition if the challenged patent is involved in parallel litigation. The immediate impact of this Fintiv Guidance was a sharp drop in the number of Fintiv-based denials.

Director Vidal also granted director review in 11 cases, 10 of which were taken sua sponte, to address various issues including abuse of the IPR process. This review is in response to the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Arthrex, Inc., 141 S. Ct. 1970 (2021). In Arthrex, the Court held that PTAB judges were unconstitutionally issuing final decisions on behalf of the USPTO without the ability for the Director to potentially alter or reverse the decisions before they became the final decisions of the agency. Vidal's decisions have provided clarity and transparency in the PTAB's post-grant review operations.

And, under Vidal's oversight, the USPTO published a request for comments seeking public input on the interim director review process.

Simply put, 2022 was a big year for the USPTO. The authors believe, however, that there will be more significant changes in PTAB operations in 2023. Director Vidal's efforts initiated in 2022 will come to fruition in 2023 and are expected to provide even more clarity and transparency in PTAB adjudications.

Codification of the Fintiv guidance

Director Vidal's Fintiv Guidance stated that the PTAB may not discretionarily deny a petition under Fintiv when:

(1) the petition presents compelling evidence of unpatentability;

(2) the request for discretionary denial is based on a parallel ITC proceeding; or

(3) the petitioner stipulates not to pursue in a parallel district court proceeding invalidity grounds that the petitioner raised or reasonably could have raised in the petition (i.e., a Sotera-type stipulation).

The immediate result of the Fintiv Guidance is the drop-off of Fintiv denials. Indeed, some analysts note that the PTAB has relied on Fintiv only twice to deny institution since the director's Fintiv Guidance was published. Needless to say, this change in landscape is a welcome respite for opponents of the Fintiv factors.

Proponents of the Fintiv factors are similarly surprised about the immediate impact of the Fintiv Guidance. Some stakeholders have asked for a solution that is more formal than a ""binding"" Guidance.

Luckily, the Fintiv Guidance concludes with the admonition that it is merely an interim guidance and that the USPTO ""expects to replace [the guidance]…with rules after [the USPTO] has completed formal rulemaking."" (Fintiv Guidance at 9.) It is therefore reasonable to expect the USPTO to ""explore potential rulemaking on proposed approaches through an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking"" in 2023.

Formalization of the director review process

On July 20, 2022, the USPTO published a Request for Comments on the post-Arthrex director review process. The request seeks comments on the scope of director review, i.e., whether it should be limited to final written decisions of the PTAB or permit the director to sua sponte review any decision of the PTAB including institution decisions and decisions on rehearing. It also seeks comments on the current Precedential Opinion Panel (POP) process.

It is expected that in 2023 the USPTO will complete its review and analysis of the multitude of public comments and promulgate a rules package in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Stakeholders have requested clarity in this area. At the moment, there appears to be three competing processes for requesting review of a PTAB final written decision. A party can, of course, request rehearing by the PTAB panel under 37 C.F.R. § 42.71. The party can also seek director review as an alternative to a request for rehearing. Alternatively, the party can request review by the Precedential Opinion Panel (POP) under the PTAB's Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) 2.

When it comes to other PTAB decisions, such as decisions on whether to institute trial, all three mechanisms remain available in one form or another. A party can file a request for rehearing of any PTAB decision and similarly recommend POP review. The director, in turn, may sua sponte review any PTAB decision as part of the director review process or may convene the POP for the same purpose. However, at present, a party cannot request director review of a decision on institution.

If the number of available options wasn't confusing, consider this: The director is a party to two of these procedural mechanisms. The director is clearly the one reviewing a PTAB decision as part of the director review process. The director is also a member of the POP. (SOP 2 at 4.) One obvious question is when one mechanism is more appropriate to use than another and, where the director is at least one of the members rendering a decision, which mechanism is more precedential or binding.

Stakeholders are therefore hoping for greater clarity on these procedures in 2023.

Court decisions

Last but not least, the Supreme Court and the Federal Circuit have not been shy to offer their own views on PTAB policies and procedures. There is at least one case that is up for review in 2023 that may have a significant impact on PTAB practice.

In Apple Inc. v. California Institute of Technology, Case No. 22-203, Apple is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to resolve what invalidity grounds may be properly asserted by an unsuccessful PTAB petitioner against the same patent in district court litigation.

USPTO goals

In early January 2023, the USPTO published a draft version of its 2022-2026 Strategic Plan. One of the USPTO's goals is to continue to ""promote inclusive innovation."" The USPTO plans to further this goal by improving access to counsel and offer assistance with procuring patent protection through partner pro bono services and law school clinic programs.

The USPTO has also seen success with its Legal Experience and Advancement Program (LEAP). The program aims to give less experienced attorneys extra oral argument time so that the attorney may be fully able to represent their clients' needs. The authors expect that 2023 will see the publication of the USPTO's final 2022-2026 Strategic Plan and possibly the introduction of additional programs that are intended to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion in USPTO practice.

751,329,APPLE,2023-01-30,Apple's India supplier Jabil making AirPods parts for export-Bloomberg,"













Jan 29 (Reuters) - Apple-supplier Jabil Inc's (JBL.N) India unit has begun making components for AirPods in the country and is shipping plastic bodies or enclosures for AirPods to China and Vietnam, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Jabil did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The move marks another step in Apple's plans to shift its manufacturing away from China amid rising trade and geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington.

The iPhone maker wants India to account for up to 25% of its production, from about 5%-7% now.

Apple has bet big on India since it began iPhone assembly in the country in 2017, in line with the Indian government's push for local manufacturing.

752,552,APPLE,2023-01-30,Taiwan export orders seen contracting at faster pace in Dec - Reuters poll,"Summary

Summary Companies For poll data click:

Orders median forecast -25.6% y/y (prior month -23.4%)

Data due Tuesday, Jan. 31, 4:00 p.m. (0800 GMT)















TAIPEI, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Taiwan's export orders likely contracted again in December and at a faster clip than the previous month, a Reuters poll showed on Monday, as global demand for the island's technology-related goods continues to cool.

The median forecast from a poll of 13 economists was for export orders to fall by 25.6% from a year earlier. Forecasts ranged for a contraction of between 16.3% and 30%.

Taiwan's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, fell by a worse-than-expected 23.4% in November.

The government last month predicted December's export orders would be between 27.8% and 30.8% lower than those reported a year earlier.

Taiwan's export orders are a leading indicator of demand for high-tech gadgets and Asian exports, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months.

The island's manufacturers, including the world's largest contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW), , are a key part of the global supply chain for technology giants including Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

The data for December will be released on Tuesday.

753,490,APPLE,2023-01-31,"Mobile phone, PC shipments to fall again in 2023, Gartner says","













STOCKHOLM, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Shipments of personal computers and mobile phones are expected to fall for the second straight year in 2023, with phone shipments slumping to a decade low, IT research firm Gartner said on Tuesday.

Mobile phone shipments are projected to fall 4% to 1.34 billion units in 2023, down from 1.40 billion units in 2022, Gartner said. Theytotaled 1.43 billion in 2021.

That was close to the 2009 shipments level when Blackberry and Nokia phones were the market leaders as Apple tried to dent their dominance. The mobile phone market peaked in 2015 when shipmentstouched 1.9 billion units.

The pandemic led to a fundamental change where people working from home didn't feel the need to change phones frequently, Ranjit Atwal, research director at Gartner, said in an interview.

""Consumers are holding onto their phones longer than expected, from six to nine months, and moving away from fixed to flexible contracts in the absence of meaningful new technology,"" he said.

The demand for smartphones and PCs initially rose during the pandemic, but started to weaken in the middle of the last year.

Rising global interest rates and cost of living have dampened demand for smartphones, hitting companies ranging from Samsung (005930.KS) to Apple (AAPL.O).

Personal computer shipments are expected to slide 6.8% this year after falling 16% in 2022, the research firm said. Lenovo (0992.HK), HP Inc (HPQ.N) and Dell (DELL.N) are the top three PC makers.

The slump in the devices market will slow in 2023 on expectations of a less pessimistic economic outlook through the year and eventual rise in consumer and business spending, Gartner said.

REUTERS/Sarah Meyssonnier/Files















LONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Europe's glittering luxury companies, the region's top stock-market performers in 2023, may see yet more gains driven by a rebound in Chinese spending, but for some the sector is starting to look expensive.

The likes of French luxury giant and Louis Vuitton-owner LVMH , and Swiss jewelry company Richemont (CFR.S), have benefited from the resilience of their wealthy customers against the cost-of-living crisis.

Since the start of 2023, China's decision to allow more normal activity and dismantle its strict COVID-19 restrictions has provided another boost for the sector.

An index of European luxury goods retailers (.dMIEU0TA00PUS) has rallied around 18% so far this year, outperforming the wider pan-European STOXX 600 (.STOXX), which is up 6.2% in the same time frame.

But the fact that luxury goods companies are not as cheap as they once were is a ""concern/point of attention"", said Kasper Elmgreen, Head of Equities at Amundi, Europe's largest asset manager.

""They’re much more fairly valued today, there is less that is perhaps undiscovered. The risk is that when something moves to being priced to perfection there is always a higher risk of disappointment.""

The price-to-earnings ratio of the MSCI Europe luxury index is around 26, while that of the broader STOXX is closer to 13, according to Refinitiv data.

European luxury has historically traded at a big premium relative to the broader market, but this has widened even further in recent years. At 23 times 12-month forward earnings, its current premium of 82% is almost twice as much as the 20-year average, according to Refintiv Datastream.

THE APPLE OF EUROPE'S EYE

LVMH, Europe's most valuable company by market capitalisation, has a PE ratio of around 30, while rival Hermes (HRMS.PA) has a valuation of almost 60, according to Refinitiv data. Apple (AAPL.O), the world's most valuable company, commands a PE ratio of around 23.

Jelena Sokolova, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said that China reopening is the key issue for European luxury stocks this year, and is already at least 50% priced in.

""Currently we don’t see this sector as undervalued anymore ... there were some opportunities last year, but they are fairly valued now, or a little too overvalued at the moment,” she said.

In a January research note, UBS analysts said 2023 was ""the year of the Chinese consumer for European luxury”, and highlighted Richemont, Hermes (HRMS.PA) and Italian luxury group Moncler (MONC.MI) as their top picks and ""the most balanced, high-quality plays on China re-opening"".

Ongoing concerns of recession, an expected fall in earnings expectations, and sky-high inflation mean the potential returns on luxury stocks could be a boon in what promises to be a difficult year for stock-pickers.

The ability to increase the price of products without losing customers has stood out as a key strength of Europe's luxury brands, and remains in focus for equity investors even as inflation on the continent eased in December.

""The things they sell don’t really depend on the price that they charge, with the average price of a product at Cartier of $10,000 whether it increases to $11,000 is neither here nor there,"" said Nick Clay, head of global equity income at investment manager Redwheel.

These shares have more room to run higher as Chinese consumers hit the shops again and luxury companies flex their pricing power. But with valuations already fairly lofty, investors question how much higher they can go.

LVMH's most recent earnings showed a 9% rise in organic sales in the fourth quarter as shoppers in Europe and the United States splurged over the holiday season, helping partly to offset COVID-19 disruptions in China.

But some analysts focused on the margins, taking some of the shine off the fourth-quarter sales boost. That said, it had little impact on the share price, which has risen by 600% in the last 10 years, compared with a 91% gain in the benchmark STOXX.

""Companies like LVMH have high quality businesses, they compound profits over long periods of time and deliver great returns for shareholders,"" said Mark Denham, head of European equities at French asset manager Carmignac.

""It is true that the ratings of these companies have risen so it becomes slightly more asymmetric, but over the long term earnings compounding is the dominant factor.”

755,52,APPLE,2023-01-31,"Apple workplace rules violate U.S. labor law, agency finds","













Jan 31 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) maintains workplace policies that unlawfully discourage employees from discussing working conditions, a U.S. labor agency has found.

The National Labor Relations Board will issue a complaint targeting the policies and claiming Apple executives made comments that stymied worker organizing unless the company settles first, an agency official said on Monday in an email reviewed by Reuters.

The official had sent the email to Ashley Gjovik, a former Apple senior engineering manager who filed complaints against the company in 2021.

The NLRB investigates charges filed by workers and unions and decides whether to issue formal complaints against companies. The agency can seek to strike down workplace policies and require employers to notify workers of legal violations.

Apple did not respond to a request for comment. The company has said it takes worker complaints seriously and thoroughly investigates them.

An NLRB spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Gjovik in an email on Tuesday said she hoped the development will spur more Apple workers to speak up about working conditions and to organize.

In her complaints, Gjovik said various Apple rules, including those relating to confidentiality and surveillance policies, deter employees from discussing issues such as pay equity and sex discrimination with each other and the media.

Gjovik also cited a 2021 email from Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook that allegedly sought to stop workers from speaking to the press and said ""people who leak confidential information do not belong here.""

Many tech companies have strict confidentiality policies designed to protect trade secrets.

U.S. labor law prohibits policies that could discourage workers from exercising their right to band together to improve working conditions.

Apple is facing several pending NLRB complaints, including one claiming the tech giant unlawfully required workers at an Atlanta retail store to attend anti-union meetings. Apple has denied wrongdoing.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/Files















Feb 1 (Reuters) - A rise in a key advertising metric for Snap Inc (SNAP.N) that reported an otherwise insipid quarter could bode well for Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O), analysts said on Wednesday.

Shares of the Snapchat owner fell 13% on a dour revenue forecast, which the company blamed on a weak economy and stiff competition. But Snap's direct response advertising business, which is key for market leaders Meta and Google, was a bright spot.

Sales from the business rose 4% in the fourth quarter, Snap said.

""Snap is impacted by the reality that it has significant brand advertising exposure (which is getting hit harder than direct response),"" said Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney.

Headwinds for Meta and Google could be notably less severe, he said.

Alphabet's Google, the world's largest digital advertising platform, has long fared better than other ad-dependent companies because brands deem ads on Google searches crucial to driving website visits or other consumer actions.

Meta has said the bulk of its revenue also comes from direct response advertising. Facebook and Instagram reach billions of users, turning them into a key part of the marketing strategies of many brands.

Snap's direct response performance was a more positive takeaway for Meta than Alphabet, said CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino, pointing to Meta's progress with measurement, optimization and artificial intelligence enhancements on its platform.

Snap performed worse than Meta, Alphabet and Pinterest in the past year

Snap's shares were trading at $10 on Wednesday. The company's weak outlook pulled down shares of Meta and Pinterest (PINS.N), which also earns revenue by selling digital advertising.

Analysts expect Meta to post a 6.5% fall in December-quarter revenue when it reports results later on Wednesday, its third consecutive quarter of decline, according to Refinitiv.

Alphabet will report results on Thursday, and analysts expect revenue to be unchanged from a year earlier.

Snap's challenges, including privacy changes on Apple Inc (AAPL.O) devices that have made it harder for marketers to collect data, are not unique to the company. But it has the ""added challenge of being a small player,"" said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence.

""Advertisers are turning to tried and true platforms.""

WASHINGTON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Wednesday unveiled fresh efforts to slash credit card late fees and drive down the prices that Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) charge on mobile app stores.

The move is part of a larger policy drive to promote competition in consumer markets, officials said.

Speaking at the White House, Biden also called on lawmakers to ban ""junk fees"" he said jacked up costs for consumer services such as accommodation, concert tickets, mobile plans and air travel, in which officials said air carriers can charge family members extra to be seated next to young children.

""The bottom line is these unfair fees add up. It's a basic question of fairness,"" Biden told reporters.

Biden has been beating the drum on inflation, criticizing Republicans who now control the House of Representatives for backing tax measures that he said would benefit the wealthy at the expense of middle-class taxpayers.

Biden, who is expected to announce a bid for re-election in the coming weeks, has also been slamming Republicans for their refusal to approve an increase in the U.S. debt ceiling unless there is a deal on spending cuts.

Wednesday's announcement coincides with a scheduled meeting between Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy that is likely to mark the start of protracted maneuvering on raising the $31.4 trillion borrowing cap.

As part of the initiative, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Wednesday proposed a rule to ban ""excessive"" fees that credit card issuers charge for late payments, something the bureau estimated costs consumers $12 billion a year.

Speaking at Biden's side, CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said such fees far exceeded any additional costs that lenders incurred.

""What I think we also see is companies using inflation as an excuse to raise fees even more and that is wrong,"" he said.

The CFPB said the rule would cap late fees at $8, whereas officials estimate they currently average $31, something that could represent as much as $9 billion in consumer savings a year.

The rule could take effect in 2024 after a comment period, according to Chopra. However, regulations are frequently subject to challenge and litigation by industry groups that can block or delay them.

The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), an arm of the Commerce Department, released a report on Wednesday denouncing the market dominance enjoyed by Apple and Google in the app economy, where the vast majority of smartphone users and developers are hemmed inside the tech giants' software ecosystems, which the NTIA said drives up costs and limits innovation.

The report calls for greater user control over which applications are available, an end to platform operators' ""self-preference"" for their own apps, and a ban on requirements that apps use the operators' in-app payments systems.

An Apple spokesperson said in a statement that while the report ""acknowledges the importance of user privacy, data security and user convenience,"" some of its conclusions ""ignore the investments we make in innovation, privacy and security.""

Google also disagreed with the report's findings, saying through a spokesperson that its Android system ""enables more choice and competition than any other mobile operating system.""

Meanwhile, the White House said Wednesday the Transportation Department will propose regulations to bar airlines from charging family members to be seated next to children age 13 or younger and will disclose on a government dashboard which airlines do not charge such fees, the White House said.

Wednesday's announcements will mark the fourth meeting of Biden's Competition Council, created in 2021 when consumer inflation was at 40-year highs and was widely seen as a political headwind ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.

758,242,APPLE,2023-02-01,Apple distributor Redington's Q3 profit falls as costs outpace topline growth,"













CHENNAI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Redington (India) Ltd (REDI.NS), the country's biggest Apple and IT products distributor, reported a 2% fall in third-quarter profit on Wednesday, as ballooning expenses countered record revenue.

For Redington, which distributes electronic products made by Apple (AAPL.O) and Dell (DELL.N) among others, consolidated profit slipped to 3.8 billion rupees ($46.4 million) for the quarter ended Dec. 31.

Companies across the globe have had to battle higher transportation and raw material costs as the Russia-Ukraine war led to an increase in the prices of several major commodities.

Redington's expenses rose about 32% to 212.2 billion rupees, narrowly outpacing a near-31% jump in revenue from operations to a record 216.74 billion rupees.

The company said revenue from Singapore, India and South Asia (SISA) increased nearly 29%, while that from the rest of the world, including the Middle East, Turkey, and Africa, rose around 32%.

Chennai-based Redington's topline went up even as the gadget distributor cautioned demand for remote-working equipment likely declined with people gradually returning to offices.

High inflation and interest rates as well as weaker currencies in markets where Redington operates posed further challenges.

Redington shares, which rose 25% in 2022 and 2% last month, closed over 1% lower at 182.65 rupees on Wednesday.

759,228,APPLE,2023-02-01,Apple set to post rare revenue drop as focus shifts to demand rebound,"













Feb 1 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is expected to report its first decline in quarterly revenue in nearly four years after strict COVID-19 curbs in China rapped the economy and related protests upended iPhone production at its biggest supplier Foxconn (2317.TW).

Investors will look for details on how Chief Executive Tim Cook is trying to bolster demand in a weak economy that has prompted mass layoffs in the tech industry, a move Apple has so far avoided thanks to frugal hiring during the pandemic.

""With supply chain challenges largely normalized, we now believe Apple is entering a period of slower demand due to macro factors,"" said Cowen analyst Krish Sankar, adding that he expects 2% fewer iPhone units to be sold in 2023.

The world's biggest public company is expected to report on Thursday that iPhone sales fell about 5% for the all-important holiday quarter, according to Refinitiv. The last time iPhone sales slipped was in the August-October period in 2020, months into the COVID-19 pandemic.

Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics

UBS analysts expect iPhone sales to have held up better in the United States than China and Europe, as the economies reeled from the impact of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war.

Some demand for the iPhone will likely be pushed into the current quarter after supply restrictions in the first quarter and some demand lost due to lack of product availability in the holiday period, BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan said.

The services business, a key growth engine for the company and home to Apple's music and video streaming services, is set to post its lowest revenue growth for the holiday quarter - another fallout of consumers limiting spending.

Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics

THE CONTEXT

The disruption at the world's biggest iPhone plant in Zhengzhou, China triggered a rare warning from Apple in November and limited stocks of its higher-end iPhone 14 models during what is typically its biggest sales quarter, powered by product launches and the holidays.

Greater China, including Hong Kong, is key to Apple's fortunes, contributing roughly a fifth to annual revenue. The Cupertino, California-based tech behemoth had in 2019 pared its total sales forecast due to an economic slowdown in the country following the Sino-U.S. trade war.

Analysts, however, expect a much-faster recovery this time as factories have restarted in China and Apple diversifies its production footprint with plants in India.

""Commentary from luxury goods companies indicates China is rebounding quickly, which implies Mar-qtr Chinese iPhone sales should be better than expected,"" Evercore ISI analysts said in a note.

FUNDAMENTALS

** Revenue estimated to have fallen 2% in the last three months of 2022, Apple's first fiscal quarter.

** IPhone sales likely fell for first time since 2020, while services business rose 6%.

** Analysts expect net income to have dropped 10.4%; earnings per share of $1.94

760,2,APPLE,2023-02-02,Apple tries to be both desirable and predictable,"













NEW YORK, Feb 2 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Companies from General Electric (GE.N) to Goldman Sachs (GS.N) know one key to a higher stock-market valuation is producing recurring, stable, fee-like revenue. The same goes for Apple (AAPL.O). The $2.4 trillion iPhone maker’s shift from devices to less tangible services, which made up 18% of its revenue in the latest quarter, has pushed up its valuation. But not all of its offerings are equally valuable.

As Apple has shifted toward more services, its desirability has risen. In 2018, the company’s enterprise value was equivalent to 3 times estimated revenue for the year ahead, according to Refinitiv. Today, at $2.5 trillion including net debt, Chief Executive Tim Cook presides over a firm valued at 6 times sales.

One way to make sense of that is to break Apple’s valuation into parts. Analysts assume Apple will sell about $300 billion in iPhones and other objects this year. While the devices have changed, the business hasn’t much, so assume that chunk of business is worth around 5 times sales – still handsomely above Apple’s historical average – or around $1.5 trillion. Deduct that from Apple’s enterprise value, and investors are pricing the services business at $1 trillion, around 10 times forecast revenue.

That’s more than Microsoft (MSFT.O), which trades at 8 times and whose revenue growth is similar and remarkably consistent. Whether it’s justified, though, depends on what services Apple is peddling, and how steady and subscription-like they are. Gaming and advertising, for example, may become blockbuster businesses, but are more impacted by economic weakness than music subscriptions or cloud backup.

Apple doesn’t break out how much revenue comes from what source, but it matters. Cyclical services are typically valued less richly, even if they are growing quickly. Alphabet (GOOGL.O), the ad-dependent parent of Google, and gaming company Electronic Arts (EA.O) are both valued at 4 times estimated sales. If 20% of Apple’s services are cyclical, for example, and investors put the same multiple of sales as those peers, the company's fair share price drops 5%.

That may sound like splitting hairs. But it isn’t, because services are an ever-greater part of Apple’s business: nearly a fifth of revenue today compared with less than 10% in 2015. Apple might be reluctant to disclose more, since regulators like European antitrust cop Margrethe Vestager are out to inject competition into digital markets. But if there’s one thing investors prize along with predictability, it’s transparency.

761,88,APPLE,2023-02-02,"Apple forecasts another drop in revenue, proclaims iPhone production problems over","













Feb 2 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Thursday forecast that revenue would fall for a second quarter in a row but that iPhone sales were likely to improve as production had returned to normal in China after COVID-related shutdowns.

While striking an optimistic tone on sales of services and iPhones, CEO Tim Cook said an uncertain economy is expected to hurt categories like gaming and digital advertising.

Overall, Apple's leaders tried to reassure investors that despite the firm being buffeted by up-and-down sales cycles for its flagship device and vulnerable to supply chain shocks, the world's largest listed company remains on a steady - if somewhat slower - rise. And in the immediate aftermath of some of the company's worst financial results in years, at least some investors seemed to give Cook the benefit of the doubt, imposing only modest share price declines.

For the just-ended quarter, Apple's profits missed Wall Street expectations for the first time since 2016, dragged down by iPhone sales falling for the first time since 2020.

The stock was down about 2% after Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said that iPhone sales were likely to improve compared with the quarter ended Dec. 31. That did not quite erase a 3.7% gain during regular trade.

Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) also fell about 4% after reporting results. They also had gained during regular trade.

SALES, PROFITS MISS EXPECTATIONS

Apple sales fell 5% to $117.2 billion and were down in every part of the world in the quarter. Sales from each product category dropped, except for gains in services and iPads. Earnings per share were $1.88.

Analysts had expected sales of $121.1 billion and profits of $1.94 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. In an interview, Cook told Reuters that the production disruptions that plagued Apple's key quarter were now over.

""Production is now back where we want it to be,"" he said.

During its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 31, Apple faced a wave of challenges that left Wall Street expecting lower sales. Chief among those were supply chain pressures when COVID lockdowns at a production facility in Zhengzhou, China, slowed production of iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max devices, both premium priced models that would traditionally help drive Apple's margins higher.

Cook said the lockdowns in China created a dual challenge where both supply and demand were constrained, with greater China sales falling 7% to $23.9 billion.

But product snags are behind Apple now. ""They still feel demand will be soft, but they've rectified production, which means that if demand does go up unexpectedly, they can ramp"" to meet it, said Ben Bajarin of analyst firm Creative Strategies.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE HEADWINDS

The strong U.S. dollar also hurt Apple, which derives more than half its sales from outside the Americas, but the effect was less than anticipated as the dollar eased from last year's highs. Apple had warned investors that such foreign-exchange issues would put a 10% on drag on sales but said on Thursday that the actual effect was 8%. Apple expects a 5% impact for foreign exchange rates in the fiscal second quarter.

""I would point out that 8% is still a very severe headwind,"" Cook told Reuters. ""I wouldn't want to underestimate that. We would have grown on a constant currency basis.""

On top of supply chain problems for the iPhone, Wall Street analysts had expected iPhone sales to fall this year as part of a larger pattern in which the iPhone 14 family released last year sells more slowly after two straight years of strong sales of iPhone 12 and 13 models. Apple said iPhone sales were $65.8 billion, down 8% from the year before and the first fall since 2020.

Reuters Graphics

ONLY TWO GROWTH SEGMENTS

Only two segments grew. The company's services segment, which includes content businesses such as Apple TV+ and software business like the App Store, rose 6% to $20.8 billion in revenue. And sales of the iPad were up 30% to $9.4 billion, compared with analyst expectations of $7.8 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

""The report was not good. The guidance wasn't great either. But it doesn't seem to matter. This market has just a relentless 'buy the dip' mentality,"" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Triple D Trading who does not have a position in Apple stock.

Cook told Reuters that the company now has a base of 2 billion active devices, up from 1.8 billion a year ago. The company now has 935 million paid subscriptions, up from 900 million the quarter before, and that services sales set a record in several markets, including China, he said.

Sales of the company's Mac computers, which had boomed during the wave of working from home during the pandemic, declined 29% year over year to $7.7 billion. The wearables and accessories segment, which includes the Apple Watch and AirPods, fell 8% to $13.5 billion.

762,600,APPLE,2023-02-02,"Morning Bid: Fed fillip, double trouble, triple A","













A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.

It looks less like fighting the Fed, than a mild disagreement.

As the Federal Reserve slowed the pace of its interest rate rates on Wednesday to a quarter point, but with a promise of more, Wall St surged - comforted by Chair Jerome Powell's reluctance to loudly protest market pricing for peak rates by June, and easing by year-end.

Powell didn't endorse that market view - which now has just one more quarter point rise to a terminal rate under 4.9% by May and 40 basis points of cuts from there by December. But he seemed ambivalent about investors' more optimistic take on disinflation and indicated the central bank was increasingly keeping its options open about a 'couple of hikes'.

""We can now say for the first time that the disinflationary process has started,"" Powell told reporters, adding he was ""not particularly concerned"" about market pricing - when many have expected him to push back harder to stymie a premature easing of broader financial conditions.

With the U.S. labour market a key ingredient in how the Fed sees the disinflation process playing out, a notable slowing in private sector hiring last month will encourage speculation for similar easing of the super-tight jobs market in Friday's release of the January national payrolls report.

Aided by a quarterly refunding schedule and some tentative signs of compromise on the debt ceiling row, 10-year Treasury yields dropped more than 10bp to less than 3.40%. The dollar swooned , falling to its lowest since April last year.

By the close, the S&P 500 (.SPX) and Nasdaq (.IXIC) added 1% and 2% respectively and stock futures are extending that rally early on Thursday - helped by a near 20% rocketing of Meta's share price (META.O) after the bell.

Meta's stock boomed as its earnings update showed stricter cost controls and a new $40 billion share buyback.

The wave of optimism comes as Big Tech trio Apple, Amazon and Alphabet report after the close on Thursday.

The VIX index (.VIX) of U.S. stock volatility fell to its lowest level in more than a year.

The dovish take on the Fed now gets a potentially more hawkish follow-up from the European Central Bank and Bank of England - both of whom are forecast to stick with half point interest rate rises later on Thursday.

With the risk around the BoE's split monetary policy council for a smaller quarter point move, it was the euro that looks set to emerge the winner of the three big central bank events. The euro/dollar exchange rate hit its highest in nine-months.

And in a reminder of how new year optimism doesn't necessarily lift all boats, the rout in India's giant Adani conglomerate deepened.

Adani market losses swelled to more than $100 billion on Thursday - sparking worries about country-wide investment contagion a day after its flagship company abandoned a $2.5 billion stock offering. It's battling a short seller attack on the firm's bonds amid questions over the group's leverage and growing doubts about margin financing.

Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Thursday:

* European Central Bank and Bank of England policy decisions

* US Q4 Unit Labor Costs, productivity; weekly jobless claims

* U.S. corp earnings: Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Ford, Starbucks Clorox, Qualcomm, Gilead, Conocophillips, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Honeywell, Estee Lauder, CMS, Intercontinental Exchange, Merck, Hershey, WW Grainger, Illinois Tool Works, etc

763,675,APPLE,2023-02-02,Goldman’s Marcus is a lesson in self-made failure,"













NEW YORK, Feb 2 (Reuters Breakingviews) - If David Solomon is taking the blame for the demise of Goldman Sachs’ (GS.N) upstart digital bank, it’s partly by accident. Almost all the other executives who publicly championed the project known as “Marcus by Goldman Sachs” departed the $120 billion Wall Street bank long ago. Even so, with the firm now on the back foot, and Solomon’s pay last year cut by 30%,it falls to the boss to try and recover lost ground.

Being a consumer bank was a good idea when Goldman’s leaders cooked it up eight years ago. They already had a banking licence, a huge balance sheet, and experience dealing with finnicky regulators. By offering unsecured loans and savings accounts, then-finance chief Marty Chavez explained in 2017, Goldman could make a return on equity in the mid-teens, more than enough to justify its investment.

Fast forward to 2023, and consumer banking is still highly lucrative. The giant retail arms of JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Bank of America (BAC.N) both make a return on equity of around 35%. Yet Goldman last month shelved its bid to be a retail powerhouse. It will stick to running credit cards for companies such as Apple (AAPL.O) and General Motors (GM.N), offering online savings products and making buy-now-pay-later loans. The long-awaited Marcus checking account will only be available for VIPs. Solomon calls this a “narrowing.” Really, it’s a climbdown.

Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics

The roots of Goldman’s failure are the same as its initial success: people. Lloyd Blankfein, who as Solomon’s predecessor launched Marcus, recognized that Goldman bankers weren’t experts in consumer finance. So he brought in specialists like former Discover Financial Services (DFS.N) executive Harit Talwar, to join long-term Goldman folks like Stephen Scherr, later the firm’s chief financial officer, and Omer Ismail. They got capital, Goldman’s risk and compliance apparatus, and freedom to try new things, including wearing Converse sneakers to work.

Before long, tensions mounted. One source of discord, according to multiple people familiar with the situation, was the Wall Street pay structure. Goldman tends to reward managing directors generously, but more junior vice presidents would graft for sometimes one-quarter of the rewards and the hope of future promotion. The practice of working through the night is common in the investment banking division Solomon once headed but rare in consumer banking. Projects for demanding partners like Apple magnified the workload.

Goldman’s inherent sense of superiority also proved a mixed blessing. The firm decided to build rather than buy, since history suggested that was a way to avoid the painful clash of cultures arising from mergers like Citicorp’s union with Travelers, or Morgan Stanley’s (MS.N) with Dean Witter. But it also resulted in laboriously reinventing the wheel. For example, Goldman’s engineers had to fight to host consumer banking systems on the cloud rather than on the bank’s own servers.

In the end, Solomon’s top-down style and penchant for reorganizations proved the death knell. In January 2020 he remapped the company, combining consumer banking and wealth management in a new unit run by Goldman veterans lacking experience of retail financial services. That left Marcus without a representative on Goldman’s elite management committee. That year, nobody from the consumer bank was promoted to the firm’s prestigious partner level.

Eventually, Talwar and Ismail quit, followed by Scherr and a raft of other engineers and executives. Blankfein had retired. Chavez and former finance chief Harvey Schwarz were gone too. Solomon drafted in Peeyush Nahar, a former Uber executive, and Swati Bhatia, who recently retired after just two years at the firm. “We haven’t had all the talent that we’ve needed,” Solomon lamented in January.

Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics

With ambitious Wall Streeters in charge and a shortage of consumer expertise, it’s little wonder Marcus ended up, in Solomon’s words “doing too much.” Only last February, the Goldman boss upped the firm’s deposit and lending targets. The push for a checking account, which Solomon strongly backed, met with resistance from senior Marcus staff. When investment banking fees dried up last year, the bank lost its appetite for hefty investments with uncertain returns.

The irony is that while Marcus won’t become a digital superbank, its component parts are performing well. The consumer operations have generated around $5 billion of losses, but that comes in the context of Goldman’s nearly $60 billion of cumulative earnings over the last five years. The Apple card has brought the firm high costs, but Goldman topped JDPower’s consumer satisfaction rankings for midsize card issuers in 2022.

Moreover, it’s not obvious the rise and fall of Marcus has distracted Goldman from its traditional profit engines. Despite a slump in dealmaking activity, the firm reported higher investment banking fees than any of its rivals in 2022. Its equity traders generated more revenue than Morgan Stanley’s in 2022, and the company’s book value per share has increased 40% since the end of 2019.

Even if Goldman can return Marcus to profitability, it can’t win back lost time. As the firm tried vainly to be the “leading consumer banking platform,” rival Morgan Stanley was successfully pushing into wealth management, which now brings in half its revenue. Solomon’s new idea of targeting individuals through their employers is one Morgan Stanley hit on three years ago. A plan to pitch alternative investments to wealthy clients is more Goldman-like, but involves taking on established giants like Blackstone (BX.N).

The stakes are also higher now. One reason for launching Marcus was to provide Goldman with more stable revenue to offset swings in its trading and dealmaking arms. That volatility is why investors pay one-fifth less per dollar of Goldman’s earnings than Morgan Stanley’s. It’s a discount senior employees, who are often paid in stock, are quick to lament. And even if it’s not all Solomon’s fault, it’s definitely his problem.

764,688,APPLE,2023-02-02,"Nasdaq, S&P 500 post strong gains on Fed relief, Meta surge","Summary

Summary Companies Meta soars on cost controls, $40 bln share buyback

Merck slides on disappointing forecast, UnitedHealth drops

S&P 500, Nasdaq hit roughly 5-month highs

Indexes: Dow down 0.11%, S&P up 1.47%, Nasdaq up 3.25%















Feb 2 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq and S&P 500 ended higher on Thursday and touched roughly five-month highs as a more dovish-than-expected message from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell boosted equities and Meta Platforms shares soared on rigorous cost controls.

The Dow slipped, dragged down by declines in some big healthcare stocks.

Investors were still digesting the Fed's policy decision on Wednesday and comments from Powell, who acknowledged progress in the fight against inflation and appeared reluctant to push back against the rally in stocks and bonds.

“I think the reaction to yesterday’s Fed comments really encouraged investors to go risk on,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. ""The bottom line for investors I think is that the Fed’s comments were unexpected.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 39.02 points, or 0.11%, to 34,053.94, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 60.55 points, or 1.47%, to 4,179.76 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 384.50 points, or 3.25%, to 12,200.82.

Shares of megacap stocks Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) also gained strongly ahead of results due after market close on Thursday, with Apple rising 3.7%, and Amazon and Alphabet both up over 7%.

In initial after-hours trading, however, shares of all three companies fell after their respective results.

After a bruising 2022, U.S. stock markets have made a strong start to the year, with tech and other stocks that lagged last year leading the rebound amid hopes that the Fed will temper its aggressive rate hikes, which in turn could alleviate some pressure on equity valuations.

Those trends continued on Thursday. The communications services sector (.SPLRCL) jumped 6.7%, its biggest daily gain in almost three years, led by a 23.3% surge for Facebook parent Meta (META.O). The company revealed stricter cost controls this year and a $40 billion share buyback, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg called 2023 the ""year of efficiency.""

The S&P 500's 50-day moving average moved above the 200-day moving average, a pattern known as a ""golden cross"" that is perceived by many as a bullish technical signal for near-term momentum.

The energy sector (.SPNY), one of last year's standout performers, fell 2.5%, while healthcare (.SPXHC) dropped 0.7%.

UnitedHealth Group (UNH.N) shares fell 5.3% after the U.S. government proposed Medicare Advantage reimbursement rates below analyst estimates, and the stock weighed down the Dow. A 3.3% decline in Merck (MRK.N) shares, after the drugmaker forecast 2023 earnings below Wall Street estimates, also dragged on the blue chip index.

Shares of drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY.N) dropped 3.5% after sales of its closely watched diabetes drug missed estimates.

Data showed jobless claims fell last week to a nine-month low, highlighting the labor market's resilience, ahead of monthly U.S. employment numbers on Friday.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.55-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 36 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 162 new highs and 16 new lows.

About 15 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 11.7 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

765,272,APPLE,2023-02-02,"Democratic senator urges Apple, Google to kick TikTok out of app stores","













WASHINGTON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, should be removed from app stores run by Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google because the short video social media app poses a risk to national security, Senator Michael Bennet, a Democrat on the intelligence committee, said in a letter dated Thursday.

The app, which Congress has already banned from federal government devices, has come under increasing criticism because of concern that China's government could use it to harvest data on Americans or advance Chinese interests.

""No company subject to CCP (Chinese Communist Party) dictates should have the power to accumulate such extensive data on the American people or curate content to nearly a third of our population,"" Bennet wrote in the letter to Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai and Apple CEO Tim Cook.

""Given these risks, I urge you to remove TikTok from your respective app stores immediately,"" he wrote.

Prior to Bennet's letter, Republicans have largely led the charge on TikTok and national security concerns, although Democratic Senator Dick Durbin previously urged Americans to stop using the app.

In the House, which is now in Republican hands, the Foreign Affairs Committee plans to hold a vote this month on a bill aimed at blocking TikTok's use in the United States, the committee confirmed. read more

In 2020, then-President Donald Trump attempted to block new users from downloading TikTok and ban other transactions that would have effectively prevented TikTok's use in the United States, but the move was rebuffed by the courts.

For its part, the company says China's government cannot access the personal data of U.S. citizens or manipulate the app's content.

TikTok Chief Executive Shou Zi Chew is due to appear before the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee in March. read more

A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Ankur Banerjee

After the central bank triple-header (that's the Fed, ECB and BoE) buoyed risk appetite and emboldened investor hopes of the end of the massive global tightening cycle came the Big Tech triple-header to revive worries over global economic conditions.

Dour fourth-quarter results from Apple (AAPL.O), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) are likely to cast a shadow on the markets on Friday before the crucial non-farms payroll data is released later in the day.

Analysts expect 185,000 jobs were added last month and the report will likely paint a clearer picture of the labour market in the United States.

With the market facing up to the reality of the economic downturn, Asian stocks eased with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) 0.7% lower and set to end the week in the red after five consecutive weekly gains. The dollar firmed, while gold steadied.

Meanwhile, Adani Group shares continue to bleed with market losses now over $115 billion (for the seven listed Adani firms)in the wake of a scathing report from U.S short-seller Hindenburg that came out on Jan. 24. The meltdown in share prices have stoked fears of wider impact on the Indian equities.

A bright spot for the market was a private sector survey that showed China's services activity in January expanded for the first time in five months, sending business confidence to near 12-year highs.

Even amidst the dire earnings reports from U.S. bellwethers there was a hint of hope that consumer spending was beginning to rebound in China.

Feb 3 (Reuters) - Big Tech companies have a new obsession: artificial intelligence.

This week, chief executives across the sector packed earnings calls with mentions of the heavily hyped technology, which until recently existed more in the background than as a solid contributor to the bottom line.

In conference calls after financial results, tech execs uttered the phrases ""AI,"" ""generative AI,"" or ""machine learning"" from two to six times as often as they did in the previous quarter, according to a review of conference transcripts by Reuters.

Executives from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), behind the latest big rivalry in tech, took their battle to the conference-call front lines. On Thursday, Alphabet appeared to edge out the competition. The Google-owner's call referred to AI 45 times, up from 13 times at the end of the third quarter, outpacing Microsoft, whose call was peppered with 39 references, up from 15 in the previous quarter.

The release of software that can generate virtually text and images, exemplified by ChatGPT, a chatbot from the startup OpenAI, has set off a race to integrate AI into more products and for investors to bet on which company will emerge on top.

Microsoft's investment in OpenAI and aggressive efforts to make ChatGPT widely available to its cloud customers, among other plans, represent a new challenge to Alphabet. Industry observers have said embedding human-like, ChatGPT-style responses in Microsoft's Bing search engine could give it a leg up on Alphabet's Google, long the information search leader.

In a potential nod to the public's ChatGPT fixation, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said Google remained in the game.

""We'll pursue this work boldly, but with a deep sense of responsibility,"" he said.

AI software will be an important focus for Alphabet, which is planning to make its own LaMDA chatbot software publicly available in the coming weeks, he added.

David Heger, an analyst with Edward Jones, said Google was opening up more about its large AI investments after staying quiet.

""They were much more vocal about how that benefits pretty much all parts of their business and how they expect that to be further integrated into their business going forward,"" he said.

SHAPING SOCIAL MEDIA

Snap Inc (SNAP.N) CEO Evan Spiegel said on the social media company's fourth-quarter call that generative AI would be critical over the next five years to growing augmented reality (AR), which is important to its business.

That technology, which overlays computerized images onto the real world, is currently limited because artists must build 3D models, but generative AI can speed up the process, Spiegel said.

""Imagine playing around with your kids wearing AR glasses and saying, 'oh my gosh, there's a pirate ship and a big monster.' We can bring those to life using generative (AI) art, which I think is really exciting,"" he said.

Mark Zuckerberg likewise called generative AI ""an extremely exciting new area"" on Wednesday during a conference call that referenced the phrase 30 times, up from 22 times in the previous quarter. The Facebook founder and CEO of Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), whose shares rocketed 20% after reporting financial results, said users could expect the company to ""launch a number of different things this year"" in generative AI.

Meta plans to incorporate the new technology across almost all its products, such as generating images, videos, avatars and 3D assets, Zuckerberg said. The software will help content creators produce more across Meta's apps, he added. And marketers could use generative AI to help with written copy for their paid posts or create imagery and video, Nicola Mendelsohn, vice president of the global business group for Meta, said in an interview.

""One of my goals for Meta is to build on our research to become a leader in generative AI,"" said Zuckerberg.

Even at Apple Inc (AAPL.O), where hardware such as the iPhone has reigned supreme, AI is a big part of the future.

Asked by an analyst about Apple's AI strategy, Chief Executive Tim Cook said Thursday the company is using such tech to power features like car crash detection in its iPhone and Apple Watch, and that it will be applied throughout Apple's products and services.

""We see an enormous potential in this space to affect virtually everything we do,"" Cook said. ""It's obviously a horizontal technology, not a vertical. And so it will affect every product and every service that we have.""

A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.

The coast may be clearing on interest rates but a spluttering economy still has the power to check runaway stock markets.

What investors have to work out is how much the economic drag is simply the condition for relief on rates. Friday's release of January's U.S. employment report will provide some clues - but Big Tech gave its own readout on Thursday.

Underwhelming quarterly results from mega cap technology giants Apple (AAPL.O), Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) provided the reality check after the bell late on Thursday - enough to send their share prices down 3%-5% in out-of-hours trading and knock futures on this week's soaring Nasdaq (.IXIC) and S&P500 (.SPX) indices back about 1% too.

The updates have been enough to curb what had been the best three days for Wall St indices in about four months - after the best January for the Nasdaq in 22 years - as investors bet the U.S. Federal Reserve's credit squeeze is near done.

Apple earnings fell short of expectations and it forecast revenue would fall for a second quarter in a row. But even though iPhone sales fell for the first time since 2020, it said sales were likely to improve as production had returned to normal in China after COVID-related shutdowns.

Data on Friday backed that assertion as China's services sector activity in January expanded for the first time in five months. Spending and travel got a boost from the lifting of stringent COVID-19 curbs and business confidence hit near 12-year highs.

But Alphabet also posted fourth-quarter profit and sales short of expectations as Google's advertising clients pulled back spending from a period of pandemic-led excess.

And Amazon said operating profit could fall to zero in the current quarter as savings from layoffs do not make up for the financial impact of consumers and cloud customers clamping down on spending.

To what extent layoffs in the tech sector are fanning out across the economy will be monitored in the payrolls report later and the Fed will be watching wage growth like a hawk.

Payrolls are expected to have risen by another brisk 185,000 last month, although the unemployment rate likely ticked up to 3.6% from a more than 50-year low of 3.5% in December.

Annual wage growth is expected to have slowed to 4.3% from 4.6% in December.

The extent to which the market thinks the Fed has nearly finished its rate rise campaign - and seeding some of the FOMO, or fear of missing out, behaviour on Wall St - can be seen in the drop in two- and 10-year Treasury yields to their lowest since September.

Ten-year yields have fallen a full percentage point since the peaks of October.

Elsewhere, shares of India's Adani Group companies fell sharply again on Friday as ripples from a market rout disrupted parliament for a second day, driving fears of investment contagion across the country following last week's critical research report by a U.S. short-seller.

Seven listed Adani enterprises lost more than half their market capitalisation, which shrivelled to less than $100 billion, after the Hindenburg Research report raised questions about the conglomerate's debt levels and use of tax havens. The group shelved its $2.5-billion share sale on Wednesday,

S&P Dow Jones Indices said it would drop the Adani Enterprises flagship from widely-used sustainability indices on Feb. 7, blunting their appeal for environment-conscious investors.

Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Friday:

* U.S. Jan employment report, Jan ISM service sector survey

* U.S. corp earnings: Cigna, Aon, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Zimmer Biomet, LyondellBasell, Cboe Global Markets, Church & Dwight.

Feb 3 (Reuters) - Disappointing earnings from Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) on Thursday renewed concerns of a slowdown in demand as consumers and businesses remain cautious about spending amid rising economic uncertainty.

The tech industry has already laid off thousands of employees in an effort to cut costs as it braces for an impending slowdown.

The following graphics highlight the companies' shaky performance in key areas:

WEAK IPHONE SALES

The world's largest publicly traded company's quarterly profit missed Wall Street expectations for the first time since 2016 as it struggled with disruptions to iPhone production in China.

""Apple's results are consistent with the broader technology-sector challenges, with a difficult macroeconomic environment slowing sales for digital advertising, e-commerce, and (as reflected by Apple's performance) consumer electronics,"" said D.A Davidson analyst Thomas Forte.

Reuters Graphics

DIGITAL ADVERTISING SLUMP

The parent company of digital advertising giant Google also missed earnings expectations as businesses dialed back spending on fears of a possible recession.

""If a dominant ad player like Google can get hit like this, it is now officially a tough ad market,"" said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Barton Crockett.

Reuters Graphics

SLOW CLOUD GROWTH

Amazon's revenue beat for the holiday quarter was largely overshadowed by a warning from the e-commerce giant that its lucrative cloud business was set for slower growth in the next few quarters.

""This year is likely to be a difficult year for AWS growth. One of the key advantages of AWS – that it is easy to flex spending upwards – is also one of its key disadvantages when the economy slows down,"" said Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell.

POST-EARNINGS STOCK REACTION

Shares of the three companies - all of which have market valuations of more than a trillion dollars - were trading between -4.9% and 1.5%. The stock slump also dragged the wider market lower.

Indian mobile phone exports nearly doubled year-on-year to $5 billion between April-October in 2022, primarily supported by the government's key scheme to offer incentives to local manufacturers.

At the annual budget for 2023/24 on Wednesday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharamam eliminated the 2.5% customs duty on select parts of mobile camera phones.

""The duty structure now encourages them (phone manufacturers) to import parts and assemble here,"" V. Rama Mathew, member of India's Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, said in an interview.

""The duty changes will benefit all phone sectors. But it will also benefit the premium phone sector because if you see the cost of components, camera assembly contributes substantially,"" Mathew said.

The move comes as Apple aims to boost its share of India-produced phones to 25%. Apple exports from India hit $1 billion in December.

The Cupertino, California-based company has bet big on India since it began assembling iPhones in the country in 2017 via Wistron (3231.TW), and later with Foxconn (2317.TW), in line with the Indian government's push for local manufacturing.

Foxconn plans to quadruple the workforce at its iPhone factory in India over two years, sources told Reuters late last year.

J.P. Morgan analysts have estimated that a quarter of all Apple products would be made outside China by 2025, up from 5% currently.

771,417,APPLE,2023-02-03,Tech earnings hit pause button on market rally,"













Feb 3 (Reuters) - Big Tech led U.S. markets on a sharp rebound to kick off 2023. The message from their earnings on Thursday: not so fast.

Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) all posted results for the end-of-year quarter that left a sour taste in investors' mouths. The reports renewed questions about global economic demand, the effect of higher interest rates and whether the market's January rally got ahead of itself.

Nascent signs that consumer spending was beginning to rebound in China were not enough to change that.

Apple, the world's largest publicly traded company, fell short of expectations, hurt by lower iPhone sales and production disruptions in China. Amazon said operating profits could fall this quarter due to lower demand, and Alphabet's online advertisers cut back their spend as well.

Shares of Amazon dropped about 5%, while Alphabet retreated nearly 2%, on course to collectively shed nearly $93 billion from their respectively market valuations. Apple reversed early losses to trade 3.5% higher.

""Maybe the tech stocks rallied a little bit too much into these numbers, so the market will be taking a deep breath and saying, 'OK, well these companies aren't bulletproof,'"" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta, Georgia.

These three firms and Microsoft (MSFT.O), the four U.S. companies with trillion-dollar market values, have led the broad-market S&P 500 in 2023. The index is up nearly 9% year-to-date, with Amazon gaining 34%. Big Tech surged Thursday following a strong quarterly report from Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O).

That's after the group was battered throughout 2022, trailing the S&P, which dropped nearly 20%.

David Trainer, chief executive of New Constructs in Nashville, Tennessee, said not enough people in the market are paying attention to company fundamentals.

""We're in a speculator's market, not an investor's,"" he said, noting recent trading in retailer Bed Bath & Beyond, which is expected to file for bankruptcy soon. ""What we've seen in January and late December was a huge increase in liquidity and a return to the meme stock way.""

Some investors saw silver linings from Apple and other bellwethers, including Starbucks, that reported results on Thursday. They noted that lockdowns in China strangled sales for many companies in the world's second-biggest economy, expecting a rebound in the coming year.

""When things started to reopen in December (in China), we did see an increase in traffic to our stores as compared to November and an increase in demand as December rolled around,"" Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters.

Cook said lockdowns in China hurt both production and demand, and the company faced headwinds from the strong U.S. dollar that pushed revenues lower.

""Currency was a headwind but will be a tailwind in Q1,” said Nancy Tengler, chief executive of Laffer Tengler Investments in Scottsdale, Arizona, referring to the dollar's weakening trajectory.

""The supply chain was a problem more so than demand, and that seems to have been right-sized.""

Similarly, Starbucks said comparable sales fell 29% from the previous year in China, the company's fastest-growing market, but that beginning in January, it saw ""very encouraging"" recovery momentum there.

Other U.S. consumer bellwethers painted a mixed picture. Consumer staples giant Clorox said product volumes fell in three of the company's four business segments in the fourth quarter, while automaker Ford said the year ahead was going to be a difficult one.

They, and other companies, are still grappling with higher interest rates that are slowing demand. This year's surge in stocks has been built on a rally in bonds, as lower yields make high-valuation shares more attractive. Cost-cutting by Alphabet and Meta led some investors to think that interest rates are affecting demand.

""In many respects we're waiting for that other shoe to drop – the impact of higher rates on the economy, inflation, earnings and jobs,"" said Jack Ablin, co-founder and chief investment officer at Cresset Capital, which manages $30 billion. ""Profits tend to trough nine months after overnight rates peak and we haven't even seen the peak in overnight rates yet.""

772,817,APPLE,2023-02-06,EU's Breton urges rethink on cross-border telecoms mergers,"













BRUSSELS, Feb 6 (Reuters) - EU industry chief Thierry Breton urged antitrust regulators on Monday to consider allowing more cross-border mergers in the European telecoms industry, backing calls by Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), Orange (ORAN.PA), Telefonica (TEF.MC) and Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI).

EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager has been reluctant to allow telecoms providers acquire EU peers without hefty remedies, especially when deals reduce the number of players from four to three, underlining concerns about the market power of fewer but larger telecoms operators.

The telecoms industry however said consolidation is required to pool resources to roll out costly fast-speed broadband and 5G.

""I believe that creating a true single market for telecommunications services also requires a reflection on encouraging cross-border consolidation, all while preserving fair and necessary competition for the benefit of our consumers,"" Breton said in a speech to be delivered at an event in Helsinki.

On the issue of whether Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O), Meta (META.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) should bear some network costs, Breton said the European Commission will launch a consultation this month on the topic.

""The investments which will be required to achieve our ambitions will be enormous and we need to ensure that they are matched by the availability of sufficient funding. The burden of this financing should not be only on the shoulders of the member states or the EU budget,"" he said.

""At a time when technology companies are using most bandwidth and telco operators are seeing their return on investment drop, this also raises the question of who pays for the next generation of connectivity infrastructure,"" Breton said.

773,316,APPLE,2023-02-06,Retailers offering discounts on high-end iPhones in China,"













SHANGHAI, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Third party retailers in China are offering discounts of as much as 10% on Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhone 14 Pro amid sluggish demand for smartphones.

Electronics vendors JD.Com Inc (9618.HK) and Suning (002024.SZ) are currently selling the iPhone 14 Pro basic model for 7,199 yuan ($1,062), checks of JD.com's app and Suning's website showed. That is 800 yuan cheaper than the standard price on Apple's official China website.

A number of other authorised Apple third party sellers are offering similar discounts on the iPhone 14 pro and Pro Max, Reuters checks of promotions on social media showed.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Apple will occasionally allow partner vendors in China to offer discounts on its phones to spur demand.

""The return of price cut even for the best-selling iPhone 14 models is not a good sign for demand,"" Jeffries analyst Edison Lee wrote in a note to clients, adding that several Android brands have also cut prices.

China's smartphone sales in 2022 clocked in at 286 million, the lowest level in a decade, with sales in the fourth-quarter sliding 14% due to poor demand, according to research firm Canalys. read more

Apple sales tumbled 24% in the quarter, Canalys said, in part due to an early release of the iPhone 14 series and in part due to supply chain issues caused by worker unrest at contract manufacturer Foxconn.

The China Securities Journal first reported the price cuts on Sunday.

Exports median forecast -20% y/y (prior month -12.1%)

Imports median forecast -18.2% y/y (prior month -11.4%)

Balance median forecast $3.945 bln (prior month $4.79 bln)

CPI median forecast +2.69% y/y (prior month +2.71%)















TAIPEI, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Taiwan's exports in January likely fell for the fifth month in a row amid fears of a global recession, uncertainties due to the war in Ukraine, and the COVID situation in China impacting tech demand, according to a Reuters poll.

Taiwan, a global hub for chip production and a key supplier to Apple Inc (AAPL.O), is one of Asia's leading exporters of technology goods. The trade data is seen as an important gauge of world demand for tech gadgets.

Exports were estimated to have dropped 20% in January from a year earlier, a Reuters poll of 18 analysts showed on Monday, a faster rate than the 12.1% annual contraction seen in December.

The export forecasts varied widely, projecting a contraction of between 12.2% and 30%. The variation reflected uncertainties over the global economy, supply chain disruptions due to COVID cases in China, and the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine war.

Taiwan's finance ministry said last month that January exports could be down by 20%-24% from a year earlier.

Separately, the consumer price index was expected to have been 2.69% higher in January than a year earlier, rising slower than the 2.71% annual rate seen in December, according to the poll.

The trade data will be released on Tuesday followed by the inflation data on Thursday.

775,503,APPLE,2023-02-07,Arm CEO says firm fully committed to a market listing this year,"













SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 7 (Reuters) - The chief executive of Softbank-owned British chip technology firm Arm told Reuters on Tuesday that the company is committed to a stock market float this year.

""The plans are actually fairly well developed and underway now,"" Rene Haas said in an interview after Arm's corporate parent reported its fourth straight quarter of losses. ""We're doing everything we can and are committed to have it happen this year.""

Arm's fiscal third quarter sales were up 28% to $746 million, one of the few growth areas for Softbank (9984.T) as its vast portfolio of early stage technology startup investments weighed on its results.

Arm is the world's biggest supplier of chip design elements used in smartphones, selling intellectual property to companies like Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O). Arm makes money off upfront licensing deals with such companies and then a royalty on each chip sold using its technology.

Part of Haas' strategy has been to speed up Arm's push into other markets such as data center servers, where companies like Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) cloud unit are using Arm-based chips.

Those efforts helped boost upfront license revenue 65% to $300 million as Arm signed new deals in cloud computing and other segments, though company executives conceded that some of the growth was driven by multiple deals landing at once.

Arm said per-chip royalties, which are steadier than its deal-making business, were up 12% to $446 million in the quarter. That growth came amid a slowdown in the smartphone business that dragged down results at Apple and Qualcomm.

Haas said Arm is ""not immune"" to the softening smartphone market but that the company has licensed more intellectual property into each chip than in the past. With the most advanced phone chips now using 10 to 12 computing cores along with the newest version of Arm's computing architecture, he said that translates into higher royalties for each chip sold.

""The diversification that we've done and, in core markets, just having more technology in the chips means that we've been able to withstand the downturn better than most,"" Haas said.

(Reuters) - Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith said Tuesday that it has hired six attorneys to its cybersecurity practice from rival law firm Wilson Elser Moskowitz Edelman & Dicker.

The move comes after 32 Lewis Brisbois attorneys and 12 business professionals left in January to form a cybersecurity group at Atlanta-founded, midsize labor and employment law firm Constangy, Brooks, Smith & Prophete.

The new hires joining Los Angeles-founded Lewis Brisbois will be spread across four offices. Partner Robert Walker joins the firm in Jackson, Mississippi, along with two associates, and will chair the firms data privacy and cybersecurity practice. Ross Molina joins as a partner in New Orleans; partner Tawana Johnson joins in Atlanta; and another associate will be based in Houston.

The attorneys handle data privacy compliance, pre- and post-incident cybersecurity, and national and international breach response, the firm said.

Walker spent almost four years at Wilson Elser, where he served as co-chair of the cybersecurity and data practice.

Lewis Brisbois co-chairman Bob Smith said in a statement that the new team will expand the firm's ""breach response and counseling"" offerings for insurance and corporate-based clients.

A representative from Wilson Elser did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the departures.

LOS ANGELES, Feb 7 (Reuters) - After a life-threatening bout of COVID-19, five-time Grammy winner Shania Twain hopes to bring joy to the world with her new album ""Queen of Me"".

Like everyone else, the Canadian singer and songwriter was cooped up during the pandemic. But instead of navel gazing, Twain, 57, said she put herself in a playful frame of mind.

Now, she wants everyone to rejoice with her as the pandemic subsides.

""There's so many things to celebrate right now and we are still in celebration mode. That's the mode I'm in and I sense it with the fans as well,"" she said.

As an asthmatic, Twain's battle with COVID was bad and developed into pneumonia, she said in an interview with Apple Music 1. ""Every day my lungs were filling up with inflammation. Within 12 days, I was pretty much dying.""

After recovering, she drew inspiration by recording her new album. Released on Feb. 3, it already has two singles - the line-dancing upbeat country number ""Giddy Up!"" and the aspirational and catchy ""Waking Up Dreaming.""

""When I'm getting into the songwriting mode, I'm just dreaming. I'm playing with my imagination, I'm letting it go, I'm in dream mode,"" she said. ""It's my dreams that set my goals.""

Twain, who has sold more than 85 million albums, began singing when she was 3 years old, and by 8 played at bars to help her family pay the bills.

The country music phenomenon is ready to tour the world with her new album, starting out in Spokane, Washington, in April and finishing in Vancouver, British Columbia, in mid-November.

Companies settled case during second day of West Texas trial















(Reuters) - Chipmaking giant Intel Corp (INTC.O) on Tuesday settled a patent lawsuit brought by wireless technology developer ParkerVision Inc (PRKR.PK) on the second day of a West Texas jury trial in the case, court records showed.

A ParkerVision filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday said it would receive $25 million in a settlement that also includes a patent licensing agreement.

An Intel spokesperson confirmed that the companies settled but declined to provide further details. A ParkerVision spokesperson declined to comment. ParkerVision stock was down 48% Tuesday afternoon.

Jacksonville, Florida-based ParkerVision sued Intel in Waco, Texas in 2020 for infringing several patents related to improved radio-frequency receivers. ParkerVision had said it pioneered the communications technology used in Intel's wireless chips in the mid-1990s.

ParkerVision said Intel chips used in smartphones, including Apple's iPhone, infringe the patents. Intel denied the allegations, arguing the patents are invalid and its technology works in different ways.

A ParkerVision expert told the court that Intel should pay more than $294 million in royalties for the alleged infringement, according to a court filing.

ParkerVision has also sued companies including Apple, Qualcomm and TCL for patent infringement over wireless chips and devices that use them.

A Florida federal judge overturned a $173 million jury verdict for ParkerVision against Qualcomm in 2014. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the decision in 2015.

Santa Clara, California-based Intel has been hit with two verdicts in Waco for damages totaling over $3 billion in a separate, ongoing patent fight with VLSI Technology LLC over Intel computer chips.

The ParkerVision case is ParkerVision Inc v. Intel Corp, U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, No. 6:20-cv-00108.

LUXEMBOURG, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Belgium and EU competition regulators on Wednesday faced off again in Europe's second-highest court on whether Belgium's 700-million euro ($750 million) tax scheme for Magnetrol, BP (BP.L) and 33 other multinationals was illegal state aid.

The European Commission in 2016 ordered Belgium to recover the money from the companies that benefited from the scheme, one of several high-profile cases in a crackdown on sweetheart tax deals between EU countries and multinationals.

Belgium won the first round of its fight in a lower tribunal, which annulled the Commission's ruling in 2019. But Europe's top court backed the EU regulator and referred the case back to the General Court.

Ireland had also won the first stage of its court fight against an order to recover some 13 billion euros from Apple (AAPL.O) in 2016.

EU nations caught in the tax crackdown received a boost last year when the top EU court backed Fiat Chrysler in its fight against the regulator's order to pay 30 million euros in back taxes to Luxembourg.

Belgium on Wednesday brandished the Fiat ruling in its arguments to the General Court.

""The Commission wrongly identified the reference framework in breach of the method clearly set out in the Fiat judgment, namely the determination of the reference framework must follow from the examination of the content and specific effects of rules under the national laws of that state,"" Belgium's lawyer Marianne Clayton said.

She said the Commission also erred as it did not examine separately the issues of advantage and selectivity, and if this was granted to the companies.

Ireland's lawyer Paul Gallagher said the Commission's approach was technically flawed and breached the EU treaty and national sovereignty.

Commission lawyer Paul John Loewenthal said it was clear that the scheme offered tax breaks to multinationals, with Belgium widely advertising the measure.

""Multinationals are given tax breaks if they bring jobs and investment,"" he told the court, citing the Belgian finance ministry's advertisement.

The court will hear arguments from some of the companies on Thursday and next week. The case is T-131/16 RENV.

781,255,APPLE,2023-02-08,"Schibsted, publishers look to EU tech rules to resolve Apple antitrust concerns","













BRUSSELS, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Norwegian media group Schibsted (SCHA.OL) and the European Publishers Council have urged EU antitrust regulators to ensure that tech rules coming into play this year will rein in Apple's (AAPL.O) powers, especially over its App Store.

The comments from Schibsted, the largest media group in the Scandinavia region, and the publishers' lobbying group come as the European Commission's Digital Markets Act (DMA) takes effect in May, targeting Big Tech.

Apple is already in the EU antitrust crosshairs related to its App Store practices in music streaming, in e-books and competing apps as well as its mobile payment system Apple Pay.

Apple's App Store practices affect Schibsted because of its market power in Scandinavia where up to 60% of consumers have an iPhone in Norway and Sweden, said Petra Wikstrom, director of Public Policy at Schibsted.

""Apple's App Store policies, such as imposing high fees, taking control of the entire customer relationship, and withholding important user information under the guise of privacy and security, hamper our transition to a subscription-based business model,"" she told Reuters in an interview.

""Therefore, to put an end to such abusive practices in the digital space and induce positive behavioural change, it is crucial that the DMA is effectively implemented and enforced,"" Wikstrom said.

The EPC, whose members include chairmen and chief executives of Axel Springer, News UK, Conde Nast, the New York Times and The Guardian, echoed similar concerns.

""Yes, the EPC has the same position and concerns which we have raised directly with the commission too. The DMA is very clear in its obligations and we expect them to be enforced,"" EPC Executive Director Angela Mills Wade told Reuters.

The commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple, which would be forced to loosen its App Store rules under the DMA, could not be reached for comment.

The company has previously said that 85% of developers on the App Store do not pay any commission and only apps with more than $1 million in annual revenue pay 30%.

In 2021, to allay Japanese antitrust concerns, it scraped the ban on providing separate links on App Store apps for reader apps which provide content such as e-books, video and music.

782,502,APPLE,2023-02-09,"AMD wins nearly a third of processor market, Arm's climb slows: analyst report","













Feb 9 (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) has captured nearly a third of the market for central processor units while British chip technology firm Arm Ltd's rise in the PC market slowed in the fourth quarter of 2022, according to an analyst report.

AMD has grabbed share away from Intel Corp (INTC.O), which still remains the largest player in the market for what are known as x86 processors, which work with popular operating systems like Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Windows. In the fourth quarter, Intel had 68.7% market share for x86 processors versus AMD's 31.3%, which was up from 28.5% a year earlier, according to Mercury Research.

The results came amid what Mercury Research President Dean McCarron said in the report was the worst downturn in the PC chip market since the 1980s and possibly the worst in the industry's history. After snapping up PCs and laptops for working from home during the pandemic, consumers and businesses have slowed their purchases amid rising inflation and economic uncertainty.

But the slowdown has played out differently for AMD and Intel. AMD last month beat Wall Street sales expectations while Intel conceded that it has ""stumbled"" in competing with its longtime rival, with Intel's expected losses forcing broad employee pay cuts.

AMD declined to comment on the analyst report. Arm was not immediately available for comment.

But the PC sales slump has also affected Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) Mac computer lineup, which is the leading source of sales for Arm-based PC chips.

Mercury said Arm PC chips, led by Apple's in-house chips but also joined by Qualcomm Inc's (QCOM.O) recent PC chips for Windows machines, now have 13.3% share of the market PC chips, down from 14.6% a quarter earlier but still up from 10.3% share a year ago.

Arm, which is owned by Japan's Softbank Group Corp (9984.T), licenses its technology to companies like Apple and Qualcomm to make into PC chips and has made expansion into new markets like PCs a major part of is sales growth strategy ahead of an expected initial public offering later this year.

BRUSSELS, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) will seek to convince EU antitrust regulators that it does not block rivals' access to its technology used for mobile wallets at a closed hearing on Tuesday, people familiar with the matter said, the last chance for it to do so before possible hefty fines.

The hearing, which senior European Commission and national competition officials, Apple executives and complainants will attend, comes nine months after the EU competition watchdog accused the company of abusing its market power.

The EU antitrust watchdog has said Apple's anti-competitive practices dated back to 2015 when Apple Pay was launched.

The Commission declined to comment. Apple referred to its statement last year which said that Apple Pay is only one of many options available to European consumers and which has ensured equal access to its tap and go technology Near-Field Communication (NFC).

The company could face fines of up to 10% of its global turnover if found guilty of antitrust violations. It is also the target of EU charges of abusing its dominance in the music streaming market in a case triggered by a complaint by Spotify (SPOT.N). There is no EU decision yet on that case.

VIENNA, Feb 10 (Reuters) - The family of a Jewish woman who was forced to sell a Gustav Klimt painting in 1938 to survive have agreed to pay Austria $11.3 million after a mix-up over the painting concerned meant the wrong one was returned to them, Austria said on Friday.

Nora Stiasny, Viennese niece of art collector Victor Zuckerkandl, was deported by the Nazis with her mother Amalie Zuckerkandl to the Izbica ghetto in Poland for being Jewish. She is believed to have been killed there or in the nearby Belzec extermination camp.

Austria returned Klimt's ""Apfelbaum II"" (""Apple Tree II"") to Stiasny's descendants from Vienna's Belvedere museum in 2001, believing it to be the painting she was forced to sell in 1938, the year Nazi Germany annexed Austria.

Experts later determined, however, that the painting she sold was in fact most likely Klimt's ""Rosen unter Baeumen"" (""Roses Under Trees""), and in 2021 France agreed to return that work to Stiasny's heirs from the Musee d'Orsay.

By then, however, the family had sold ""Apple Tree II"", and the current owners were not interested in selling it, Austria's culture ministry said in a statement announcing the settlement with Stiasny's family.

""Even though it hurts that it is not possible to bring the painting 'Apple Tree II' back to Austria, it is still gratifying that the long and complicated issue of this painting's restitution is coming to an end with the settlement that has now been reached,"" the statement quoted the junior minister for art and culture, Andrea Mayer, as saying.

786,557,APPLE,2023-02-13,Indian electronics maker Dixon expects 12% sales growth this financial year -executive,"













CHENNAI, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Indian electronics manufacturer Dixon Technologies (DIXO.NS), supplier to brands like Samsung and Xiaomi, expects revenue to rise 12% in the current financial year and is considering setting up a plant in Tamil Nadu state, a top executive told Reuters on Monday.

Dixon's Managing Director Atul Lall said the company is ""seriously considering"" investing in Tamil Nadu in the next 12-18 months. It currently has factories in three Indian states but not in Tamil Nadu, a hub for electronics and automotive manufacturing and home to major production facilities of Apple suppliers like Foxconn and Pegatron.

Lall was speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of an electronics event in the southern Indian state.

His forecast for sales growth of 12% in the financial year ending in March 2023, to about $1.45 billion, would mark a sharp slowdown from 66% growth in the previous financial year.

Revenue from contract manufacturing of telecom devices, smart watches and wireless products like ear buds is likely to grow 15-20%, Lall added.

Dixon's share price has been under pressure in recent months due to slowing sales growth in previous quarters.

789,233,APPLE,2023-02-13,"Apple supplier Salcomp sees India revenue of $2-$3 bln, plans rapid hiring","













CHENNAI, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Finland's Salcomp, a supplier to Apple (AAPL.O), plans to double its workforce in India to 25,000 over the next three years, targeting annual revenue in the country of at least $2 billion to $3 billion by 2025, a top company executive said on Monday.

The plans come as Apple shifts production away from China after its strict COVID-related lockdowns and restrictions, and with rising trade and geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington.

""The whole supply chain is now kind of looking at an alternative. And India is poised to be one of the best alternatives,"" Sasikumar Gendham, managing director, Salcomp Manufacturing India, told reporters in Chennai city in southern India during an industry event.

""Everyone knows that the whole world has been depending on this one nation (China) over the last few decades and it's time to really diversify and decluster,"" he added.

Cupertino, California-based Apple has bet big on India since it began iPhone assembly in the country in 2017 via Wistron (3231.TW) and later Foxconn (2317.TW), in line with the Indian government's push for local manufacturing.

Gendham told Reuters that Salcomp will have a ""significant role"" in Apple's supply chain.

Salcomp currently employs about 12,000 at its Chennai plant, where it makes mostly chargers, but also other smartphone parts.

It started the Chennai operation in 2020 having reached an agreement a year earlier to take over the facility formerly owned by Finnish telecom equipment maker Nokia.

Gendham said he expects the India business to generate at least $2 billion-$3 billion in revenue by 2025, from less than 40 billion rupees ($484 million) now.

Foxconn (2317.TW) is also planning to quadruple the workforce at its iPhone factory in India over two years, Reuters reported last year.

J.P.Morgan analysts estimated last year that a quarter of all Apple products would be made outside China by 2025, from 5% currently. Apple wants India to account for up to 25% of its production from about 5%-7% now, the country's trade minister said in January.

Salcomp also said it is setting up a housing complex with entertainment and education facilities for about 15,000 people.

Feb 14 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is facing challenges as it tries to increase production in India, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the iPhone maker's operations.

The Cupertino, California-based company has been shifting production away from China after the country's strict COVID-related restrictions dented supply chains across industries and as trade and geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington escalated.

At a casings factory in southern India run by conglomerate Tata Group, only about half of the components from the production line are in good enough shape to be sent to Apple's supplier Foxconn (2317.TW), FT reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.

This 50% 'yield' does not meet Apple's goal for zero defects, FT reported, adding that the company's process of expanding in India has been slow in part due to challenges in logistics, tariffs and infrastructure.

Apple and Tata Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Apple has bet big on India since it began iPhone assembly in the country in 2017 through Wistron Corp (3231.TW) and later Foxconn, in line with the Indian government's push for local manufacturing.

Last month, India's trade minister said that Apple wants India to account for up to 25% of its production from about 5 - 7% currently.

793,60,APPLE,2023-02-14,"Berkshire dumps shares in TSMC, banks; increases Apple stake","













NEW YORK/BANGALORE, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) slashed its stake in Taiwanese contract chipmaker TSMC (2330.TW), as well as in some banks in the fourth quarter, while bolstering its holdings in Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

Berkshire cut its position in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) by 86.2% to 8.29 million sponsored American depositary shares, according to a regulatory filing.

This comes roughly three months after Berkshire unveiled it bought more than $4.1 billion worth of TSMC stock, which sent shares of the world's largest contract chipmaker soaring.

TSMC depository receipts fell 4% in U.S. after hours trade on Tuesday. In Taiwan, TSMC shares opened down 3.3% as Asian markets started Wednesday trading.

Depositary shares in TSMC, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, have surged almost 32% this year, closing at $97.96 on Tuesday.

""Berkshire made a small profit on TSMC. It was not a huge, huge win for Berkshire,"" said Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research analyst. According to her calculations, Berkshire bought it for roughly $68.5 and sold for $74.5.

It is rare but not unprecedented for Berkshire to quickly undo a multi-billion dollar investment in a company's stock. In the first quarter of 2022, Berkshire sold nearly all of what had been an $8.3 billion stake in Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) that it amassed in late 2020.

Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett, arrives to attend the annual Allen and Co. Sun Valley Media Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, U.S., July 5, 2022. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid

TSMC last month said revenue in the first quarter is likely to dip 5% as it weathers a global downturn in the chip industry because of softening consumer demand for electronics. TSMC executives have said they do not expect market conditions to improve until the second half of the year.

Besides TSMC, Buffett also divested 91.4% of its shares in US Bancorp (USB.N), to 6.7 million shares, and shrunk its stake in BNY Mellon by roughly 60%, to 25.1 million shares. Both cuts totaled nearly $5.5 billion at current prices.

Buffett's conglomerate also holds shares in Citigroup Inc (C.N), Bank of America (BAC.N) and Jefferies (JEF.N).

Berkshire trimmed some positions across its portfolio of U.S. listed companies, including Chevron (CVX.N), Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O), maker of the ""Call of Duty"" video game, and Kroger (KR.N).

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is making efforts to conclude the acquisition of Activision Blizzard. On Feb. 21, Microsoft will defend the deal in front of European Union and national antitrust officials at a closed hearing.

Among Berkshire's few additions are Apple, which Buffett views more as a consumer products company. Berkshire bought another 20.8 million Apple shares worth $3.2 billion, raising its stake to 5.8%, according to the filing.

Shares in Apple have surged nearly 18% this year.

Berkshire also disclosed a new stake of $84 million in building materials company Louisiana-Pacific Corp (LPX.N).

794,857,APPLE,2023-02-14,Exclusive: EU's Breton plans consultation on Big Tech and telecoms network costs,"













STRASBOURG, Feb 14 (Reuters) - EU industry chief Thierry Breton is poised to launch a consultation on whether Big Tech should bear some telecoms network costs, he said on Tuesday ahead of a telecoms conference taking place in Barcelona from Feb. 27 to March 2.

EU telecoms providers including Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), Orange (ORAN.PA), Telefonica (TEF.MC) and Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) have for years sought to have Big Tech foot some infrastructure cost for 5G and broadband.

The telecoms companies say the six largest content providers - Meta (META.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O) - account for more than half of data internet traffic.

The tech giants say the idea amounts to an internet traffic tax that could undermine Europe's net neutrality rules to ensure all users are treated equally.

Asked when the consultation would be launched, Breton told Reuters: ""Wait for my speech at Barcelona. Yes, I will announce it soon. At Barcelona.""

The consultation is likely to take about 12 weeks before the European Commission will propose legislation that will need to be thrashed out by EU countries and EU lawmakers before it can become law.

Breton said he was confident the process could be wrapped up by the end of the year. ""We will have time, yes,"" he said.

Announcing the start of the consultation at Barcelona is a strong signal to the telecoms sector of Breton's backing, a telecoms industry source said. It would be Breton's first appearance at an event traditionally attended by all major telecoms operators.

795,177,APPLE,2023-02-15,"Norwegian payment app Vipps takes on Apple, wants EU antitrust action","













BRUSSELS, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Norwegian mobile payment app Vipps wants European Union (EU) antitrust regulators to force Apple (AAPL.O) to allow access to its tap and go technology without any restrictions so that other companies can be more competitive, Vipps Chief Executive Rune Garborg said.

Garborg's comments came a day after Apple made a last ditch bid to convince EU antitrust regulators that it does not block rivals' access to its technology used for mobile wallets at a closed hearing. Vipps was a third party at the hearing.

Vipps, owned by a consortium of Norwegian banks and which merged with Danish peer MobilePay last year, said the issue is critical because of Apple's popularity in the Nordics and the increasing use of mobile payments, which is powered by near field communication (NFC) technology.

""This is really important for us. Seventy-eight percent of card transactions in Norway are done through terminals. It is why NFC is so important especially among young people,"" Garborg told Reuters.

""Apple is only sharing NFC with banks, which have to pay for installing their cards in Apple Pay. But for us as a wallet, we don't have open access to NFC,"" he said.

Vipps said NFC access would increase the geographical reach of its mobile wallet, make it easier to innovate products and better enable cross-border transactions.

Apple had no immediate comment. The company has previously said that Apple Pay is one of many options available to European consumers and which has ensured equal access to its technology.

Vipps said it tried several alternatives to NFC but found them cumbersome and not competitive.

WASHINGTON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has in recent months escalated its long-running antitrust probe on Apple Inc (AAPL.O), the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday citing people familiar with the matter.

Reuters previously reported the Justice Department opened an antitrust probe into Apple in 2019 to review whether technology giants were using their size to act in an anti-competitive manner.

The Wall Street Journal report said the department has now assigned more litigators, while new requests for documents and consultations have been made with all the companies involved.

The probe will also look at whether Apple's mobile operating system, iOS, is anti-competitive, favoring its own products over those of outside developers, the report added.

The Justice Department declined to comment, while Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Last month, the Justice Department sued Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, accusing it of abusing its dominance in digital advertising, threatening to dismantle a key business at the heart of one of Silicon Valley's most successful internet companies.

In 2020, the Justice Department sued Google alleging violations of antitrust law in how the company acquires or maintains its dominant position in online search and is scheduled to go to trial in September.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is investigating Amazon.com for possible antitrust violations. The commission began probing Amazon during the Trump administration.

The retail giant has been criticized for allegedly favoring its own products and disfavoring outside sellers on its platform.

Jordan is a leading member of the House Freedom Caucus. February 8, 2023. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein/File Photo/File Photo















WASHINGTON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - U.S. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan on Wednesday subpoenaed the chief executives of Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms (META.O), and Microsoft (MSFT.O) for documents and communications relating to free-speech issues.

Jordan and other conservatives accused the companies of suppressing conservative speech during the Trump administration, and expanded that accusation to include colluding with the Biden administration once he won the White House. The White House and major tech companies have rejected the allegation.

""These subpoenas are the first step in holding Big Tech accountable,"" Jordan's office said in a statement.

Microsoft and Meta said that they had already begun producing documents. Microsoft said it was ""engaged with the Committee, and committed to working in good faith."" None of the other three companies responded to a request for comment.

The subpoenas, sent to Alphabet's Sundar Pichai, Andy Jassy of Amazon.com, Tim Cook of Apple, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, and Satya Nadella of Microsoft, demand documents and communications related to alleged collusion between the government and the companies to stifle free speech.

Jordan set a March 23 deadline to turn over documents.

Republicans who took control of the House of Representatives in January after narrowly winning control in the November elections have made questions about Big Tech a top focus and created a Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government.

Last week, the panel held its first hearing into Republican claims that the Justice Department and FBI show anti-conservative bias, a move made following the FBI's discovery of hundreds of classified documents at Republican former President Donald Trump's Florida resort.

Jordan wrote related letters to the companies in December, making similar demands to big tech but this was when the House was in Democratic hands and before he became chair. Jordan's office said that the companies did not adequately comply.

800,773,APPLE,2023-02-17,"India's Redington expects double-digit growth, to enter new markets","













CHENNAI, Feb 17 (Reuters) - India's Redington Ltd (REDI.NS) is targeting double-digit revenue growth for the next financial year and a foray into new markets, betting on a pandemic-led push for digitising corporate and government offices, its top boss told Reuters on Friday.

Redington, which distributes products for over 290 brands, including Apple (AAPL.O) and Samsung (005930.KS), is looking to enter about a dozen new countries like Indonesia, Myanmar and Azerbaijan in the next couple of quarters, Managing Director Rajiv Srivastava said.

Chennai-based Redington, which operates in 38 countries, is also increasing its 4,500-odd workforce by 5% globally in about a year.

The expansion comes at a time when global economies are contending with a slowdown, and the pandemic-led demand for consumer electronics is fading out as schools and offices reopened.

Still, the drive towards digitisation by governments and businesses is a ""one-way street"" as offices would have to continue to spend on servers, storage and software upgrades driving revenue growth for companies like Redington, Srivastava said in the interview.

Redington earlier this month recorded its highest-ever quarterly revenue for the three months ended Dec. 31 even as its profit slipped due to higher expenses.

Srivastava said Redington, which has reported a double-digit topline growth for the last three years, would continue to be on a similar trajectory for the year ending March 2024.

Analysts, on average, expect revenue for the period to climb nearly 11% to 862.74 billion rupees ($10.42 billion), according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The Redington MD further said that new gadget launches would now reach Indian consumers faster, given the recent electronics manufacturing boom coming on the back of global businesses looking to limit their reliance on China.

The company's shares, which climbed nearly 25% in 2022, closed marginally lower at 179.85 rupees on Friday.

802,823,APPLE,2023-02-17,Investors pull cash from classic risk plays as Fed rate picture shifts,"













LONDON, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Investors turned more cautious in the week to Wednesday, according to data from Bank of America, as a run of data prompted many to raise their forecasts for how high the U.S. Federal Reserve will take interest rates.

BofA Global Research's weekly ""Flow Show"", released on Friday, showed the largest outflows from technology funds since September, the largest outflows from emerging market debt funds in 14 weeks, and the largest outflows from junk debt funds in eight weeks.

Stronger-than-expected data on U.S. employment, retail sales and inflation this month have pushed up expectations for how much higher the Fed will need to raise rates, a development that is typically bad news for riskier stocks and emerging market assets.

BofA analysts said the data means it is ""mission very much unaccomplished for the Fed"" despite its 450 basis points of monetary tightening in this cycle so far.

""Fed tightening always 'breaks' something,"" they add.

Emerging market debt funds saw outflows of $700 million, the largest weekly outflow in 14 weeks, according to the report which attributed the decline to debt investors reducing risk.

High yield - or junk - debt saw outflows of $2.6 billion, the largest in eight weeks, and tech funds had $1.1 billion of outflows, the most since September.

Elsewhere, there were $5.5 billion inflows to bonds, $1 billion inflows to cash, $300 million to equities and $45 million to gold.

Equity markets have largely shrugged off fears of the impact of higher for longer rates, so far.

The tech heavy Nasdaq (.IXIC) is set for a weekly gain and is trading near the five-month high hit in early February, and France's benchmark CAC 40 index (.FCHI) hit a record high on Thursday boosted by solid results at some of the country's biggest companies, including luxury names and energy firms.

However, BofA analysts said: ""Remember 'buy humiliation, sell hubris' ... this time last year, likes of Moderna, Tesla, Apple widely viewed as ""must-own"" stocks; this year, it's likes of Exxon, Raytheon, Hermes ... always hedge hubris.""

803,391,APPLE,2023-02-17,Tech giants from Google to TikTok face tougher EU rules,"













BRUSSELS, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Tech giants including Facebook, Google, Twitter and TikTok face stricter online content rules in the European Union due to their huge number of users.

The new rules, known as the Digital Services Act (DSA), classify companies with more than 45 million users as very large online platforms (VLOPs) and require them to do risk management and external and independent auditing.

They will also have to share data with authorities and researchers and adopt a code of conduct.

The European Commission had given online platforms and search engines until Feb. 17 to publish their monthly active users. Those labelled as VLOPs have four months to comply with the rules or risk fines.

Twitter on Thursday said it had 100.9 million average monthly users in the EU, based on an estimation of the last 45 days.

Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) provided one set of numbers based on users' accounts and another set based on signed-out recipients, saying users can access its services whether they sign in to an account or are signed out.

It said the average monthly number of signed-in users totalled 278.6 million at Google Maps, 274.6 million at Google Play, 332 million at Google Search, 74.9 million at Shopping and 401.7 million at YouTube.

Apple (AAPL.O) said only its App Store built for its iPhones, with more than 45 million monthly users, qualified as a very large online platform. But it will also apply the same rules to the App Store for iPads, Mac computers, Apple Watch and TV, and to its Apple Books e-books and podcasts paid subscriptions.

""Apple intends, on an entirely voluntary basis, to align each of the existing versions of the App Store (including those that do not currently meet the VLOP designation threshold) with the existing DSA requirements for VLOPs,"" it said on its site.

Amazon (AMZN.O) said it had more than 45 million users in the EU, while Microsoft (MSFT.O) said its Bing search engine had 107 million average monthly users in the last six months of 2022.

Alibaba Group Holding's (9988.HK) e-commerce site AliExpress said its average monthly active users in the EU was above 45 million from Aug. 1 last year to Jan. 31 this year.

TikTok has 100.9 million average monthly users in the EU based on an estimation of the last 45 days.

Ebay (EBAY.O) said it was below the EU user threshold.

Meta Platforms (META.O) has said it had 255 million average monthly active users on Facebook in the EU and about 250 million average monthly active users on Instagram in the last six months of 2022. Companies will have to report user numbers every six months.

804,53,APPLE,2023-02-21,Biden admin won't veto ITC's Apple Watch import ban ruling,"













(Reuters) - The Biden Administration will not overrule a U.S. International Trade Commission decision that could block imports of Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) Apple Watches for infringing AliveCor Inc patents related to heart monitoring, the office of the U.S. Trade Representative said Tuesday.

An AliveCor spokesperson also said it had been informed there would be no veto of the ruling. Any ITC ban is still on hold while Apple and AliveCor continue to clash over the patents.

The ITC ruled in December that imports of Apple's smartwatches should be banned for infringing AliveCor's patents, but it placed the ban on pause while related proceedings over the patents run their course. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office found the patents invalid earlier that month, in a ruling that AliveCor has said it will appeal.

Apple said Tuesday it will appeal the ITC's import ban decision, which it said would have a negative effect on public health.

Representatives for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. The ITC had no comment.

The White House had 60 days to decide whether to veto the ITC's Dec. 22 ruling based on policy concerns.

Presidential vetoes of ITC import bans have historically been rare. However, the Obama administration reversed a ban on some iPhones and iPads in 2013 in a patent fight between Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, citing its effects on U.S. consumers and economic competition.

AliveCor accused Apple of infringing three patents related to its KardiaBand, an Apple Watch accessory that monitors a user's heart rate, detects irregularities and performs an electrocardiogram to identify heart problems like atrial fibrillation.

Mountain View, California-based AliveCor told the ITC that Apple copied its technology and drove it out of the market by making Apple's operating system incompatible with the KardiaBand.

Apple Watch Series 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 have ECG technology. Apple introduced its most recent Series 8 last year.

AliveCor has separately sued Apple in California federal court for allegedly monopolizing the U.S. market for Apple Watch heart-rate apps, and filed a related patent infringement lawsuit against Apple in Texas federal court.

Apple has countersued AliveCor in San Francisco federal court for allegedly infringing its patents.

The ITC case is Certain Wearable Electronic Devices With ECG Functionality and Components Thereof, U.S. International Trade Commission, No. 337-TA-1266.

805,567,APPLE,2023-02-21,Foxconn chairman to visit COVID-hit iPhone plant in China -source,"













TAIPEI, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way departed on Tuesday for a four-day inspection of the company's iPhone plant in Zhengzhou, China, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said.

This will be Liu's first visit to the world's largest Apple (AAPL.O) iPhone factory in his role as chairman, and his main goals are to review conditions after the resumption of production and to extensively exchange views, the source said.

Liu is scheduled to meet with senior government officials including Lou Yangsheng, the Communist Party chief of Henan province where Zhengzhou is located, the source said.

Foxconn (2317.TW), formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, declined to comment. The Henan government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The source briefed on the matter declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.

The Taiwanese company's iPhone plant was hit late last year by a COVID-19 outbreak that prompted thousands of worker departures and unrest, as well as production disruptions.

In January, Foxconn said output at its Zhengzhou plant had ""basically returned to normal.""

808,834,APPLE,2023-02-22,Anti-ESG crusader Ramaswamy launches U.S. presidential bid,"













NEW YORK, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Vivek Ramaswamy, the activist investor who launched a firm last year to pressure companies to abandon environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) initiatives, said on Tuesday he would run for President of the United States.

Ramaswamy, 37, will step down as executive chairman of Strive Asset Management, which raised more than $650 million from investors in less than six months, to pursue his bid for the presidency in 2024, according to the firm's website.

""We've celebrated our 'diversity' so much that we forgot all the ways we're really the same as Americans, bound by ideals that united a divided, headstrong group of people 250 years ago,"" Ramaswamy tweeted on Tuesday following his announcement.

A former biotechnology investor and executive, Ramaswamy will pursue the Republican nomination in what is shaping up to be a crowded field.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, former Vice President Mike Pence and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott are among those considering mounting a challenge to former President Donald Trump, who has already announced his candidacy and is, according to most opinion polls, the frontrunner for the Republican nomination. Former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley has also announced her candidacy.

A political outsider, Ramaswamy rose to prominence in 2021 as the author of ""Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam"". His new firm bought small stakes in some of the world's biggest companies, including Chevron Corp (CVX.N), BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O), and called on them to drop ESG policies such as advancing diversity or cutting carbon emissions in order to focus on their profits.

It is unclear how much impact Strive has had on the companies it pressured. But Ramaswamy's contrarian message made him popular in conservative political circles and a regular guest on cable TV shows.

Ramaswamy co-founded Strive with former Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA executive Anson Frericks, who will continue to run the firm.

Feb 23 (Reuters) - Apple's (AAPL.O) Chinese contract manufacturer Luxshare Precision Industry Co Ltd (002475.SZ) will help develop the iPhone maker's long-awaited augmented reality (AR) device, Nikkei Asia reported on Thursday.

Luxshare has taken over the AR development team in Shanghai, previously owned by Taiwan's Pegatron (4938.TW) that first helped Apple develop the device, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

Taiwan-based Foxconn (2317.TW) is also helping with the project, Nikkei said, and Apple has tapped two of its most important suppliers, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) and Sony (6758.T), to develop micro OLED displays for the device.

The iPhone maker, Luxshare Precision, Foxconn and Sony did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment, while TSMC declined to comment.

Apple's headset is set to cost around $3,000 and will be launched at this year's spring event, Bloomberg previously reported.

The company hopes to reduce the price for the second generation of the device, Nikkei said.

The device will compete with the likes of Meta Platforms' (META.O) Quest Pro virtual and mixed-reality headset launched late last year at $1,500.

812,625,APPLE,2023-02-24,EA founder Trip Hawkins dives into Web3 with Barcelona-based startup,"













Feb 24 (Reuters) - Former Apple executive Trip Hawkins, who founded the company behind the best-selling sports videogame franchise ""FIFA"", is joining a Web3 startup, looking to take on top blockchain games like Axie Infinity.

The founder of Electronic Arts (EA.O) will join as co-founder and strategy chief of Games for a Living (GFAL), Hawkins told Reuters in an interview.

GFAL publishes titles compatible with blockchain technology across consoles, personal computers and smartphones - commonly called Web3.

Interest for Web3 gaming has risen over the past year as it is touted to attract more cryptocurrency users. Players can own, sell, and trade in-game goods in such games.

Hong Kong-based blockchain gaming developer Animoca Brands, which backs popular NFT game Axie Infinity, raised more than $500 million in 2022.

""Web3 is the bridge to the metaverse,"" Hawkins said on Thursday. ""And if we're going to make a metaverse, the economy of the metaverse has to be more like the real world.""

Although there are concerns around security as ""cyberwallets"" are more prone to hacking, developers are also looking to diversify their platforms amid stunted growth and high app-store fees.

Founded in 2021 by former King executive Manel Sort, Barcelona-based GFAL had a post-money valuation of 13.2 million euros ($13.96 million) after its latest funding round last year.

LOS ANGELES, Feb 24 (Reuters) - LAFC will look to get their bid for back-to-back MLS championships off to a winning start when they battle crosstown rivals LA Galaxy in front of an anticipated record crowd at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena on Saturday night.

LAFC prevailed in the most thrilling final in league history against Philadelphia last season when Gareth Bale's stunning extra time goal tied the rollercoaster affair 3-3.

The home side then broke the hearts of the Union in a one-sided penalty shootout to claim their first MLS Cup and cap a season where they also won the Supporters' Shield for having the best regular-season record.

With the win, LAFC delivered on the high expectations that came when the team launched in 2018 with a celebrity ownership group and a glamorous new stadium.

That investment has more than paid off. Earlier this month Forbes announced that LAFC was the first MLS club to reach $1 billion in value.

Despite Bale's retirement, oddsmakers like LAFC and veteran captain Carlos Vela to hoist the Cup again with the Union, NYCFC and Austin FC also in the mix.

APPLE TV ERA BEGINS

Saturday's supersized edition of the ""El Trafico"" derby is expected to draw more than 75,000 to the historic Rose Bowl and help launch a new era for MLS, which entered into a blockbuster 10-year partnership with Apple TV during the offseason.

The deal, which is reportedly worth $2.5 billion, is a bet by the tech giant that the league and its youthful, diverse and tech-savvy fanbase will contend with the NFL, NBA and MLB in the years to come.

""We talk about how we want the league to continue to grow and bridge the gap in comparison with other leagues, and I think having this Apple partnership is a step in the right direction,"" LAFC midfielder Kellyn Acosta told reporters last month.

""Leading into the World Cup in 2026, you want to build momentum and gain more exposure, and I think this partnership is going to truly be beautiful.""

While Fox and FS1 will still carry some games on traditional cable, the bulk of the matches will be streamed on Apple TV through its MLS Season Pass at a price of $79 a year for Apple TV+ subscribers and $99 for those without.

Season Pass subscribers can watch matches on Apple and non-Apple devices. Broadcasts will be available in English and Spanish, with all matches involving Canadian teams also available in French.

LEAGUE EXPANSION

The season could also be pivotal for the continued growth of the league, which began in 1996 with just 10 teams but will boast 29 this season with the addition of St. Louis City SC.

MLS commissioner Don Garber is widely expected to announce yet another expansion franchise before the year's end, with the goal of fielding 30 teams when the United States co-hosts the 2026 World Cup.

""Those people who don't even know that they love the game will love the game when they experience the World Cup, because that's the nature of the pageantry and the passion and the uniqueness of so many countries coming together and playing this almost life-or-death tournament,"" Garber told Reuters.

He said while San Diego and Las Vegas were the well-publicized frontrunners to get the nod to host a team, it was still very much up for grabs. He also pointed to Sacramento as a potential candidate.

""We've said that in the past ... a city was a front runner. Then somebody swooped in and it ended up going someplace else,"" he said.

Summary Companies This content was produced in Russia, where the law restricts coverage of Russian military operations in Ukraine.















MOSCOW, Feb 27 (Reuters) - U.S. tech giant Apple has paid a 906 million rouble ($12.12 million) fine in a Russian antitrust case alleging abuse of its dominance in the mobile apps market, Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) said on Monday.

Apple, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, has previously ""respectfully disagreed"" with a FAS ruling that Apple's distribution of apps through its iOS operating system gave its own products a competitive advantage.

The FAS determined in August 2020 that Apple had abused its dominant position, then issued a directive requiring Apple to remove provisions giving it the right to reject third-party apps from its App Store.

That move followed a complaint from cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab, which had said a new version of its Safe Kids application had been declined by Apple's operating system.

""Apple has paid a 906 million rouble antitrust fine,"" the FAS said in a statement on its Telegram channel.

Apple had appealed the decision at various stages, but had been unsuccessful and ultimately complied with the order, the FAS said.

In a separate case, the FAS in January said it had fined Apple around $17.4 million for allegedly forcing Russian developers to use Apple's payment services with the iOS App Store.

Apple paused all product sales in Russia a year ago, after Moscow despatched its armed forces to Ukraine, and limited its Apple Pay service in Russia.

815,378,APPLE,2023-02-27,"Qualcomm, Android phone makers developing satellite messaging feature","













Feb 27 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) on Monday said it was working with a group of Android smartphone companies to add satellite-based messaging capabilities to their devices.

The San Diego, California-based company, which is the world's biggest supplier of chips that connect mobile phones to wireless data networks, said it is working with Honor, Lenovo-owned (0992.HK) Motorola, Nothing, OPPO, Vivo and Xiaomi Corp (1810.HK) to develop the devices.

Satellite-based communications can send and receive data in remote or rural regions where other telecommunications networks are not available. Qualcomm announced that it was adding the capabilities to its chips earlier this year.

Qualcomm's work with Android device makers is likely to intensify competition between those brands and Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which last year unveiled the ability to send emergency satellite messages as one of the flagship features of its newest iPhone lineup. Those new iPhones contain a chip from Qualcomm, though Apple told Reuters that they also contain custom hardware and software that are proprietary to Apple.

Qualcomm did not say when the new satellite messaging features from the Android smartphone brands named on Monday would become available. Earlier this year, Qualcomm said that some Android phones would have the features by the second half of this year.

NEW DELHI, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) supplier Foxlink has halted production at its assembly facility in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh after a massive fire led part of the building to collapse on Monday, two local government officials told Reuters.

Foxlink, a unit of Taiwan's Cheng Uei Precision Industry Co Ltd (2392.TW), makes cables for iPhone chargers. It set up a factory in Andhra in 2020.

The fire broke out in the afternoon and damaged roughly 50% of the machinery at the factory, said J Ramanaiah, who leads the Fire Services Department for Tirupati district in the state.

The business impact on Apple was not immediately clear and the root cause of the incident was unknown. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An official for Foxlink did not respond to calls seeking comment.

The fire is now under control and there were no casualties, said Ramanaiah. He showed Reuters photos and videos of the factory blaze with charred machinery inside the plant and groups of fire fighters trying to douse the fire. The videos and photos showed huge plumes of smoke rising from the plant.

""Management has conveyed to us that they estimate a loss of roughly 1 billion rupees ($12 million) from the incident,"" Ramanaiah said.

Cupertino, California-based Apple has bet big on India since it began assembling iPhones in the country in 2017 via Wistron (3231.TW) and later with Foxconn (2317.TW), in line with the Indian government's push for local manufacturing.

It has several other supplier partners in India, with Foxlink being one of them.

818,16,APPLE,2023-02-28,EU antitrust regulators narrow charges against Apple,"













BRUSSELS, Feb 28 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators on Tuesday narrowed their case against Apple (AAPL.O), focusing on its App Store rules that prevent developers from informing users of other purchasing options, while dropping another charge related to in-app payments.

The European Commission, which acts as the executive for the 27-country European Union, did not say why it had dropped its case against the iPhone maker for requiring developers to use its own in-app payment system.

However, the victory for the U.S. tech giant will be short-lived as a new EU tech law known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which will apply from May, bans both of the Apple practices investigated by the Commission, with fines of up to 10% of a company's global turnover for infringements.

The Commission said Apple's so-called anti-steering obligations, which prevent developers from informing users about other purchasing options, violate EU rules against unfair trading conditions.

These obligations are ""neither necessary nor proportionate for the provision of the App Store on iPhones and iPads"" and ""are detrimental to users of music streaming services on Apple's mobile devices who may end up paying more"", the EU competition enforcer said in a statement.

Apple said it was pleased the Commission, which can fine it up to 10% of its global turnover for antitrust violations, had narrowed the case and it would respond to the regulator's concerns.

Spotify (SPOT.N) triggered the case against Apple by complaining about both its anti-steering mechanism and in-app payment system, leading the Commission to issue a charge sheet against Apple in April 2021.

The streaming giant urged the Commission on Tuesday to issue a swift decision.

The Commission said Tuesday's charge sheet, known as a statement of objections, would replace the 2021 document.

Summary

Summary Companies Foxlink factory makes iPhone charging cables

Four Foxlink assembly lines completely damaged in fire -source

Apple supply chain could be potentially hit -source















CHITTOOR, India, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Much of the fire safety equipment at Apple supplier Foxlink's (2392.TW) facility in southern India was not functional, a government official told Reuters on Tuesday, a day after a blaze halted production at the maker of iPhone charging cables.

The factory is located in the Chittoor district of India's Andhra Pradesh state and is unlikely to resume full operations for two months, raising supply chain concerns for the U.S. tech giant, Reuters reported earlier in the day.

Foxlink was engulfed in a massive fire on Monday that led part of the building to collapse, but there were no casualties.

Except for fire extinguishers, safety systems such as smoke detectors, sprinklers and fire hydrants were faulty, leading to a slower response in containing the fire, said J Ramanaiah, who leads the Fire Services Department in the region.

""The smoke detector was not activated and fire alarms didn't go off,"" Ramanaiah added.

Apple and Foxlink did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The cause of the fire is still being investigated.

The regional fire department will submit a report on the incident to state authorities, which will decide whether to investigate the matter further, said Shuvana Sony, zone manager of the industrial park where the plant is located.

Sony added her previous visits to the plant had shown no safety lapses at the facility.

Some Apple representatives visited the facility for meetings on Tuesday, according to three people familiar with the matter, although what was discussed was not clear.

Foxlink operates a total of 10 assembly lines in two separate facilities at the plant in Andhra, of which four were completely destroyed, one source with knowledge of the situation said. Production at the remaining six assembly lines is expected to resume later this week.

A second source said that Foxlink was a key supplier for Apple in India, and ""there could be potential supply chain disruptions for iPhones made in India, or shipped from India"".

Cupertino, California-based Apple has bet big on India since it began assembling iPhones in the country in 2017, in line with the Indian government's push for local manufacturing.

The incident is the latest problem to hit one of Apple's 11 suppliers in India.

Production was hit at a facility of Apple contract manufacturer Foxconn (2317.TW) in 2021 due to food poisoning among workers, and a Wistron (3231.TW) India plant was affected by worker unrest in 2020 over non-payment of wages.

IMPACT ON BUSINESS

Foxlink exports charging cables and some other equipment to countries such as China and Hong Kong, with total exports worth $32.2 million since 2022, according to figures from a private customs data provider.

Last year, the data indicates Foxlink exported around 7 million USB-C to lightning cables from India, and in January shipped 1.6 million units. Around 98% of exports were cables.

Foxlink's Indian sales numbers were not immediately clear.

Reuters visited the Foxlink site on Tuesday where part of the building was completely charred and residual smoke was still seen rising in the morning. The factory is surrounded by other industrial units, including one for Indian phone maker Karbonn.

Many workers gathered outside the facility, with some anxious about the status of their contract jobs. They told Reuters the fire broke out during lunch break on Monday.

""The fire became uncontrollable,"" one worker said, declining to be named.

Other Foxlink workers said they had been asked to not come to work on Wednesday.

A police official said on Monday there was an estimated loss of $12 million at the factory.

CHITTOOR, India, March 1 (Reuters) - India's Andhra Pradesh state has launched an investigation into what caused a fire at the factory of Apple (AAPL.O) supplier Foxlink that led to the collapse of part of the building and disrupted production, a government official said on Wednesday.

Foxlink's (2392.TW) plant, which makes charging cables for iPhones in the southern state, was engulfed in a massive fire on Monday, but there were no casualties. The fire department has said much of the fire safety equipment at the factory was not functional.

The factories department, which is responsible for ensuring the safety and welfare of workers in the state, has launched an investigation.

The department is ""investigating the fire accident at Foxlink factory and, over the next couple of days, is looking to probe how the fire happened,"" Ramakrishna Reddy, deputy chief inspector of factories, told Reuters.

Reddy added that his initial assessment was there were no immediate worker safety concerns as only a few employees had to be taken to hospital for first-aid after they reported dizziness following the incident.

Foxlink on Wednesday said it is investigating the cause of the fire and ""working hard to resume production"".

The incident has raised supply chain concerns for the U.S. tech giant Apple, given Foxlink was a ""key supplier"" in India, Reuters has reported.

823,270,APPLE,2023-03-01,Apple supplier Foxlink says working to resume production after India fire,"













TAIPEI, March 1 (Reuters) - Taiwanese Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier Foxlink (2392.TW) said on Wednesday it is working hard to resume production following a fire at a plant in southern India that halted operations at the maker of iPhone charging cables, sending its stock price down.

The factory is located in the Chittoor district of India's Andhra Pradesh state and is unlikely to resume full operations for two months, raising supply chain concerns for the U.S. tech giant, Reuters reported this week.

Foxlink was engulfed in a massive fire on Monday that led part of the building to collapse, but there were no casualties.

Foxlink, in a statement to the Taiwan stock exchange, said it is investigating the cause of the fire and ""working hard to resume production"".

In an earlier statement late on Tuesday, the company said that the site had been blocked off by the fire department and that four production lines were known to be damaged.

As the plant, equipment and inventory are covered by insurance, the fire has not yet had a significant impact on the company's finances and business, it added.

The company will coordinate with customers and suppliers to ""discuss solutions for the production capacity affected before resuming work"".

It did not elaborate.

A government official told Reuters that much of the fire safety equipment at the facility was not functional.

The company's stock closed down 2.3% on Wednesday, compared to a 0.6% rise for the broader market (.TWII).

The stock did not trade on Monday and Tuesday due to a holiday in Taiwan.

825,462,APPLE,2023-03-01,"Washington lawyer Tom Goldstein leaves Supreme Court practice, law firm","













(Reuters) - Longtime Supreme Court advocate Tom Goldstein, who has argued more than 40 cases before the high court, said Wednesday that he is ending his practice and retiring from the Washington, D.C., law firm he co-founded in 2011.

His firm, Goldstein & Russell, has relaunched without him as Goldstein, Russell & Woofter, led by partners Kevin Russell and Daniel Woofter.

Goldstein said in an email that his retirement is partly a response to the Supreme Court's evolving character.

""I have lots of business clients with cases that aren’t ideological. But in the important civil rights and social cases, the court’s conservative super-majority makes it very difficult for the little guy to win,"" he said.

Among his business cases before the Supreme Court, Goldstein was actively representing investors who sued software company Slack Technologies LLC over alleged misrepresentations in 2019. He said Goldstein, Russell & Woofter will now handle the case.

Russell described the firm as a new, distinct enterprise that still recognizes Goldstein's legacy.

Although he has left the firm that bears his name, Goldstein said he is not giving up his law practice entirely. He is still representing ""Fortnite"" video game maker Epic Games Inc in antitrust litigation against Alphabet Inc's Google and Apple Inc, challenging the rules of their respective app stores. He argued on Epic's behalf before the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in November.

""But I’m not joining another law firm. Instead, I’m interested in pursuing business opportunities; I’m an entrepreneur at heart,"" he said.

Goldstein, who was part of the team that represented Al Gore in Supreme Court litigation with George W. Bush over the 2000 presidential election, said he will continue on as publisher of SCOTUSblog, a website that tracks and analyzes cases before the high court, with his wife, Amy Howe.

826,671,APPLE,2023-03-02,Russia's Tinkoff banking app removed from App Store,"













MOSCOW, March 2 (Reuters) - Sanctioned Russian digital lender Tinkoff Bank said on Thursday its mobile applications had been deleted from Apple's App Store, following the imposition of European Union sanctions last week.

Tinkoff, owned by TCS Group Holding (TCSq.L), was included in the EU's tenth package of sanctions against Russia outlined last week as the latest punishment for Moscow's military campaign in Russia.

Tinkoff was forced to suspend trading in euros following the sanctions on Monday, and has now had its app removed from the App Store, it said.

In a statement, Tinkoff told its customers to ""keep calm"" and that those who had already installed the app would continue to have full functionality.

""Already installed apps will work as usual, you can still transfer money, top up your account and perform other operations,"" it said.

Tinkoff's brokerage app, used by millions of Russian retail investors, had also been deleted from the App store.

Other major Russian lenders who were previously sanctioned by the EU or United States also saw their apps deleted from the Apple and Google platforms shortly after sanctions were introduced.

As a branch-less digital-only bank, Tinkoff has millions of clients rely on its online services for their daily banking needs.

Founded as a specialist credit card provider by entrepreneur Oleg Tinkov, now an outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin, Tinkoff has grown rapidly over the last decade and is listed as one of the central bank's 13 systemically important financial institutions in Russia.

Russian state media also reported on Thursday that a number of smaller lenders who were sanctioned by the EU had their apps deleted from online stores on Thursday.

Tinkoff said it was working on a solution to allow users to download their app again in the future.

March 2 (Reuters) - American saxophonist Wayne Shorter, who wrote some of jazz's most acclaimed compositions and whose often plaintive playing changed the sound of jazz in the 1960s before he explored rock-fusion, died on Thursday aged 89.

His publicist, Alisse Kingsley, said he died in Los Angeles, without citing a cause.

Shorter made his name playing the tenor sax with drummer Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers in the late 1950s and joined trumpeter Miles Davis' influential 1960s quintet alongside pianist Herbie Hancock, bass player Ron Carter and drummer Tony Williams.

Shorter wrote some of the group's most famous songs including ""E.S.P."" and ""Nefertiti."" Davis hailed him as his band's ""idea person, the conceptualizer of a whole lot of the musical ideas we did"" who also ""understood that freedom in music was the ability to know the rules in order to bend them.""

Hancock also hailed Shorter's songwriting. ""The master writer to me, in that group, was Wayne Shorter,"" the keyboardist said. ""Wayne was one of the few people who brought music to Miles that didn't get changed.""

Shorter led his own band to produce a string of albums in the 1960s including ""Juju"", ""Speak No Evil"" and ""Adam's Apple"" which featured one of jazz's greatest standards ""Footprints.""

He co-founded jazz fusion band Weather Report in 1969 around the time he began to focus his playing on the soprano sax, and the band recorded one of the best-selling jazz records of all time, ""Heavy Weather,"" in 1977.

Other hit records included ""Native Dancer"" featuring Brazilian singer Milton Nascimento which mixed jazz, rock and funk with Brazilian rhythms.

In 2000, Shorter formed his first permanent acoustic group with pianist Danilo Perez, bassist John Patitucci, and drummer Brian Blade, which led to four albums of live recordings.

Shorter co-wrote an opera ""Iphigenia"" with singer and bass player Esperanza Spalding that premiered in 2021.

He won 12 Grammy awards including one as recently as last month.

Shorter suffered tragedy in his life with the death in 1985 of a daughter he had with his second wife, Ana Maria Patricio, who herself died when a TWA jetliner exploded shortly after taking off from New York in 1996.

NEW DELHI, March 2 (Reuters) - Apple supplier Foxconn (2317.TW) will invest an undisclosed sum in India's southern state of Telangana towards an electronics manufacturing facility in the south Indian state, the state's chief minister said on Thursday.

The investment will create 100,000 jobs in the state, Telangana's IT minister KT Rama Rao said. The announcement followed a meeting between Telangana's chief minister and the chairman of Foxconn earlier in the day.

Taiwan-based Foxconn already has operations in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, where it manufactures products for companies such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).

830,68,APPLE,2023-03-02,Apple blocks update to email app with ChatGPT tech,"













March 2 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has blocked an update to email app BlueMail, which uses a customized version of OpenAI's GPT-3 language model, the co-founder of the app developer told Reuters on Thursday.

""Apple has blocked the BlueMail update and continues to treat BlueMail unfairly and to discriminate against us,"" Blix's Ben Volach said.

""Other GPT-powered apps seem not to be restricted,"" he added.

Apple, which rejected the app update last week, asked the company to revise the app's age rating for those over 17 or implement content filtering, as BlueMail may produce content not appropriate for all audiences, according to a document viewed by Reuters.

""We want fair­ness. If we're re­quired to be 17-plus, then oth­ers should also have to,"" Volach tweeted, adding that many other apps that advertise ChatGPT-like features listed on Apple's app store do not have age restrictions.

Apple, which was looking into the complaint, said developers have the option to challenge a rejection through the App Review Board process.

""It suggests to us that the company may scrutinize apps with ChatGPT functionality in the same way it does others where there are concerns about the quality of the user experience and appropriate nature of the content or service provided by the app,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Thomas Forte said.

OpenAI's ChatGPT, which can generate content in response to user prompts, has captivated the tech industry.

Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google both announced their own AI chatbots earlier in February.

While AI-powered chatbots are a nascent field, early search results and conversations have made headlines with their unpredictability.

March 3 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) top executive Michael Abbott, who is in charge of cloud services, is leaving the company in April, Bloomberg News reported on Friday citing people familiar with the matter.

The iPhone maker did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Abbott, who joined Apple in 2018, heads the iCloud service and is in charge of the platform that powers features such as Emergency SOS and Find My on iPhones as well as new features including iCloud data encryption.

He previously held top roles at Twitter and Palm, and was a partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins.

Jeff Robbin, long-time Apple engineer, will take on Abbott's responsibilities, Bloomberg News reported.

Earlier this year, Insider reported that vice president of services Peter Stern, who oversaw an expansion of Apple's paid subscription businesses, particularly its television offering Apple TV+, would be leaving the company.

Shares in Apple were up about 3.4% in afternoon trading.

BENGALURU, March 3 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhones will soon be assembled at another site in the southern Indian state of Karnataka and 300 acres have been aside to set up a factory, the state government said on Friday.

Bloomberg News had earlier reported that Apple partner Foxconn Technology Group planned to invest about $700 million in the Karnataka site to ramp up local production.

The state's investment promotion division said in a tweet that the move would generate 100,000 employment in the next 10 years.

Apple and Foxconn did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment on the Bloomberg report.

Currently, iPhones are assembled in India by at least three of Apple's global suppliers - Foxconn and Pegatron (4938.TW) in Tamil Nadu, and Wistron (3231.TW) in Karnataka.

Apple has been shifting production away from China after the country's strict COVID-related restrictions disrupted the manufacturing of new iPhones and other devices in the country and also to avoid a big hit to its business from tensions between Beijing and Washington. read more

In January, India's trade minister said that Apple, which began iPhone assembly in the country in 2017 through Wistron Corp and later Foxconn, wants India to account for up to 25% of its production from about 5-7% currently. read more

835,659,APPLE,2023-03-06,Napoli owner says Serie A should keep hold of media business,"













ROME, March 6 (Reuters) - The owner of Italian league leaders Napoli has become the latest senior figure in Serie A to speak out against plans to allow external investors to invest in its media business.

""I have always been against selling,"" Aurelio de Laurentiis told Reuters on Monday.

""We should produce the content and then place it with the various platforms - Amazon, Netflix, Apple, DAZN and Sky,"" the film producer said.

Gerry Cardinale, whose RedBird Capital company owns AC Milan, made similar remarks last week when asked about reports that banks and investment funds were keen to acquire a share of Serie A's media rights operation.

Germany's Bundesliga is looking at outside investment in its media business as continental clubs seek to close the revenue gap on the English Premier League.

De Laurentiis has revived the fortunes of Napoli in almost two decades in charge and the team appears on course to win the Italian league for only the third time in its history.

They are also well placed to progress in the Champions League after a 2-0 away win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the first leg of their Round of 16 tie.

However, De Laurentiis took aim at European soccer's governing body UEFA which he said had a dominant position and did not understand business properly.

He again floated the idea of a European league but based on performance rather than a self-selecting group of big clubs and suggested national leagues such as Serie A should be slimmed down from their current 20 teams to accommodate this.

""Clearly there is a problem of merit, if you reach a certain position in national league you can participate,"" he said, speaking on the sidelines of an awards ceremony in Rome.

March 8 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is backing a music startup launched by one of its former executives.

The company, called Gamma, is the brainchild of former Apple Music Global Creative Director Larry Jackson and veteran music executive Ike Youssef. It positions itself as an alternative to traditional record labels.

""The artists shaping today's culture not only create music, but also video, film, podcasts, fashion, and more,"" Jackson said in a statement Wednesday. ""They shouldn't have to jump through multiple hoops to express themselves.

Gamma says it will support content creation -- whether that is music, video or podcasts, and provide audio and video distribution through Vydia, a company it acquired in December 2022.

Early projects will include work with Snoop Dogg and his Death Row catalog, Rick Ross, and Naomi Campbell, Gamma said. It also plans to collaborate with Todd Boehly's Eldridge, whose investments include the Los Angeles Dodgers, which is a major backer.

The independent studio A24 is among the start-up's investors. Gamma declined to comment on a published report that it has access to about $1 billion in capital.

837,886,APPLE,2023-03-08,"Berkshire Hathaway resumes Occidental purchases, stake reaches 22.2%","













March 7 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) has resumed its purchases of Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) shares after a five-month hiatus, increasing its stake in the oil company to about 22.2%, a regulatory filing showed on Tuesday.

Berkshire paid about $355 million for 5.8 million Occidental shares between March 3 and March 7, according to the filing.

The purchases were the first Berkshire has disclosed since late September. It ended last year with a 21.4% stake.

In August, Berkshire won U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission permission to buy up to 50% of Occidental's common stock.

Buffett's company now owns about 200.2 million Occidental shares worth $12.2 billion, based on Tuesday's closing price of $60.85.

Those shares would generate about $144 million of annual dividends, following a 38% increase that Occidental announced last month.

Berkshire also owns $10 billion of Occidental preferred stock that throws off $800 million of annual dividends, plus warrants to buy another $5 billion of common stock.

Occidental ended January with about 900 million shares outstanding.

Berkshire began buying large quantities of the Houston-based company's stock about one year ago.

After its stake surpassed 20%, Berkshire adopted the equity method of accounting for its holdings, and now reports its share of Occidental's results with its own.

Accounting rules normally require the equity method above the 20% threshold, reflecting an assumption that the holder might exert significant influence.

Berkshire ended 2022 with $128.6 billion of cash and equivalents. It plans to keep a $30 billion cushion.

Occidental's share price more than doubled in 2022, benefiting from higher oil prices after Russia invaded Ukraine.

Though fourth-quarter profit was lower than analysts expected, Occidental said it planned to raise capital spending this year and could repurchase up to $3 billion of stock.

Berkshire also owns dozens of companies including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, consumer brands such as Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom, and other stocks including Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

838,725,APPLE,2023-03-08,Australian regulator to monitor rapid growth in digital platforms sector,"













March 8 (Reuters) - The Australian competition regulator said on Wednesday it would probe the country's fast-evolving ecosystem of digital platform service providers as part of a five-year inquiry into the sector.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said consumers and businesses are becoming increasingly dependent on products and services offered by digital platforms such as Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Meta (META.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), and it's crucial to examine how these giants are expanding their reach in the country.

The regulator said it will look into procedures adopted by the sector such as creating confusing interfaces known as ""dark patterns"", which can ""manipulate users into taking certain actions"", as well as conditional service offerings, also known as ""tying"", that restrict access to particular services.

""Interconnected products ... can provide consumers with a seamless experience that simplifies everyday tasks, but it's important that competition and consumers are not harmed as digital platforms invest across different sectors and technologies and expand their reach,"" ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said.

ACCC also published an issues paper, seeking feedback from consumers, businesses and relevant stakeholders concerning the investment choices made by digital platforms and the potential effect on competition and consumers.

This follows the ACCC announcing in January that it had conducted a sweep to identify misleading testimonials and endorsements by social media influencers across a range of digital platforms.

The company, founded in 2018 by Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, has now raised $241 million but has yet to disclose what it is building, saying only that it is a ""software platform and consumer device built from the ground up for artificial intelligence.""

A video posted by the company and patent filings suggest that a wearable device will project information onto the real world and allow users to manipulate that information with their hands.

Humane also said that it is collaborating with OpenAI, the creator of AI products such as ChatGPT that can generate human-like conversational text and Dall-E that can generate images, to integrate OpenAI's technology into Humane's device.

Sam Altman, OpenAI's founder and a previous Humane investor, participated in funding round on Wednesday, the company said.

Humane also said that Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), which has built a massive cloud computing infrastructure specifically for AI, took part in the funding round.

Humane said it will partner with Microsoft's cloud to bring Humane's software services platform to market.

""Our products are built on an integrated device and cloud platform that will allow us, and others, to create AI-driven experiences that feel natural, fun and needed,"" Patrick Gates, another Apple veteran who is Humane's chief technology officer, said in a statement.

Humane also said that it is working with Korean electronics giant LG Electronics Inc (066570.KS) ""on potential (research and development) projects for the next phase of Humane products"" and with Volvo Car's (VOLCARb.ST) Tech Fund on ""a potential future collaboration which would be the first example of Humane’s offering being applied to the automotive industry.""

March 9 (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) and its supplier Foxconn (2317.TW) were among the companies that lobbied for a landmark liberalisation of labour laws in the southern Indian state of Karnataka earlier this month, the Financial Times reported, citing three people familiar with the matter.

The legislation led to introduction of laws that now allows 12-hour shifts, as well as night-time work for women, similar to company practices in China, the report said.

Apple has been shifting production away from China after the country's strict COVID-related restrictions disrupted the manufacturing of new iPhones and other devices in the country and also to avoid a big hit to its business from tensions between Beijing and Washington.

The report comes a week after the Karnataka government said that Apple Inc's iPhones would soon be assembled in the state and that a total of 300 acres have been set aside for a factory.

Apple, Foxconn and the Karnataka government did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

846,13,APPLE,2023-03-10,Apple shareholders reject proposals from conservative groups,"













March 10 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) shareholders on Friday rejected two proposals put forth by conservative U.S. groups focused on scrutinizing the iPhone maker's inclusion and diversity policies and its ties to China.

Shareholders meanwhile approved the company's executive pay packages, with 89% of votes cast in favor. In January, Apple reduced Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook's pay and made it more dependent on stock performance.

The unsuccessful diversity proposal, brought by the National Center for Public Policy Research, would have required Apple to consult right-leaning public interest groups in examining its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies.

""DEI is overtly bigoted against men, white people and straight people by falsely assuming that they are inherently — and irredeemably — racist and sexist oppressors,"" Ethan Peck, who presented the proposal, said in a statement.

Apple argued that the proposal mischaracterized its policies and said such an examination would be redundant because it is already conducting a civil rights audit. The proposal lost with 98.5% of shareholders who cast votes opposing it.

The National Legal and Policy Center, another conservative group, asked Apple to scrutinize its dependence on, and vulnerability to China. Apple recommended against the measure, saying that the iPhone maker already discloses a list of suppliers in China and information about human rights in an annual report. More than 95% of shareholders who cast votes opposed the measure.

While both those measures failed, shareholders re-elected Apple's board of directors and approved its use of Ernst & Young as its independent audit firm.

During a question-and-answer session with shareholders, Cook said that Apple continued to plan for dividend increases. On how Apple plans to respond to changing economic conditions, Cook noted that the company's operating expenses came in below its forecast during its most recently-reported quarter.

""But most important, and I can't stress this enough, we're continuing to invest in innovation, whatever the near-term economic picture looks like,"" Cook said during the meeting.

847,164,APPLE,2023-03-10,"Apple argues UK competition watchdog had ""no power"" to launch probe","













LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - Technology giant Apple (AAPL.O) on Friday told a London tribunal that Britain's competition watchdog had ""no power"" to launch a probe into its mobile browsers because it did so too late.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) opened a full investigation in November into cloud gaming and mobile browsers over concerns about restrictions by iPhone-maker Apple, as well as by Google (GOOGL.O).

Apple filed an appeal in January at the Competition Appeal Tribunal in London and argues the investigation is ""invalid"".

Its lawyer Timothy Otty said on Friday that the market investigation should by law have been opened last June at the same time as the CMA published a report on mobile ecosystems, which found the two tech giants had an ""effective duopoly"".

He added in court filings that Apple has ""suffered serious prejudice"" as a result of the CMA's decision, having ""had to repeatedly divert management time and technical resources away from its business activities"".

However, the CMA's lawyer James Eadie said the watchdog had complied with the legal time limits, because it initially decided not to open an investigation in December 2021.

He argued in court filings that a ruling that the investigation is invalid would cause ""significant prejudice to the public interest … which outweighs any burden shouldered by Apple"".

""A finding of invalidity would terminate the market investigation and leave unaddressed the CMA's concerns about the lack of competition for mobile browsers and cloud gaming,"" Eadie added.

Friday's hearing took place on the same day that the CMA said it was extending the deadline for its analysis and review into Apple's terms and conditions for app developers until May.
