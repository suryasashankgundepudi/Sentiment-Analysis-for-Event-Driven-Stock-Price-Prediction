WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - AT&T’s financial relationship with One America News is deeper than previously known and will continue even after DirecTV drops the far-right network from its satellite service next month, a new court filing shows.

The court filing, made as part of a lawsuit OAN filed against AT&T and DirecTV last week, reveals an exclusive contract for an AT&T subsidiary to sell commercials for OAN.

AT&T owns 70% of DirecTV, which announced in January it would drop OAN, a network known for promoting false 2020 election reports. The move came three months after Reuters revealed that AT&T played a pivotal role in creating OAN and has paid tens of millions of dollars to carry the network on DirecTV.

OAN’s lawsuit, which seeks $1 billion in damages, alleges that the removal of the network from the satellite service was politically inspired and “could be devastating” financially. Court records show that about 90% of OAN’s revenue is generated from its AT&T/DirecTV deals.

Robert Herring Sr, founder and CEO of San Diego-based Herring Networks, which owns OAN, did not respond to requests for comment. The lawsuit was filed March 7 by Herring Networks on behalf of OAN in state court in San Diego.

DirecTV and AT&T did not respond to specific queries from Reuters about the advertising pact, but issued statements about OAN’s lawsuit.

“These allegations are completely without merit,” AT&T said. The telecommunications giant denied OAN’s claim that the political beliefs of executives influenced the decision to drop the network. DirecTV called the lawsuit “baseless” and said it was “confident that we have fully complied both with the law and our agreement.”

After the Reuters report ran last year, AT&T issued a statement that said it “has never had a financial interest in OAN’s success.”

But the new lawsuit alleges that in addition to helping to create and distribute OAN, AT&T entered into the advertising deal with the network in 2019.

Under that deal, an AT&T subsidiary called Xandr is OAN’s sole advertising vendor and earns a commission on commercials aired by the network, the lawsuit alleges. A pending sale of Xandr to Microsoft will not include the portion of the company that sells commercials for DirecTV or OAN.

After DirecTV drops OAN, said a person familiar with the contract, the AT&T subsidiary will continue to serve as the advertising representative for OAN on other platforms, such as regional cable companies and cable and internet provider Verizon FIOS.

The pact to sell commercials is separate from the deal to air OAN on DirecTV, and does not expire until 2024.

In the lawsuit, Herring alleged that AT&T’s decision to drop OAN from DirecTV is “part and parcel of a larger, coordinated, extremely well-financed political scheme to take down Herring and unlawfully destroy its ability to operate in the media business.”

The business relationship between OAN and AT&T has become fodder for political activists on all sides.

Following the Reuters report about AT&T’s role in OAN’s creation, the NAACP and left-wing groups called for DirecTV to stop airing OAN. After DirecTV announced in January it would drop OAN, former President Donald Trump honored Herring at a rally and asked supporters who use DirecTV to cancel their subscriptions.

“It is a very popular channel, far more popular than most would understand, and they are being treated horribly by the Radical Left lunatics,” Trump said in a February statement.

In the lawsuit, Herring said OAN ranks in the top 10% of DirecTV programming, ahead of CNBC, Newsmax and CNN Headline News. Reuters could not independently verify this claim, and TV ratings services do not release OAN figures.

Herring, who amassed a fortune as a tech entrepreneur, launched OAN in 2013. His family-owned Herring Networks also owns a lifestyle and entertainment channel called AWE.

In the lawsuit, Herring said AT&T has earned “generous commissions via selling advertising on AWE and OAN.” The advertising deal called for AT&T to sell both traditional commercials, which every viewer sees, and targeted ads, which are tailored “to the individual viewer based on data known about the viewer.” The court filings don’t say how much revenue AT&T has garnered from the ad deal.

OAN alleged that after AT&T signed the advertising contract in 2019, the network “reasonably expected” this was “proof of a commitment” for a long term DirecTV deal, at least until 2024, when the ad contract expires. DirecTV’s decision to drop OAN, the lawsuit said, “stunned” Herring and damaged its reputation.

“AT&T and DirecTV signaled to the public that something was wrong, hurting OAN’s business and standing in the news media business,” the lawsuit said.

This is not the first time Herring has sued AT&T. In 2016, a Herring lawsuit alleged that AT&T reneged on an oral agreement to air OAN on DirecTV, a contention AT&T denied. About a month after that lawsuit was settled in 2017, OAN began airing on DirecTV.

1,499,Microsoft,2022-03-14,"Berkshire Hathaway stock price reaches $500,000","













March 14 (Reuters) - The share price of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) reached $500,000 for the first time on Monday, reflecting the company's status as a defensive stock in a market unsettled by events in Ukraine and rising inflation.

Berkshire's Class A shares have risen 10% in 2022, outpacing the Standard & Poor's 500 index (.SPX), which has fallen 12%.

The Omaha, Nebraska-based company's market value is approximately $731 billion, ranking sixth in the United States, and Buffett's 16.2% stake makes him the world's fifth-richest person at $119.2 billion, according to Forbes magazine.

Berkshire generated a record $27.46 billion of operating profit last year, including gains at Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy.

It also owns dozens of other businesses, including the fast-growing Clayton Homes mobile home unit and the largest U.S. residential real estate brokerage.

Berkshire specializes in ""on the ground, Main Street-esque business activity,"" said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management Inc in Phoenix, which invests about $4.3 billion and owns Berkshire stock.

""They're big and they're not a tech stock, and investors get comfort from that.""

Berkshire shares also slightly outperformed the S&P 500 in 2021, after lagging in 2019 and 2020. They closed up 0.8% on Monday at $493,785.

Most Berkshire operating units focus on the United States, and about 77% of its approximately 372,000 employees work there.

Among those expanding elsewhere is Dairy Queen, which plans by 2030 to add 600 stores in China, already its largest market outside the United States.

Berkshire traded below $20 when Buffett took over the then-struggling textile company in 1965. Its Class B shares are worth about 1/1500th of Class A shares.

U.S. companies with larger market capitalizations include Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Amazon.com Inc and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O). Apple is also Berkshire's largest common stock holding.

Berkshire ended 2021 with $146.7 billion in cash, though it has since invested well over $5 billion in Occidental Petroleum Corp as oil prices soared.

2,349,Microsoft,2022-03-15,ConsenSys valuation more than doubles to over $7 billion after latest funding,"













March 15 (Reuters) - Blockchain technology firm ConsenSys said on Tuesday its valuation had more than doubled to over $7 billion after its latest funding round that included investments from SoftBank Vision Fund 2 (9984.T) and Microsoft (MSFT.O).

ConsenSys, founded by Joseph Lubin, is an Ethereum blockchain firm whose products help developers, enterprises and users build applications geared towards the so-called ""Web3"" space.

""Web3"" is used to describe a potential next phase of the internet: a decentralized web run on the record-keeping technology blockchain.

The company, which raised $450 million in the latest round, said it would use the funds to expand its MetaMask offering with a redesign, expected to release later this year. MetaMask is a crypto wallet used to buy, sell and swap tokens.

Investors in the new round led by ParaFi Capital also included Singapore's Temasek, Anthos Capital, Sound Ventures and C Ventures.

ConsenSys said it intends to convert all funds from the round to ether (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, to rebalance the ratio of ETH to U.S. dollar-equivalents in line with the company's treasury strategy. Lubin has contributed heavily to the development of the cryptocurrency.

ConsenSys, which was valued at $3.2 billion in its last funding round in November, joins a growing list of crypto companies whose valuations have jumped in recent months driven by the explosion of interest in ""Web3"" and with the launch of marketplaces for non-fungible tokens (NFT).

Earlier this year, ""Web3"" developer platform Alchemy nearly tripled its valuation to $10.2 billion after a funding round led by Lightspeed and Silver Lake. read more

Summary Companies Airlines rise on forecasts

Energy shares fall as oil drops below $100 a barrel

Dow up 1.82%, S&P 500 up 2.14%, Nasdaq up 2.92%















NEW YORK, March 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on Tuesday and the S&P 500 ended a 3-day skid as another drop in oil prices and a softer-than-expected reading on producer prices helped ease inflation fears among investors, with the focus turning to the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy announcement.

Brent crude settled below $100 a barrel after rocketing higher to more than $139 last week, providing some temporary relief for equity investors that have seen stocks come under pressure this year from surging inflation concerns, uncertainty over the Fed's policy path to tame rising prices and more recently, escalating conflict in Ukraine. read more

U.S. producer prices increased solidly in February as the cost of goods like gasoline surged, and further gains are in the pipeline following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has made crude oil and other commodities more expensive. read more

Still, the data for the 12 months through February matched expectations predicting a 10% increase in producer prices, while the producer price index for final demand on a monthly basis increased 0.8%, just shy of the 0.9% estimate and lower than the 1.2% increase registered in January.

The market is now fully pricing in a rate hike of at least 25 basis points when the central bank makes its policy statement on Wednesday. Investors will also be closely watching the Fed's projections for the path of rate hikes this year and in coming years to rein in inflation.IRPR

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has recently floated multiple rate hikes this year as the Fed seeks to curb inflation.

""The fact is (PPI) was weaker than the expectation so therefore the idea that Jay Powell is right going 25 basis points seems to be the way the market feels today, that could change tomorrow,"" said Ken Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors in Boca Raton, Florida.

""The market is in a very oversold position, there are still going to be bumpy roads ahead but today could just be one of those snap-back rallies like we saw last week.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 599.1 points, or 1.82%, to 33,544.34, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 89.34 points, or 2.14%, to 4,262.45 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 367.40 points, or 2.92%, to 12,948.62.

The S&P 500 slumped about 2.4% in the prior three sessions and recently joined the Dow, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 (.RUT) in forming a ""death cross"" technical pattern, when a short-term moving average crosses below a longer-term moving average, which some investors believe signals more near-term weakness is likely.

Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors advanced, with technology (.SPLRCT) and consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) stocks leading the way while energy (.SPNY), the sole positive sector on the year, slumped nearly 4% on the day along with crude prices.

Megacap growth stocks gained with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) up 3.87% and Apple (AAPL.O) up 2.97%, providing the biggest boosts to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.

Meanwhile, investors also closely tracked a steep jump in daily COVID-19 infections in China for the possibility of denting global economic growth, and progress in Ukraine-Russia talks to end their weeks-long conflict. read more

In the latest hint at compromise, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Kyiv was prepared to accept security guarantees that stop short of its long-term objective of the NATO alliance membership, which Moscow opposes. read more

Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) gained 8.70% and United Airlines jumped 9.19% after the U.S. carriers raised their current-quarter revenue forecasts, even as they trimmed capacity. The Arca Airline index climbed 5.57%. read more

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 13.46 billion shares, compared with the 13.78 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.07-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.72-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 21 new highs and 386 new lows.

4,271,Microsoft,2022-03-16,EU's Vestager aims for March deal on tech rules,"













BRUSSELS, March 16 (Reuters) - The European Commission aims to clinch a fast-tracked deal with EU lawmakers and countries by the end of March on new rules to rein in the powers of Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google, Amazon , Apple (AAPL.O), Facebook (FB.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), Europe's antitrust chief said on Wednesday.

Margrethe Vestager, who had proposed the Digital Markets Act more than a year ago with a list of dos and don'ts for U.S. tech giants, said there has been good progress in negotiations.

""We are now aiming to reach political agreement by the fourth trilogue by the end of March. If we manage that, that will be legislation with almost the speed of lightning,"" she told a European Parliament hearing.

Talks are due to resume on March 24.

Issues that need to be ironed out include the list of obligations for online gatekeepers - companies that control data and access to their platforms - and the level of turnover that defines which companies will be covered by the DMA, people close to the matter said.

Another issue is whether the EU executive should be solely responsible for the proposed law's enforcement at the expense of national watchdogs.

5,559,Microsoft,2022-03-16,"Meet the company where staff work less, but produce more","













LYON, France, March 16 (Reuters) - When French company boss Laurent de la Clergerie decided to let his staff work a four-day week, on the same pay as before, he knew he risked hurting his bottom line. ""Some people took me for a crazy person,"" he recalled.

But a year on, he says the opposite has happened: his LDLC company selling consumer technology has increased its annual turnover by 40% without hiring any extra staff.

The secret, he said, is that the approximately 1,000 people his firm employs feel trusted and appreciated, and so they are more productive.

""At the end of the day, it's brought only good things for the team,"" said 51-year-old de la Clergerie.

As the world emerges from a pandemic that prompted many people to re-evaluate their work-life balance, companies and workers around the world are asking if, like de la Clergerie's firm, they could work less.

Microsoft (MSFT.O) gave its 2,300 Japan-based employees Fridays off in 2019, and said it saw productivity rise 40%. Consumer group Unilever (ULVR.L) launched a four-day week trial for local staff in New Zealand. Spanish telecoms company Telefonica (TEF.MC) has trialled a four-day week for 10% of its domestic workforce.

Johann Peters, who works in one of LDLC's stores near its headquarters in a suburb of Lyon, south-east France, uses the extra day off to head to the supermarket to pick up his weekly shopping. He then takes his daughter, 9-year-old Melissa, to her tennis practice.

""You come into work after your day off much more rested, and more efficient operationally,"" he said.

De la Clergerie said before he embarked on the change, he worked out that even in the worst case scenario, it would add to labour costs by at most 1.5 million euros per year. He said he felt that was a manageable risk.

Since then, he said that absenteeism and sick leaves were down, and that the company had not had to hire new people to offset the reduction in hours worked.

Though the four-day week was not the only factor involved, de la Clergerie said it had contributed to a jump in turnover from around 500 million euros before the change, to close to 700 million euros ($769.86 million) since then.

Celine Henniaux, a 36-year-old who works in one of the firm's distribution centres, said she had no desire to go back to the way things were before.

""No no,"" she said. ""We've got a taste for having a day off during the week.""

6,722,Microsoft,2022-03-16,Starbucks’ Schultz to return as CEO Johnson retires amid union battle,"













NEW YORK, March 16 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp's (SBUX.O) longtime former Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz will return to lead the company for the third time, taking over as interim CEO and driving strategy for dealing with a growing union drive at U.S. cafes.

Current chief executive Kevin Johnson will retire, and Starbucks will look for a new leader, the company said on Wednesday. Shares of the coffee chain were up 4.8%.

Schultz is practically synonymous with the company he took over in 1987. He expanded it into a coffee behemoth that made venti cappuccinos a global phenomenon.

""Schultz is a revered leader and uniquely well-qualified to steward"" the company, said Credit Suisse analyst Lauren Silberman. Schultz will receive $1 of compensation.

The board expects to have selected a new leader by the fall, with help from executive search firm Russell Reynolds Associates, which it enlisted in 2021. Schultz did not make an appearance during Wednesday's annual shareholder meeting.

Separately, shareholders voted down a proposal for the company to produce annual reports on the prevention of harassment and discrimination in the workplace.

Johnson signaled to the board of directors a year ago that he might retire when the COVID-19 pandemic waned, he said in a company statement.

Johnson, 61, has been at Starbucks for 13 years, the last five as CEO.

Johnson steered the company through the worst of the pandemic, when cafes around the world had to shutter temporarily. While sales initially nosedived, they roared back as customers shifted to to-go and drive-thru and placed orders on Starbucks' mobile app.

The company also shifted its approach to building new cafes and is now adding more smaller stores with less room for seating and more emphasis on to-go orders in urban areas, while adding more drive-thru space in suburban locations.

Under Johnson's watch, Starbucks also lifted wages for employees several times - before most other global restaurant chains. Hourly starting pay will range from $15 and $23 by this summer.

UNION PUSH

The success of the mobile app, however, led to long lines and overworked employees in some areas. That barista burnout, as well as accusations by some workers that they were not getting enough protection from the virus at work, contributed to a surge of union organizing in U.S. locations.

On Tuesday, a federal labor board accused Starbucks of unlawfully retaliating against two employees in a Phoenix, Arizona, cafe for trying to unionize their store.

[1/3] Starbucks' Howard Schultz looks on during its Annual Meeting of Shareholders in Seattle, Washington March 21, 2012. REUTERS/Robert Sorbo 1 2 3

The same day, a group of investors with $3.4 trillion under management urged the company to stop sending anti-union communications to its employees and to adopt a neutral policy towards unions.

The group, led by Trillium Asset Management and SOC Investment Group, said Starbucks risked damaging its positive reputation as a pro-employee brand by fighting the union.

Schultz has long said Starbucks did not need unions because it works so closely with employees, whom it calls ""partners.""

He has already had a run-in with Workers United, the union now representing employees at six stores. Employees at more than 140 stores in 27 states have asked for union elections in the last 7 months.

In November, Schultz spoke to employees who had been ordered to a large meeting with managers in Buffalo, where the first of Starbucks' 9,000 U.S. company locations were deciding whether to join the union.

In the meeting, Schultz likened Starbucks' pro-employee stance to Holocaust prisoners in concentration camps sharing blankets, according to media reports. The remarks led to backlash on social media. read more

""Schultz came to Buffalo to union-bust,"" wrote union organizer and barista Jaz Brisack on Twitter after the news on Wednesday. ""His takeover is another move in Starbucks' ideological war on unions.""

Johnson took the helm after Schultz resigned in 2017.

In a letter to employees on Wednesday, Johnson said that he has ""fond memories of making beverages together, laughing together, and sharing stories with one another.""

Starbucks will ""attract high-quality CEO candidates given its culture, global brand recognition and strong growth outlook,"" said BMO Capital Markets analyst Andrew Strelzik.

Because Johnson had previously worked in technology - at Microsoft and Juniper Networks - the board's search is likely to be broad. However, ""we prefer to see an incoming CEO with strong consumer industry experience,"" Strelzik said.

The CEOs of Domino's Pizza Inc and Wingstop Inc also resigned in the last two weeks.

Former Starbucks chief operating officer Troy Alstead, who left in 2016, ""was beloved by the investment community"" and ""ought to be on the short list"" for the CEO role, Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said.

Several internal candidates could be considered, but ""unionization publicity could be a factor pushing the company to look externally,"" Charles said.

7,835,Microsoft,2022-03-16,House Republicans who challenged Biden's win are losing lots of corporate cash,"[1/3] U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), stand after reading the final certification of Electoral College votes cast in November's presidential election during a joint session of Congress after working through the night, at the Capitol in Washington, U.S., January 7, 2021. J. Scott Applewhite/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo















WASHINGTON, March 16 (Reuters) - In the days after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, dozens of companies said they would suspend political donations to Republican lawmakers who had backed then-President Donald Trump's baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 election.

More than one year later, Republicans in the House of Representatives who voted to challenge the election results have so far collected about half as much corporate cash as they did at this point in the previous election cycle, a Reuters analysis of campaign finance records shows.

By contrast, corporate donations are up about 10% to House Republicans who voted to certify President Joe Biden's victory over Trump.

The results indicate that the corporate boycott is not just limited to the dozens of companies that announced a halt to donations after the attack. Hundreds more have also scaled back their support, the Reuters analysis shows.

The shift illustrates the growing gulf between business interests and the right wing of the Republican Party, which under Trump's presidency grew more anti-establishment and more open to curbs on global trade and technology that would have been anathema in previous years.

""You've got members that are increasingly unmoored from commercial corporate interests and are more responsive to either a small number of very wealthy, deep-pocketed donors, or a large number of culture war-activated base voters,"" said Jon Lieber, a former staffer for Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell now at the Eurasia Group, an analysis firm.

The drop in corporate donations is unlikely to affect Republican prospects in the November congressional elections. The party is favored to win control of the House and possibly the Senate, in part due to Biden's sagging popularity, and because few Republican incumbents face competitive races of their own.

Reuters analyzed the 2021 campaign finance disclosures of 142 House Republicans who are running for re-election in November and were in office throughout the last election cycle. The analysis included both re-election funds and those raised by leadership committees, which lawmakers use to finance other political activities. The analysis focused on the House of Representatives where most Republicans voted against certifying Biden's victory, compared to only eight Republicans in the Senate.

Fundraising by the House Republicans remains robust - about $200 million in 2021. Both objectors and non-objectors to Biden's win brought in more money than in 2019.

Corporate dollars - which don't come directly from company coffers but are contributed by employees to fundraising groups controlled by the corporations - made up about a tenth of that 2021 amount. Their role in campaign finance has diminished over the last decade as the advent of online fundraising has made it easy to solicit donations from rank-and-file voters. read more

Lawmakers who objected to Biden's 2020 victory raised around $9 million from corporate groups in 2021, less than half of the roughly $19 million raised in 2019. Corporate money raised by those who did not object rose to about $14 million last year from nearly $13 million in 2019.

NO REGRETS

Even before the Jan. 6 attack, many companies steered clear of some of the most confrontational partisans.

Representative Matt Gaetz, who frequently appeared on cable television to praise Trump, raised only about $30,000 from corporate sources in 2019, out of the $1 million he netted in total.

He took in no money from corporate political action committees (PACs) in 2021 after voting to challenge the election results - but he raised about $4 million overall. His office did not respond to a request for comment.

Others have taken a steeper hit.

Representative Mike Kelly, a senior member of the powerful tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, collected about $460,000 in corporate donations in 2019.

But after the Pennsylvania Republican launched an unsuccessful lawsuit to overturn Biden's victory in his state and voted against certifying the election result on Jan. 6, he took in just over $110,000 in corporate donations last year - about 75% less.

Melanie Brewer, Kelly's campaign manager, said he did not regret his vote.

""While fundraising was difficult for many Republicans in 2021, it was more important that he reflected the values and ideals of his district,"" she said.

The chamber's top two Republicans, Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise, also saw steep drops in their corporate donations after voting against the Jan. 6 results. Neither responded to a request for comment.

However, companies continue to give to Republican election accounts that will help the wider party, helping these accounts keep up with fundraising by Democrats.

The National Republican Congressional Committee raised $140 million overall in 2021, on par with the $146 million raised by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Both groups raised more in 2021 than in 2019.

TECH, FINANCE FIRMS CUT OFF SUPPORT

The drop in corporate support for those who challenged the election masks significant differences among industries.

Eight of the largest corporate donors ahead of the 2020 election have cut off donations entirely to those who challenged the election results, records show.

Those companies are all in technology, finance or consumer goods - Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Lowe's Companies Inc (LOW.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N) and General Electric Co .

All either did not respond to a request for comment or declined to comment. Most of them announced in early 2021 they were suspending contributions to those who challenged the election results.

Donating to those lawmakers ""could really incite a bunch of their key stakeholders - like employees, suppliers, customers and so on,"" said Russell Crook, an expert on corporate political activity at the University of Tennessee.

Some announced boycotts, only to abandon them.

Walmart Inc (WMT.N), which did not make any contributions in 2021 to the objectors, gave them $10,000 in January, split between McCarthy, Scalise and two others who voted against accepting the results.

Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said the company changed its stance because it felt it could better advocate for its interests ""by engaging with policymakers from both parties.""

By contrast, many defense contractors, whose profits depend on spending decisions made in Congress, have continued their support of all Republicans, whether or not they challenged the election results.

Two of them - Boeing Co (BA.N) and BAE Systems PLC (BAES.L) - actually increased their donations to those who voted to challenge the election.

Boeing did not respond to a request for comment and BAE declined to comment.

Rock Holdings Inc, the parent company of mortgage lender Rocket Mortgage, roughly doubled its contribution to objectors in 2021, to at least $97,000. The company did not respond to a request for comment.

Boeing, BAE and Rock also increased donations to those who did not object to the election result.

Some Republican lawmakers reacted angrily last year when corporate representatives told them they would not get their support, according to a Republican strategist who directs business donations to lawmakers.

But those tensions have eased in recent months as Republicans have grown more confident of victory and less interested in picking fights with possible allies, the strategist said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

OSLO, March 17 (Reuters) - Finnish utility Fortum (FORTUM.HE) said on Thursday it will use waste heat from two new Microsoft (MSFT.O) data centres to warm homes and businesses in and around the capital Helsinki, while also cutting carbon emissions.

Microsoft simultaneously announced plans for the construction of the data centres, which will be powered by renewable energy, with their location chosen to allow for recycling of heat created from the cooling of computer servers.

District heating is widely used in Finland, pumping hot water through pre-insulated underground pipes, and has traditionally relied on fossil fuel sources.

Fortum operates a system of underground pipes stretching 900 kilometres and serving 250,000 users in the Helsinki metropolitan area. Once completed, the data centres will account for 40% of the system's heat supplies, the two firms said.

Fortum said its investment for the heat capture side from the data centres was estimated at 200 million euros ($221 million), with expectations this would cut some 400,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.

Microsoft declined to say how much it would invest in the centres.

It estimated however that it would initially require some 400-500 gigawatt hours (GWh) of renewable energy per year, which it said was comparable in scope to other local industries such as a paper or pulp mill.

Microsoft plans to buy the electricity via one or several long-term power purchasing agreements (PPA), although no supplier has yet been selected, the company told Reuters.

PARIS, March 17 (Reuters) - U.S. tech giant Microsoft (MSFT.O) is facing an antitrust complaint filed by three European rivals in the booming cloud computing business, one the plaintiffs said on Thursday.

The complaint, filed with the European Union's competition watchdog months ago, alleges that Microsoft's contractual and business practices make it costly and difficult for users of its cloud computing services to opt for those of a competitor, a source close to the matter said.

French cloud computing services provider OVHcloud (OVH.PA) confirmed in a statement that it had joined the complaint against Microsoft. A spokesperson for the company declined to give the names of the two other European plaintiffs.

""Through abusing its dominant position, Microsoft undermines fair competition and limits consumer choice in the cloud computing services market,"" OVHcloud said.

The Wall Street Journal was first to report the news.

The European Commission confirmed that it had received a complaint, without elaborating.

""We're continuously evaluating how we can best support partners and make Microsoft software available to customers across all environments, including those of other cloud providers,"" a spokesperson for Microsoft said in response to an e-mail seeking comment.

10,411,Microsoft,2022-03-17,"GameStop posts quarterly loss on supply woes, Omicron hit","













March 17 (Reuters) - Video game retailer GameStop Corp (GME.N) on Thursday reported a net loss for the fourth quarter, as it absorbed high costs from supply constraints and also raised spending to pivot its largely brick-and-mortar business towards e-commerce.

The company's shares, which were at the heart of the 2021 meme stocks saga, fell 7% in extended trading.

""The combination of supply chain issues and the Omicron variant had a sizable impact on this past year's holiday season,"" Chief Executive Officer Matt Furlong said on an earnings conference call.

Usually, the holiday quarter is a strong one for the company as new Xboxes and Playstations are launched and demand is high. But component shortages and other supply chain issues, which had hit console makers like Sony (6758.T) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), impacted GameStop's business.

Like many other retailers, GameStop has already suffered as the pandemic wreaked havoc with curbs leading to store closures. The spread of the Omicron variant further exacerbated the situation.

The company's net sales rose 6.2% to $1.88 billion, while its gross profit fell 15.7% during the quarter ended Jan. 29.

Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter noted that the company's gross profit fell ""due to exceptionally poor gross margins.""

""It's likely that used game sales were low and lower margin than normal and that hardware sales were higher than normal.""

GameStop has also been ramping up spending to hire talent, expand capacity, grow its e-commerce presence and also introduce new products to boost its digital presence.

The company on Thursday also said it intends to launch its marketplace for non-fungible tokens or NFTs by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2022.

The company posted a net loss of $147.5 million, or $1.94 per share, during the quarter, compared with a profit of $80.5 million, or $1.19 per share, a year earlier.

11,801,Microsoft,2022-03-18,"Exclusive: Veon employees in bomb shelters keep Ukraine's biggest mobile network up, CEO says","













STOCKHOLM/AMSTERDAM, March 18 (Reuters) - Thousands of telecom operator Veon employees are working from bomb shelters in Ukraine and moving equipment to border areas to maintain a digital lifeline for refugees fleeing the war, the company's chief executive said on Friday.

Their work has helped some 85% of Veon's telecom network remain operational in Ukraine since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion, Veon CEO Kaan Terzioglu said in an exclusive interview with Reuters. But further risks loom both from electricity shortages and the conflict itself.

Amsterdam-listed Veon operates Ukraine's biggest cell phone provider under the name Kyivstar with 4,000 employees and a 25% market share.

Terzioglu, who spoke by Zoom conference call from the Netherlands, described how the company is coping with war, sanctions and financial concerns at the same time.

Terzioglu provided a lens through which one company is providing a phone network to a rapidly spreading diaspora.

Employees ""are practically working out of shelters and the moment they have the opportunity, they go out to the field to do maintenance,"" Terzioglu said.

The parts of the network which are not working were mostly because of loss of power and are not being targeted by Russian forces, he said. Getting these parts back up required workers to run gasoline to generators, which Terioglu described as ""one of the most logistically heavy jobs that our people are trying to do.""

Russia's attack, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarize the country, has killed hundreds of civilians, reduced city areas to rubble and sparked a humanitarian crisis. Russia denies targeting civilians in the country of about 44 million.

More than 3.2 million people have fled and an additional 2 million have been displaced internally, United Nations data showed.

On the basis of cell phone data, Terzioglu estimated that 4 million refugees had left, and 10 million were displaced.

Apart from opening up its offices as refugee shelters, Veon has also topped up mobile accounts without charge, said Terzioglu, who became Veon's group CEO last July. In his previous job as Turkcell CEO he grappled with the Syrian refugee crisis.

Veon has also received support from American, Chinese and European companies in the tech and telecom industry. While operators such as Orange, Tele2 and Vodafone have waived off interconnection and roaming charges, equipment makers such as Huawei and ZTE have been helping in network maintenance. These and companies including Ericsson, Nokia, Microsoft and Oracle have made a ""heroic effort"" to keep the networks running, Terzioglu said.

RUSSIAN CONNECTION

Veon also owns the second-largest telecom network in Russia, operating under the name of Beeline, its most profitable market. That means Veon must navigate the impact of sanctions and political concerns on both sides of the border.

Veon has about 29,000 employees in Russia and the company has taken steps to operate its Ukraine and Russian businesses as separate from one another.

The company has also moved quickly to distance itself from Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman, whose investment vehicle LetterOne holds a 47.9% stake in Veon, and an additional 8.3% economic stake through a Dutch foundation.

The European Union imposed sanctions on Fridman on Feb. 28, a decision he said he would fight.

Terzioglu said Fridman, who resigned from Veon's board Feb. 28 and LetterOne's board on March 3, now ""has no economic interest in LetterOne.""

LetterOne, which did not respond to a request for comment, said March 3 that Fridman's assets had been frozen and he had been stripped of shareholder rights.

Terzioglu said he could not speculate as to whether the company could eventually face EU sanctions or nationalization by the Russian government, but he hoped that it would be excluded on humanitarian grounds.

""We will do our best to position it as a service that is essential,"" he said.

Veon also faces financial worries, with its shares down 56% in the year to date, and its U.S. dollar denominated debt - $5.4 billion worth at the end of 2021 - trading at distressed levels.

On March 4, Fitch downgraded the company's credit ratings to junk status, saying that together Russia and Ukraine accounted for 62% of 2021 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $3.3 billion.

Russian capital controls and the war meant the company may not be able to move funds in or out of either country.

The company has issued several updates to reassure investors it remains liquid, with $2.1 billion in cash as of the end of February, of which $1.5 billion is in the Netherlands.

Terzioglu said he was aware of reports of a group of bondholders seeking talks and welcomed the opportunity to address them, though none have reached the company so far.

""Having them organized gives us the opportunity to explain why they should not be worried, and that we are well funded in terms of meeting our obligations,"" he said.

REUTERS/Heather Somerville/File Photo/File Photo















WASHINGTON, March 18 (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp's (9984.T) Vision Fund exited its bet on General Motors (GM) (GM.N) self-driving car subsidiary Cruise as the auto giant upped the ante, investing another $3.45 billion in the loss-making unit.

SoftBank's departure, which comes as the Japanese conglomerate struggles with debts, prompted questions from sector watchers about whether Cruise is ready to generate meaningful revenue for the time being, and how deep GM might have to dig to fund development.

GM said on Friday that it has agreed to pay $2.1 billion to buy the SoftBank Vision Fund stake in Cruise, and to make a separate $1.35 billion investment in the unit that SoftBank had committed to make in 2018.

Combined, the transactions will bring GM's stake in Cruise to 80%, GM said. Other remaining shareholders in Cruise include Microsoft (MSFT.O), Walmart (WMT.N) and Honda Motor Co (7267.T).

In 2018, SoftBank invested $900 million in Cruise and said it would invest another $1.35 billion when Cruise's autonomous vehicles were ready for commercial deployment, potentially bringing its stake to 20%.

As recently as last month, Cruise said SoftBank would invest the $1.35 billion in the company as outlined in 2018.

A person briefed on the matter said SoftBank, including follow-on fundraising rounds after 2018, invested about $1.2 billion in Cruise in total. The person declined to be identified because the information was not public.

The SoftBank exit comes as Cruise awaits a regulatory permit to allow it to charge riders for a driverless ride-hailing service launched in San Francisco. read more

""Based on the experience that we have seen from Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Waymo in Arizona, the revenue that you will generate from that deployment will be very, very small,"" said Raj Rajkumar, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, referring to a project developed by the parent of Google. read more

""It is a long road ahead,"" he said, adding that GM and partners like Honda may have to ""dig deep into their pockets"" to fund the unit for the time being.

SoftBank has its own internal problems to deal with.

The value of marquee companies in the tech investor's portfolio have tumbled, hit by China's crackdown on tech companies, the prospect of higher interest rates and war in Ukraine.

""We will definitely be selling a good chunk of assets,"" SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said last month, as he pivots from the collapse of the sale of chip designer Arm to a plan to list it in the United States.

SoftBank declined to comment on the Cruise exit.

In a statement, GM CEO Marry Barra said, ""GM is leveraging the strength of its balance sheet to capitalise on the opportunity to increase its equity investment in Cruise and advance our integrated autonomous vehicle strategy.""

Kyle Vogt, CEO and co-founder of Cruise, said in a series of tweets that Cruise would begin allowing employees to sell vested shares to GM once a quarter in an effort to give financial flexibility to employees.

Going public would be ""a major distraction, especially right now,"" he said, adding he wanted the company focused on scaling up the driverless ride-hail service launched in San Francisco.

In December, GM announced that Dan Ammann, then chief executive of Cruise, was abruptly leaving the company. One person briefed on the matter said he was dismissed, while another source said he and GM disagreed over when to take Cruise public.

Barra previously downplayed the need for a quick Cruise public offering.

GM spokesman David Caldwell said the latest deal showed GM's belief in Cruise and simplified the ownership structure. He said that other shareholders in Cruise including Microsoft, Walmart and Honda, had technology partnerships, such as a delivery project with Walmart.

March 21 (Reuters) - Major Gulf bourses were mixed in trading on Monday, with Saudi Arabia's benchmark index (.TASI) rising a day after oil giant Saudi Aramco (2222.SE) posted a surge in annual profit.

Across the globe, share markets were in a sober mood as fighting in Ukraine raged on with no sign of stopping, leaving investors clutching at hopes for an eventual peace deal, while oil prices climbed anew as supplies remained tight.

Oil prices jumped $3 on Monday, with Brent above $110 a barrel, as European Union nations consider joining the United States in a Russian oil embargo, while a weekend attack on Saudi oil facilities caused jitters.

Saudi Arabia's benchmark index (.TASI) advanced 0.4%, with state-run Saudi Aramco (2222.SE) up 0.8%, valuing it at 8.65 trillion riyals ($2.31 trillion).

The oil giant had risen over 4% on Sunday after posting a near double annual profit. read more

The jump in stock took Aramco's valuation to 8.76 trillion riyals, or the equivalent of $2.34 trillion, more than that of Microsoft (MSFT.O) but still behind Apple's (AAPL.O) $2.68 trillion.

Abdullah Al Othaim Markets (4001.SE) fell 1.9% after it began trading ex-dividend.

The Abu Dhabi index (.FTFADGI) fell for the second consecutive session, down 0.3%.

Dubai's main share index (.DFMGI) was trading 0.3% higher, boosted by financials and industrials.

Emirates NBD Bank (ENBD.DU) was up 2.2% while Dubai Investments PJSC (DINV.DU) was up 3.5%.

The Qatari index (.QSI) was nearly flat, up 0.1%.

Shares of Commercial Bank (COMB.QA) were up 1.1%, after the company's shareholders approved raising foreign ownership limit to 100%.

Summary Law firms Rule Garza Howley launches with attorneys from Paul Weiss, Covington & Burling, Debevoise & Plimpton and Johnson & Johnson

Specialized antitrust firm will reduce conflicts and boost efficiency, says founder Charles “Rick” Rule















(Reuters) - Charles “Rick” Rule, co-chair of the antitrust group at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison and a former top antitrust prosecutor, has left the corporate and litigation law firm to establish a new antitrust firm focused on M&A and government investigations.

Joining him at newly formed, Washington D.C.-based Rule Garza Howley LLP are Deborah Garza, who was previously senior counsel at Covington & Burling and served in the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division, and Paul Weiss antitrust counsel Dan Howley.

The new firm also includes partners William Dolan, previously an associate at Debevoise & Plimpton, and former Johnson & Johnson senior counsel for competition law Margot Campbell.

The move comes amid heightened scrutiny of mergers by the Biden Administration, which has ramped up demand for antitrust lawyers. Major firms including Jones Day; Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe; and Ropes & Gray have bulked up their antitrust practices in recent months.

Rule, who joined Paul Weiss in 2016 from Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft, led the Justice Department’s antitrust division under President Ronald Reagan. In private practice he advised Microsoft in its acquisitions of LinkedIn and Skype. He also represented US Airways in its 2013 merger with American Airlines and Pfizer in its $68 billion acquisition of Wyeth.

Rule and Garza said in an interview that starting a small firm dedicated to antitrust will enable them to be more flexible and efficient than at large, full-service law firms that have high overhead. It will also reduce client conflicts, they said.

""If you have a small, nimble team that's highly focused and very experienced, we're going to be in a really good position to help clients navigate these areas,"" Rule said.

Paul Weiss has about 900 attorneys in nine offices, according to its website. The firm's corporate chair Scott Barshay called Rule a ""terrific partner"" and said the firm wished him well. Representatives from Covington & Burling and Johnson & Johnson did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the other departures.

The partners at Rule Garza Howley have advised on deals with a combined $1 trillion in value and have had a hand in some of the biggest transactions to come before the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, the firm said.

Rosen co-leads national security practice at Crowell

Nominee's clients included Amazon, Barclays and Microsoft















(Reuters) - Paul Rosen, co-leader of the national security practice at Crowell & Moring, earned more than $1 million in partner compensation, according to a financial disclosure released on Monday as part of his nomination to a top U.S. Treasury Department post.

Rosen, nominated on March 8 to serve as assistant secretary of the Treasury for investment security, joined Washington, D.C.-based Crowell in 2017 from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Rosen had served as chief of staff to Obama-era DHS head Jeh Johnson, now a partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.

Financial disclosures are mandatory public ethics filings for many U.S. agency nominees and top officials, and they can offer a snapshot of compensation at law firms, companies and law schools. They record income received from the prior calendar year up to the filing. Rosen reported receiving $1,018,070 from Crowell.

Rosen's disclosure showed he provided legal services to Crowell clients including Amazon.com Inc, Barclays PLC, Microsoft Corp, Raytheon Technologies Corp, Cardinal Health Inc and HP Inc. He said he could not disclose the names of four individuals who are subject to non-public grand jury investigations.

Newly arriving attorneys at federal agencies are generally barred from touching matters involving former clients for at least a year.

Rosen did not immediately return a message on Monday seeking comment. His nomination is pending at the U.S. Senate banking committee.

Revenue per lawyer at Crowell, with more than 500 attorneys, reached $1.1 million in 2020, according to a report last year from The American Lawyer. The report said profits per partner at Crowell were $1.6 million. The basic pay for an assistant secretary at Treasury is about $176,000.

Rosen, also a former federal prosecutor, would oversee Treasury's role on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the interagency body that reviews certain U.S. business transactions that involve foreign investment.

In 2019, former Alston & Bird international trade partner Thomas Feddo became the first official to hold the post, created as part of an overhaul of the CFIUS process. Feddo is now a senior advisor at the financial strategy company Capstone DC.

Rosen said on an ethics agreement that accompanied his financial disclosure that he would resign on confirmation from the board of governors of California's Association of Business Trial Lawyers and from his post on the board of directors of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.

10-year Treasury yields hit highest level since 2019

Oil declines after Monday's surge

Gold dips, bitcoin advances















BOSTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Treasury yields marched higher on Tuesday, bringing U.S. stocks with them, as investors digested the increased likelihood of swift interest rate hikes following hawkish comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve.

The Nasdaq (.IXIC) led Wall Street's main indexes higher, rising nearly 2%, as investors bought the dip in technology stocks, including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O). read more

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 254.87 points, or 0.74%, to 34,807.86 and the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 50.63 points, or 1.13%, to 4,511.81.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Monday the central bank could move ""more aggressively"" to raise rates to fight inflation, possibly hiking by more than 25 basis points at one or more meetings this year. read more

The market is pricing in a 72.2% probability that the Fed will hike the fed fund rate 50 basis points when policymakers meet in May, up from a probability of just over 50% on Monday.

At around 2000 GMT, or 4:00 p.m. ET, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.38%, having hit its highest level since 2019 . The 2-year note also ticked up, to yield 2.16%, from 2.13%.

“The degree of difficulty for Jerome Powell’s Fed to stick a soft landing for the economy is about the same as Captain Sullenberger’s heroic emergency landing on the Hudson River,"" said Aaron Clark, a portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management in Boston, referring to the 2009 landing of a US Airways plane after its engines failed.

""The market remains in a tug of war between a policy error causing a recession and a resilient economy with a strong consumer and corporate sector,"" Clark wrote in an email.

Stocks also rose in Europe. The STOXX 600 (.STOXX) gained 0.85%, having climbed in recent sessions to reach a one-month high. London's FTSE 100 (.FTSE) gained nearly 0.5%. read more

The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, was up approximately 1.1% (.MIWD00000PUS).

Matthias Scheiber, global head of multiasset portfolio management at Allspring Global Investments in London, said the pickup in stocks could be a case of investors buying the dip, but that growth stocks would struggle if the U.S. 10-year yield moves closer to 2.5%.

""We saw the sharp rise in yields yesterday and we see that continuing today on the long end, so that’s likely to put pressure on equities. ... It will be hard for equities to have a positive performance.""

JPMorgan took a different view and said that 80% of its clients plan to increase equity exposure, which is a record high.

""With positioning light, sentiment weak and geopolitical risks likely to ease over time, we believe risks are skewed to the upside,"" JPMorgan strategists wrote in a note to clients.

""We believe investors should add risk in areas that overshot on the downside such as innovation, tech, biotech, EM/China, and small caps. These segments are pricing in a severe global recession, which will not materialize, in our view.""

The conflict in Ukraine continued to weigh on sentiment. Russia, the U.S. and Britain traded accusations at the United Nations on Tuesday over the possibility of a chemical weapons attack in Ukraine, but none produced any evidence to back their concerns. read more

Oil prices pulled back less than 1% on Tuesday as the dollar strengthened and it looked unlikely that the European Union would pursue an embargo on Russian oil, a day after prices jumped 7% and also rose earlier in the session. read more

19,603,Microsoft,2022-03-22,"EU’s faster, harder stick will whack U.S. big tech","













NEW YORK, March 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Regulators around the world have been trying to crack into the dominance that big technology firms like Apple (AAPL.O) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) have created. So far, they have been too slow and toothless to prevent them from growing. Europe’s Digital Markets Act, which might be agreed upon this month read more according to European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager, gets closer to changing that.

Scale creates momentum at technology firms through aspects like networks effects. The more people use a site, like Meta Platforms’ (FB.O) Facebook, for example, the more others want to engage. Often that scale helps profit, too, as upfront costs to penetrate a market with new tech can be high. The payoff comes when a company gains market share and momentum, so tech firms are motivated to push for a monopoly as fast as possible.

Regulators are often behind. They work at a slower pace by nature, but also heading off a monopoly at a tech company before it is established is nearly impossible. And because innovative tech, by definition, is new, regulators are often forced to redefine markets before they can crack down.

So far attempts to dent tech firms’ dominance haven’t worked. Take Alphabet’s fight with the European Commission, which started in 2010. It resulted in nearly $10 billion in fines, but the firm’s operating profit grew seven-fold since that period, to over $300 billion. Moreover, Alphabet has yet to actually pay those fines, and Google retains about 90% of the European search market.

The proposed rules in Europe impose a set of “do and don’t” obligations, like saying companies cannot prefer their own products or services and must allow interoperability with third-party software. The exact limitations and penalties are still under discussion, but firms that break such rules might be fined up to 20% of annual revenue and repeat offenders may be broken up. These are solid threats more damaging than other penalties read more that have been enacted.

Compliance will be costly. If apps become available outside Apple’s store, its margins could fall. Amazon.com’s (AMZN.O) own-label products might see slower expansion, and Alphabet’s users may click away from Google more often.

Yet Europe is a huge market, making up roughly a quarter of revenue at Apple. So companies don’t have the option to walk away. Vestager may ultimately not be able to enforce as stringently as she would like, but she’s getting much closer to cracking big tech’s dominance.

CONTEXT NEWS

- New European Union legislation that reins in the powers of Alphabet’s Google, Amazon.com, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft could be completed by the end of March, European antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on March 16.

- The Digital Markets Act imposes “do and don’t” obligations on so-called “gatekeeper firms” such as saying the companies cannot prefer their own products or services and must allow interoperability with third-party software.

- Issues still under discussion include the thresholds at which firms become gatekeepers, what interoperability entails, and penalties.

- Companies that don’t comply could be fined. The European Parliament has proposed fines ranging from 4% to 20% of worldwide revenue under the Act. Gatekeepers that systematically violate their obligations may be required to divest businesses.

Tesla shares rally on German-made car delivery

Indexes: Dow up 0.7%, S&P 500 up 1.1%, Nasdaq up 2%















NEW YORK, March 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended higher on Tuesday, led by a 2% gain in the Nasdaq, as shares of technology and other big growth names rebounded from recent losses and Nike rose after it reported upbeat results.

Financial shares also were among the day's best performers as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 2.368%, with the S&P 500 bank index (.SPXBK) up 2.5%.

Every S&P 500 sector but energy (.SPNY) ended higher on the day. The three major indexes have gained in five of the last six sessions.

The Federal Reserve last week raised the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point from the near-zero level, and Fed officials are doing little to downplay rising market expectations the U.S. central bank will raise rates by half a percentage point in May to tame inflation. read more

While higher borrowing costs are a negative for consumers and many businesses, they help to boost the profit outlook for banks.

Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) gave the biggest boosts to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. The S&P 500 technology index (.SPLRCT) rose 1.4% on the day, but remained down 10% for the quarter so far, among the sharpest declines of the major sectors.

With the recent lows, ""you sort of really did wash out the sellers,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. ""Now you're seeing even the old leadership bounce a little bit, giving people a little support that maybe the worst is over.

""Underneath all of it is that economic and earnings data have remained fairly good.""

21,408,Microsoft,2022-03-22,"Hackers hit authentication firm Okta, customers 'may have been impacted'","













WASHINGTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Okta Inc (OKTA.O), whose authentication services are used by companies including Fedex Corp (FDX.N) and Moody's Corp (MCO.N) to provide access to their networks, said on Tuesday that it had been hit by hackers and that some customers may have been affected.

The scope of the breach is still unclear, but it could have major consequences because thousands of companies rely on San Francisco-based Okta to manage access to their networks and applications. read more

Chief Security Officer David Bradbury said in a blog post that a customer support engineer working for a third-party contractor had his computer accessed by the hackers for a five-day period in mid-January and that ""the potential impact to Okta customers is limited to the access that support engineers have.""

""There are no corrective actions that need to be taken by our customers,"" he said.

Nevertheless, Bradbury acknowledged that support engineers were able to help reset passwords and that some customers ""may have been impacted."" He said the company was in the process of identifying and contacting them.

The nature of that impact wasn't clear and Okta did not immediately respond to an email asking how many organizations were potentially affected or how that squared with Okta's advice that customers did not need to take corrective action.

The company's shares were down 1.3% at $167.14 in late afternoon trading, off earlier lows.

On its website, Okta describes itself as the ""identity provider for the internet"" and says it has more than 15,000 customers on its platform.

It competes with the likes of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), PingID, Duo, SecureAuth and IBM (IBM.N) to provide identity services such as single sign-on and multifactor authentication used to help users securely access online applications and websites.

'BE VERY VIGILANT'

Okta's statement follows the posting of a series of screenshots of Okta's internal communications by a group of ransom-seeking hackers known as Lapsus$ on their Telegram channel late on Monday.

In an accompanying message, the group said its focus was ""ONLY on Okta customers.""

Lapsus$ responded to Okta's statement on Tuesday by saying the company was trying to minimize the importance of the breach.

Some outside observers weren't impressed with Okta's explanation either.

""In my opinion, it looks like they're trying to downplay the attack as much as possible, going as far as directly contradicting themselves in their own statements,"" said Bill Demirkapi, an independent security researcher.

Dan Tentler, the founder of cybersecurity consultancy Phobos Group, earlier told Reuters that Okta customers should ""be very vigilant right now.""

There were already signs that Okta customers were taking action to revisit their security.

Web infrastructure company Cloudflare issued a detailed explanation of how it reacted to the Okta breach and saying the company did not believe it had been compromised as a result.

FedEx said in a statement that it too was investigating and ""we currently have no indication that our environment has been accessed or compromised."" Moody's did not return a message seeking comment.

Lapsus$ is a relatively new entrant to the crowded ransomware market but has already made waves with high-profile hacks and attention-seeking behavior.

The group compromised the websites of Portuguese media conglomerate Impresa earlier this year, tweeting the phrase ""Lapsus$ is now the new president of Portugal"" from one newspaper's Twitter accounts. The Impresa-owned media outlets described the hack as an assault on press freedom. read more

Last month, the group leaked proprietary information about U.S. chipmaker Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) to the Web. read more

More recently the group has purported to have leaked source code from several big tech firms, including Microsoft. In a blog post published Tuesday and devoted to Lapsus$, the software firm confirmed that one of its accounts had been compromised, ""gaining limited access.""

The hackers did not respond to a message left on their Telegram group chat seeking comment.

March 22 (Reuters) - San Francisco-based Okta Inc (OKTA.O), a widely used access management company that competes with the likes of PingID and Duo to provide online authentication services, said it was investigating a digital breach on Tuesday.

The scope of the breach is unknown, but a hack at Okta could have major consequences because thousands of other companies rely on the firm to manage access to their own networks and applications. Okta said the breach could be connected to an earlier incident in January. read more

Here are some facts about the company:

According to its website, Okta has been in business since 2009 and describes itself as the ""identity provider for the internet."" It says it has more than 15,000 customers on its platform.

Okta sells identity services, such as Single Sign-On and Multi-factor Authentication used to log in to online applications and websites.

Hundreds of large companies, such as FedEx Corp (FDX.N), T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O), Moody's Corp (MCO.N) and Coinbase Global Inc (COIN.O), use Okta's services.

Global cloud services provider Cloudflare Inc (NET.N) also uses Okta. Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said in a tweet that the company had reset the credentials of some employees ""out of (an) abundance of caution"" but had ""confirmed no compromise.""

In a 2019 interview with CNBC, Okta's CEO, Todd McKinnon, said the company had more than 100 million registered users.

Okta competes with the likes of PingID, Duo, SecureAuth, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and IBM (IBM.N). While known for offering employee identification systems, Okta has been expanding its customer identification business, which now accounts for a quarter of revenue.

Earlier this month, Okta said it had agreed to buy its smaller rival Autho in a $6.5 billion all-stock deal, one of the largest software deals so far this year. read more

Okta reported quarterly revenue of $234.7 million in March, an increase of 40%. The company's share price has jumped during the pandemic, taking the company's market cap to over $30 billion.

Companies Law firms LinkedIn Follow

Microsoft Follow















While the impact of the pandemic on how law firms and their attorneys work has been extensively covered for the past two years, relatively little attention has been paid to managing and interacting with legal technology professionals who support these lawyers, despite the unique aspects and characteristics of those working in the technical field.

However disparate legal professionals and legal technologists might be, these two groups do have one common thread, which is the importance of communication and collaboration, especially considering the current tight labor market in general and the technology sector specifically.

<b>Foster alternative avenues of communication and engagement</b>

Different types of individuals are comfortable with eyes on them in the courtroom versus those who train their eyes on a computer screen for hours on end. By nature, many technologists are introverts at heart.

Engineers responsible for the security of a law firm network, those in programming or support roles, or others responsible for the technical operations in areas such as e-discovery aren’t usually spending a lot of time on the phone or in meetings with their co-workers. Even the time around the coffee machine for casual conversations has ceased to exist in a world in which the typical employee now rolls out of bed and hops on their computer to work on system implementation tasks without a scintilla of human interaction.

So, what can law firm leaders do to better integrate technical resources and keep their legal tech crews engaged? One tactic I’ve observed that seems to work well in the software industry is literally encouraging daytime ongoing chats on technologies like Teams or Zoom. While chatting might sound like time-wasting to many traditional managers, in today’s unique work environments, it really is not. It seems to be a great boost for morale and, like the water cooler before it, allows for the exchange of verbal ideas relating to the problems of the day.

Additionally, if your firm has not already done so, creating funding pools for things like docking stations, ergonomic equipment, multiple monitors, high-quality headsets, and the like might be even more appreciated in the technology domain than for those with legal-oriented careers — not that everyone would not enjoy a morale lift with offerings of that nature. On that note, don’t leave your tech staff out of the loop for appreciation swag or shipments of other items like home care products to personally show interest and care in your team members. The seemingly small gesture is a great idea to keep technology folks engaged.

Finally, in my opinion, there is an even greater need to be flexible in work arrangements for technology professionals than with others in the legal domain. Many of the workers are younger and early in their careers, so this is a model they have grown accustomed to. And, importantly, there is a wide disparity in skill sets even within the range of a defined job, so anything a law firm or corporate law department can do to meet employee’s desired work arrangements almost certainly will result in an uptick in performance. In my view, flexibility is good business.

<b>Employee development</b>

Firms should also not overlook factors that have traditionally been key points for legal technologist as well. Training, for example, can be a huge differentiator in helping to recruit and retain top-tier technical talent within a law firm.

The challenge here might be the mindset. Within legal, training is an often considered a requirement for lawyers — think the need to amass CLE hours to maintain one’s license. For technologists, however, it is often a joy to learn and expand one’s practical skills. Indeed, for legal tech professionals such training is really a necessity due to the rapidly changing dynamics of the tools of the trade.

Carving out time for training, frequent discussions with team members on the skills and certifications they wish to pursue and partnering with your folks to get their development train rolling are all excellent ways to continue close working partnerships with your legal tech team, regardless of whether you are physically all together.

Encouraging other technologists to connect via LinkedIn Learning, leverage free training offered by companies like Oracle or Microsoft, or avail themselves of all the excellent content and programs offered by the International Legal Technology Association (ILTA) are all useful specific suggestions to help employees get their own ball rolling.

<b>Compensation & work/life balance</b>

There is a strong tendency for technologists, like any employee, to blur the lines between work and home when they are, physically at least, one and the same. This is a challenging area to address because, by nature, many technologists have support-oriented roles. Simply saying “don’t work weekends or evenings” sounds good, but often is not practical or sometimes even unfair if not everyone takes heed.

Better approaches include deep integration of external support-oriented entities (like a Help Desk or Managed Services Provider), ensuring your employees that they can do their job off-hours, and working with service providers to try to raise the bar when they return seemingly basic issues “back over the wall” rather than the service provider handling the issues themselves.

Other ideas — which may or may not work, depending on the size of your teams — could be ideas like having an engineer-on-call where others are specifically not on call and thus truly “off-duty” during these periods; or negotiating service legal agreements with internal staff for off-hours issues so not every issue encountered at 3 pm on a Sunday afternoon is considered a “fire drill” with an understanding of course that some issues are, in fact, urgent.

<b>Conclusion</b>

Firm leaders should understand the need for specific strategies for how to support, promote, and partner with legal technologists during times of changing and challenging workplace dynamics. What works well for attorneys, paralegals, or legal operations professionals, not surprisingly, probably benefits from a touch of tweaking for technologists. And those firms that follow some of these suggestions might help those professionals who are overseeing firms’ legal technology efforts.

BRUSSELS, March 24 (Reuters) - Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google, Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Meta (FB.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) may have to change their core business practices in Europe as EU countries and EU lawmakers on Thursday clinched a deal on landmark rules to curb their powers.

France, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said in a tweet that there was a provisional agreement after eight hours of talks.

EU industry chief Thierry Breton said in a tweet that the deal would ensure fair and open digital markets.

""What we want is simple: fair markets also in digital. Large gatekeeper platforms have prevented businesses and consumers from the benefit of competitive digital markets,"" EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, who proposed the rules just over a year ago, said in a statement.

""This means that the time of long antitrust cases, during which the authorities were lagging behind the big tech companies, is over,"" said EU lawmaker Andreas Schwab, who had steered the debate in the European Parliament.

The Digital Markets Act (DMA) sets out rules for online gatekeepers - companies that control data and platform access.

It will cover gatekeepers in online intermediation services, social networks, search engines, operating systems, online advertising services, cloud computing, video-sharing services, web browsers and virtual assistants.

Under the DMA, the tech giants will have to make their messaging services interoperable and provide business users access to their data. Business users would be able to promote competing products and services on a platform and reach deals with customers off the platforms.

The rules prohibit the companies from favoring their own services over rivals' or preventing users from removing pre-installed software or apps.

The DMA will apply to companies with a market capitalisation of 75 billion euros, 7.5 billion euros in annual turnover and at least 45 million monthly users.

Companies face hefty fines up to 10% of their annual global turnover for breaching the rules and as much as 20% for repeat offences.

Apple, which has lobbied intensively against the DMA, reiterated its worries.

""We remain concerned that some provisions of the DMA will create unnecessary privacy and security vulnerabilities for our users while others will prohibit us from charging for intellectual property in which we invest a great deal,"" it said in a statement.

Google, which also cranked up its lobbying in the last year, echoed the same sentiments.

""While we support many of the DMA's ambitions around consumer choice and interoperability, we're worried that some of these rules could reduce innovation and the choice available to Europeans. We'll now take some time to study the final text, talk with the regulator and work out what we need to do to comply,"" it said in a statement.

25,422,Microsoft,2022-03-24,Mining firm backed by Bezos and Gates to begin Greenland drilling,"













COPENHAGEN, March 24 (Reuters) - Mineral exploration company KoBold Metals, backed by billionaires including Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, said on Thursday it would begin drilling in Greenland for critical materials used in electric vehicles.

KoBold, which uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to hunt for raw materials, last year secured a 51% stake in the Disko-Nuussuaq project on Greenland's west coast, which is operated by London-listed Bluejay Mining (JAY.L). read more

The joint venture will use drones to make a high-resolution magnetic survey of the area and plans to drill a total of 3,000 metres this year to depths of between 150 and 400 metres where the metals are located.

""The objective is to target massive nickel, copper, cobalt and platinum group metals,"" Bluejay Mining Chief Executive Bo Steensgaard told Reuters.

Prices for nickel, used in stainless steel and electric vehicle batteries, more than doubled earlier this month in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which sparked Western sanctions against Moscow. Russia supplies about 10% of the world's nickel needs. read more

""The recent unfortunate geopolitical developments clearly show that the Western world needs new deposits of these critical metals,"" Steensgaard said.

KoBold is a privately-held company whose principal investors include Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a climate and technology fund backed by Microsoft (MSFT.O) co-founder Bill Gates, Bloomberg founder Michael Bloomberg, and Amazon (AMZN.O) founder Jeff Bezos.

""Fully electrifying the global economy is our generation's greatest challenge,"" said KoBold CEO Kurt House.

""To accomplish that lofty goal we must accelerate our efforts to find the key materials for the electric vehicle revolution,"" he said.

Last month, KoBold raised $192.5 million that will be used to discover critical materials.

Other KoBold investors include Silicon Valley venture capital fund Andreessen Horowitz, Norwegian state-controlled energy company Equinor (EQNR.OL), and Ray Dalio, founder of the world's largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates.

FRANKFURT, March 24 (Reuters) - German business software giant SAP (SAPG.DE) on Thursday said it would shut down its cloud operations in Russia, withdrawing further from the country after stopping sales in Russia earlier this month.

""Russia’s ongoing unjustified war is a heartbreaking display of brutality and a violation of the fundamental principle of freedom that we share with Ukraine,"" the company said on its website.

It added that the move would not prevent all customers in Russia from using its products as some organisations run installed software that they may be able to maintain on their own.

The withdrawal marks a change in direction as Chief Executive Christian Klein last week in a newspaper interview defended SAP's decision to still provide services to some industries in Russia such as energy, healthcare and trade that have not been directly affected by sanctions.

The move follows an appeal by Ukraine earlier this month for cloud-computing and software giants including Microsoft (MSFT.O) and SAP to cut off Russia to stop Moscow's invasion.

IDC analyst Philip Carter has said that Russian companies have been largely reluctant to rely completely on cloud services for their information technology, potentially limiting the blow from SAP's move. read more

SAP added on Thursday it was providing its technology to multi-national organizations for humanitarian aid in Ukraine.

Separately, German telecoms group Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) said on Twitter it was closing its activities in Russia, which mainly amount to a software development centre in Saint Petersburg that is now winding down.

27,258,Microsoft,2022-03-24,Suspected Okta hackers arrested by British police,"













LONDON/WASHINGTON, March 24 (Reuters) - Police in Britain have arrested seven people following a series of hacks by the Lapsus$ hacking group which targeted major firms including Okta Inc (OKTA.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), City of London Police said on Thursday.

San Francisco-based Okta Inc, whose authentication services are used by some of the world's biggest companies to provide access to their networks, said on Tuesday it had been hit by hackers and some customers may have been affected. read more

""The City of London Police has been conducting an investigation with its partners into members of a hacking group,"" Detective Inspector Michael O'Sullivan said in an emailed statement in response to a question about the Lapsus$ hacking group.

The ransom-seeking gang had posted a series of screenshots of Okta's internal communications on their Telegram channel late on Monday.

""Seven people between the ages of 16 and 21 have been arrested in connection with this investigation and have all been released under investigation,"" O'Sullivan said.

News of the digital breach had knocked Okta shares down about 11 percent amid criticism of the digital authentication firm's slow response to the intrusion. read more

Shares of Okta were trading down 4.8% on Thursday.

City of London Police did not directly name Lapsus$ in its statement. A spokeswoman said none of the seven people arrested had been formally charged, pending investigation.

WHO ARE LAPSUS$?

Last month, Lapsus$ leaked proprietary information about U.S. chipmaker Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) to the Web. read more

More recently the group has purported to have leaked source code from several big tech firms, including Microsoft, which on Tuesday confirmed that one of its accounts had been compromised.

Lapsus$ have not responded to repeated requests for comment on their Telegram channel and by email.

A teenager living near Oxford, England, is suspected of being behind some of the more notable attacks, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday.

Reached by phone, the father of the teenager - who cannot be named because they are a minor - declined to comment. Reuters confirmed that cybersecurity researchers investigating Lapsus$ believe the teenager was involved in the group, according to three people familiar with the matter.

In a blog post on Thursday, Unit 42, a research team at Palo Alto Networks, described Lapsus$ as an ""attack group"" motivated by notoriety rather than financial gain.

Unlike other groups, they do not rely on the deployment of ransomware - malicious software to encrypt their victims' networks, a hallmark of digital extortionists - and instead manually lay waste to their targets' networks.

Along with Unit 221b, a separate security consultancy, the Palo Alto researchers said they had identified the ""primary actor"" behind Lapsus$ in 2021 and had been ""assisting law enforcement in their efforts to prosecute this group"".

""The teenager we identified as being in control of Lapsus$ is particularly instrumental,"" Allison Nixon, chief research officer at Unit 221b, told Reuters.

""Not just for their leadership role, but for the vital intel they must possess on other members"".

BRUSSELS, March 25 (Reuters) - Tough new rules targeting U.S. tech giants agreed late on Thursday are expected to come into force in October, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Friday.

The rules, which Vestager proposed a year ago, are called the Digital Markets Act and set out a list of dos and don'ts for Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Meta (FB.O), Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google and Microsoft (MSFT.O). read more

Fines for violations range from 10% of a company's annual global turnover to 20% for repeat offenderswhich could face an acquisition ban.

""And with the processes foreseen, these pieces of legislation, well, they will have been voted in and publicised in the Official Journal, so coming into force sometime in October,"" Vestager told a news conference.

Companies that are designated as online gatekeepers which control access to their platforms and the data generated there will have six months to comply with the new rules.

29,272,Microsoft,2022-03-25,Analysis: New EU rules regulating U.S. tech giants likely to set global standard,"













BRUSSELS, March 25 (Reuters) - Landmark EU rules targeting Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Meta (FB.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) are likely to set a global benchmark and may even force changes in the tech giants' business models, lawyers and experts said.

Europe's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager on Thursday won backing from European Union members and EU lawmakers for her proposal, the Digital Markets Act (DMA), to rein in the powers of the tech giants via legislation for the first time, rather than lengthy antitrust investigations. read more

The DMA sets out a list of dos and don'ts targeting each tech giant's core business practices.

""DMA is here to stay and will be quickly mirrored in a number of countries. The flexibility that big tech had will be constrained, as the regulatory 'straitjacket' will get tighter globally,"" said Ioannis Kokkoris, competition law professor at Queen Mary University in London.

Vestager's switch to legislation came amid frustration over slow-moving antitrust investigations that deliver remedies criticised by rivals as inadequate, with Google often cited as an example despite being hit with more than 8 billion euros ($8.8 billion) in fines.

The new rules may even spur tech giants to rethink their strategy on long-term goals and swap their business models for others.

""If it succeeds, the DMA will put pressure on monopoly rents of gatekeepers in tipped markets, thereby encouraging them to move towards more long term innovation targets,"" said Nicolas Petit, professor of competition law at the European University Institute in Florence.

""I think the DMA indirectly places a premium on business models based on subscriptions or device level monetisation. We might see more (increased) prices, and vertical integration into hardware in the future,"" he said.

Still, enforcing the DMA will require a bigger team than the small group planned by the European Commission, said Thomas Vinje, a partner at law firm Clifford Chance in Brussels who has advised rivals in cases against Microsoft, Google and Apple.

""The Commission suggested upon proposing the DMA that it would be enforced by a team of 80 people. This will not be enough to enable effective enforcement,"" he said.

""Another big question is who in the Commission will enforce it. Only DG COMP (competition officials) has the technical and industry knowledge and experience dealing with such companies to effectively enforce the DMA. If others in the Commission, such as DG Connect (digital officials), are to enforce the DMA, it will be a dead letter.""

The DMA is just the first step towards making sure that tech giants play fair, said Alec Burnside, a partner at law firm Dechert in Brussels.

""The DMA is not a perfectly formed panacea from the start, and without doubt gatekeepers will try to navigate around it. Rome was not built in a day, nor was the highway code perfect when first conceived,"" he said.

""New rules of the road for the digital economy will be shaped over the period ahead, and the DMA is a crucially important first step.""

There may be some wiggle room for the tech giants to dodge the full impact of the DMA, said Kokkoris.

""The degree of adverse impact on big tech will depend on the extent they can persuade the Commission of the lack of any anti-competitive effect,"" he.

30,507,Microsoft,2022-03-28,"Deal on rules forcing tech giants to police content possible in April, EU's Vestager says","













BRUSSELS, March 28 (Reuters) - A deal between EU countries and EU lawmakers that would require tech giants to do more to police content on their platforms could be agreed next month, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Monday.

Vestager proposed the Digital Services Act, (DSA) which forces tech giants to do more to tackle illegal content or risk fines up to 6% of their global turnover, just over a year ago.

EU countries and EU lawmakers are now thrashing out the details, with debate over the definition of an online marketplace subject to the rules and the criteria for banning targeted advertisements.

""There is a very strong momentum to get things done. And the leadership of the French presidency may allow us to finalise the Digital Services Act before the end of April. But if we work hard, and we're lucky, it may be possible,"" Vestager told Reuters in an interview.

Vestager last week secured the green light from EU countries and EU lawmakers for her other landmark proposal, called the Digital Markets Act (DMA), targeting Google (GOOGL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Meta (FB.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O). read more

The DMA sets out a list of dos and don'ts and gives companies designated as online gatekeepers, which control access and data on their platforms, six months to comply with the rules. Businesses, however, say that is too short for such complex legislation.

Vestager said there would be no extension as companies are aware of what constitutes anti-competitive practices.

""Well, actually both I think we in our work and the companies should be very happy that we have six months because it was one of the things that were intensively discussed during the negotiations,"" she said.

""And since both the prohibitions and the obligations are things that come from established case law, I don't think any of them are sort of big surprises.""

Asked whether the DMA would cover non-U.S. tech giants, Vestager said: ""It's likely but I don't know.""

Observers said booking.com and Alibaba (9988.HK) may fall under the new rules.

BRUSSELS, March 28 (Reuters) - Cloud computing, in which Amazon (AMZN.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) are the biggest players followed by Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google, doesn't pose competition concerns yet because of Europe's Gaia-X initiative, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Monday.

Cloud computing services have seen demand soar, driven in part by the COVID-19 pandemic.

They have become a big driver of growth at the big tech companies, with AWS generating 13% of Amazon's revenue last year and 74% of its operating income while Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud unit, of which Azure is a big chunk, brought in 37% of its overall sales.

The market power of the big companies has sparked unease at smaller rivals in recent years, with German software provider NextCloud, France's OVHcloud (OVH.PA) and two other companies filing complaints about Microsoft's cloud practices to Vestager. read more

""No, so far we've had no concerns,"" Vestager told Reuters in an interview when asked if she was worried about companies potentially abusing their dominance.

She said Gaia-X, a project to create secure and efficient cloud data that seeks to reduce the EU bloc's dependence on Silicon Valley giants, would boost competition.

""This is not something that we are engaged in, but I basically see it as pro-competitive when you have someone to show potential customers that there are more than two giants where you can place your business,"" she said.

An industry study last year cited respondents worried about unfair terms imposed by some software companies to access their cloud infrastructure, unfair licence terms and bundling of software products with cloud infrastructure services. read more

Microsoft has said that it makes its software available to customers across all environments, including those of other cloud providers.

32,385,Microsoft,2022-03-29,Cooley adds Linklaters' former antitrust head in Brussels,"Summary

Summary Law firms Koponen joins Cooley's antitrust practice as partner in Brussels

He previously led Linklaters' global antitrust practice

He also co-headed Linklaters' healthcare practice















(Reuters) - Silicon Valley-founded law firm Cooley on Tuesday said that the former head of Linklaters’ global competition practice has joined the firm as a partner in its antitrust group in Brussels, home of the European Union's top antitrust regulator.

Jonas Koponen led Linklaters’ global antitrust and foreign investment group from 2015–2019, and previously co-headed the firm’s global healthcare team, according to an archived bio on Linklaters’ website.

Koponen is the third partner to join Cooley’s global antitrust practice in March. The Palo Alto, California-based law firm hired a former DOJ antitrust division attorney in Washington, D.C., and the former co-head of UK law firm CMS’ competition practice in London, Cooley said.

Koponen advises on merger control and enforcement matters, with experience in the finance, healthcare, life sciences and technology sectors, Cooley said in a statement.

According to his Linklaters bio, Koponen has advised Johnson & Johnson on several transactions, including its $16.6 billion acquisition of Pfizer Consumer Healthcare.

He counseled Japanese drugmaker Takeda Pharmaceuticals in 2018 on its $62 billion recommended offer for UK biopharma company Shire – the largest outbound M&A deal by a Japanese company at the time.

Koponen also advised Microsoft on its acquisition of Yahoo's search business, and in relation to a European Commission investigation into Google's alleged antitrust violations in the market for web search services, the bio said.

A spokesperson for Linklaters did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

33,313,Microsoft,2022-03-29,Pentagon delays cloud computing contract to December -official,"













WASHINGTON, March 29 (Reuters) - The Pentagon delayed its decision to award an enterprise-wide Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) contract that could be valued as much as $9 billion to December from April, the Pentagon'schief information officer said on Tuesday.

Proposals are being evaluated from four companies: Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O), Oracle Corp (ORCL.N), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Amazon Web Services , Pentagon Chief Information Officer John Sherman told reporters.

""This is going to take us a little bit longer than we thought,"" Sherman said, adding that the workload to evaluate multiple proposals simultaneously was cumbersome.

Up to four winners could be selected with the combined value of the contracts coming to as much as $9 billion over five years if all options and extensions were exercised, Sherman said.

The JWCC is the multi-cloud successor to the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI), which was an IT modernization project to build a large, common commercial cloud for the Department of Defense. read more

While the Trump administration wanted a single cloud-computing provider for the Department of Defense as laid out under JEDI, the Biden administration canceled it in favor of parceling out the project to multiple companies.

Such a move would put the military more in line with private-sector companies, many of whom split up their cloud computing work among multiple vendors to avoid being locked in to any specific one.

34,234,Microsoft,2022-03-29,Analysis: Sony launches Game Pass counterattack with subscription service upgrade,"Summary

Summary Companies Revamped service will not include new releases -exec

Service includes hits such as ""Spider-Man: Miles Morales""

Gaming margins likely to improve as Sony users upgrade -analyst

Service priced competitively compared to Game Pass -analysts















TOKYO/LOS ANGELES, March 29 (Reuters) - Sony Group Corp's (6758.T) revamp of its PlayStation subscription service is a major step toward levelling the playing field with Microsoft's rival Game Pass, although holding back new releases may dampen enthusiasm, analysts say.

Sony said its expanded PlayStation Plus service will offer hundreds of games, including recent hits such as ""Spider-Man: Miles Morales"", for a flat monthly fee when it launches in the United States, Europe and Japan in June.

The service will not include new releases, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan told Reuters, but users can still find big-budget titles such as ""Returnal"" and ""God of War"".

""There will be more from PlayStation Studios, and all of the major publishers will be represented,"" Ryan said.

Sony is widely seen as leading in the console war, selling 17 million PlayStation 5 (PS5) units even as chip shortages hit production, but has been under pressure to respond to the growth of Netflix-style game subscription services.

The revamped Sony service combines the current PlayStation Plus, which has 48 million subscribers and offers online gaming and only a few free games each month, with PlayStation Now, which has 3.2 million users and a library of games to download and stream.

There are three tiers, priced at $9.99 to $17.99 monthly or $59.99 to $119.99 annually. The lowest-price tier, PlayStation Plus Essential, looks like Sony's current offering.

PlayStation Plus Extra adds a catalogue of PS4 and PS5 games. PlayStation Plus Premium offers a further library of older titles, cloud streaming in major markets and time-limited game trials.

Such streamlining is ""overdue"", said Lewis Ward, head of gaming research at IDC.

""The number of PlayStation subscribers in the higher two tiers... will tick up over time, which is undoubtedly a core reason for this change,"" Ward said.

Given the high cost of developing new games, analysts had raised concerns that pressure to bundle more content with subscriptions may eat into profit at Sony's coveted games unit.

Sony will seek to preserve new game sales alongside the subscription service.

""I think this move should improve margins, as more gamers will be driven to higher-cost subscriptions,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at Ampere Analysis.

""If content acquisition costs do increase, Sony will need to balance that with the additional revenue it will be generating from the PS Plus subscriber base,"" he added.

HIGH STAKES GAME

Microsoft is aggressively growing Game Pass, which has 25 million subscribers, by adding new titles on their launch day while buying studios to expand its offerings.

In January, the Redmond, Washington-based firm struck a $68.7 billion deal for ""Call of Duty"" publisher Activision Blizzard.

Sony, which has built its own in-house studio network, responded by buying ""Destiny"" publisher Bungie for $3.6 billion, with many analysts expecting further dealmaking. read more

Microsoft has gained an early lead in subscriptions, accounting for 60% of the games subscriptions in North America and Europe, compared with 7% for Sony, according to Ampere Analysis. Subscriptions make up only 4% of total gaming spending.

""PlayStation believes it is smarter for them and for third-party publishers to put older games into the subscription plan so that new games can maximize their revenue potential during their launch windows,"" said IDC's Ward.

That hesitance means Sony's offering ""won't have the pull of Microsoft's service,"" added Ampere's Harding-Rolls.

Sony's newly announced pricing is seen as competitive. The premium tier's $120 annual fee compares with $180 for Game Pass Ultimate. Both offer cloud gaming, with Sony users able to stream titles to their consoles and PC.

Cloud gaming is seen as the future for the industry, because it doesn't require downloading or installing games on a console or PC. That is a potential threat to the console business, whose operators that have acted as industry gatekeepers.

An annual subscription to the mid-tier PlayStation Plus Extra, which lacks this cloud-gaming feature, works out at just over $8 monthly, compared with $9.99 for the Game Pass.

""Value and pricing of that nature would simply not be possible if we were to put our new games into the service upon their release,"" said Sony's Ryan.

Microsoft has said that Game Pass subscribers play more games and spend more on games, too - a view echoed by Sony.

""Everything comes down to engagement,"" Ryan said. ""If you get people engaged on your platform, monetization typically follows.""

Summary

Summary Companies Exclusive: U.S. probe of Google Maps picks up speed - sources















WASHINGTON, March 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has breathed new life into an investigation of Google Maps to determine if bundling the service together with other Google software illegally stifles competition, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

The probe of the Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) unit first came to light in late 2020 and had been quiet until recent months when investigators again began making inquiries, the sources said.

Google said it cooperates with regulators and welcomes their questions. The Justice Department declined comment.

The probe has two components.

One part focuses on apps, including for navigation, that are provided through infotainment screens in vehicles. In its Google Automotive Services package for automakers, the search company bundles together Maps, the Google Play app store, Google Assistant and other services. Car companies are prevented from, for example, mixing Google Maps with voice assistants developed by smaller rivals, one source said.

In response, Google said the integration provides the best user experience, and that in some instances a rival voice assistant can function with Google Maps.

The other component focuses on app and website developers. Specifically, the department is looking at Google's requirement that if a website or app uses one Google technology, say Google's location search, the website or app developer cannot use maps or other technologies developed by Google’s rivals, the two sources said.

A congressional antitrust panel concluded in a Big Tech staff report issued in 2020 that Google ""enforces this provision aggressively"" and effectively forces developers ""to choose whether they will use all of Google's mapping services or none of them.""

Google said its policies are aimed at preventing poor experiences, noting that mixing a Google Map with information on another map could lead to errors. The policies also stem from restrictions that partners place on how Google can use their data, it said.

The policies have some exceptions, and Google added that developers ""are also free to use other mapping services in addition to Google Maps Platform – and many do.""

MONEY AND DATA AT STAKE

Two developers have told Reuters over the past year that they received violation notices from Google in recent years after mixing data from the company's services with maps from other providers. The developers said the competing options were less expensive or more detailed than Google Maps in some cases.

The developers, speaking on the condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation by Google, also have expressed concern about the company's new privacy options for users of its Android mobile operating system that could limit data collection by rival mapping providers.

At stake are money and data, including about places and people's interests. Google does not separately disclose sales from licensing the map-related tools. But Google over the years has hiked mapping fees and tied the business to its Cloud unit, whose sales growth is of keen interest to investors.

In addition, the enduring use of Google's mapping services enables the company to collect more data to maintain its dominance over competing options.

Tying products together is not always illegal but antitrust enforcers have stepped in when such bundling does not benefit consumers.

In 1998, the government sued Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) for allegedly breaking antitrust law by tying its operating system monopoly to Internet Explorer to crush rival browser Netscape.

There is no sign that the department's staff investigating Google Maps have recommended whether to sue, one of the sources said.

Google already is fighting a lawsuit the department filed in 2020, accusing it of breaking antitrust law to maintain its dominance of search and search advertising. It goes to trial in 2023.

A lawsuit against Google over its dominance of the online advertising business has long been expected to follow. read more That probe is further along than the one into the maps business, one source said.

The antitrust enforcer could be hampered in wrapping up the long-running probes because it has been swamped by an unusually large number of merger reviews and merger-related trials. A merger trial is expected in April and two more are expected in August.

36,194,Microsoft,2022-03-30,'Back from vacation' - Lapsus$ hackers claim breach of Globant,"













March 30 (Reuters) - The Lapsus$ gang of hackers claimed late Tuesday that it broke into software services firm Globant SA and stole 70 gigabytes of source code from the company's customers.

Globant confirmed a breach on Wednesday, saying that some of its code was accessed without authorization. The company said in a filing that it found no evidence that other areas of its infrastructure - or those of its clients - were affected. The company did not name Lapsus$ or identify who was responsible for the breach.

News of the hack sent Globant's shares tumbling about 10% to $248.92.

On its Telegram channel, Lapsus$ posted a screenshot of more than two dozen folders containing what it said was customer source code, including from well-known tech companies. The authenticity of the screenshot could not immediately be ascertained, but the group has previously stolen source code or other proprietary data from tech heavyweights including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O).

Recently, the group claimed credit for having breached OktaInc(OKTA.O)after breaking into one of its contractors.

Lapsus$ has stunned and baffled cybersecurity experts in equal measure with its combination of juvenile antics and high-level access to some of the biggest companies in the world. The group uses a variety of methods, including bluffing, trickery, and bribes to steal passwords, Microsoft said in a blog post last week.

Following news of the Okta breach, British authorities announced that seven people - aged 16 to 21 - had been arrested at some unspecified point in the past and then later released. The authorities gave few other details but it was around that time that Lapsus$ told its fans ""a few of our members"" were going on holiday. read more

Neither the break - nor the arrests - appear to have curbed the group's appetite for leaks.

""We are officially back from a vacation,"" the group said as it announced the Globant breach.

OAKLAND, Calif., March 30 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) President Brad Smith wrote to Ukraine's leader this month with a clear message: despite Kyiv's calls for it to sever all ties with Russia, the U.S. software behemoth would continue doing business in the country with non-sanctioned clients, including schools and hospitals.

""Depriving these institutions of software updates and services could put at risk the health and safety of innocent civilians, including children and the elderly,"" Smith said in the previously unreported March 14 letter, seen by Reuters.

Smith told President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that Microsoft was ""mindful of the moral responsibility"" to protect civilians. However, he said the company was discussing with U.S., British and EU governments whether ""to halt any ongoing services and support"" in Russia and would move ""in lockstep with their sanctions and other economic goals.""

Asked about the exchange, spokespeople for both Microsoft and Ukraine said a constructive dialogue was underway about actions to support the country.

The decision by some leading Western business technology makers - including Microsoft, German software multinational SAP SE (SAPG.DE) and U.S. giant International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) - to maintain operations or staff in Russia despite Ukraine's appeals have angered their workers in several countries.

Small groups of employees at Microsoft, SAP and IBM have called for management to withdraw fully from Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine, according to comments seen by Reuters on internal discussion forums and interviews with 18 workers familiar with the companies, who sought anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The employees – echoing Ukrainian officials – have urged the companies to go beyond ending new sales and dropping sanctioned clients in order to increase economic pressure on Moscow. They want their companies to suspend every deal in Russia, including for software clients may use to track sales, supply chains and workforces.

Asked about the internal criticism, IBM said it has ceased working with Russian companies anywhere in the world - though it has stopped short of layoffs or suspending support of foreign businesses in Russia.

SAP told Reuters it was complying with government actions and even going beyond them, and it would ""welcome new sanctions currently under discussion.""

SAP responded to Ukraine's requests to cut all ties in Russia with a previously undisclosed letter this month to President Zelenskiy – reviewed in part by Reuters – saying that it was supporting essential Russian services, including ""hospitals, civilian infrastructure and food supply chains.""

The three companies have not ruled out further pullback. But for now, their employees in Russia are getting paid and accessing workplace tools, colleagues said. Local phone numbers are active for all three, Reuters found.

Questioned about the demands on Western tech businesses from their own workers and the Ukrainian government to quit Russia, a Kremlin spokesperson said that ""some companies are leaving, others are staying. New ones will come in their place.""

The spokesperson noted that companies had legal obligations to employees that must be fulfilled, such as paying wages.

Russian prosecutors have warned some Western businesses that their staff could face arrests if production of essential goods was stopped, according to media reports. read more The Wall Street Journal named IBM among those warned.

The Kremlin spokesperson denied the reports about pressure on companies from prosecutors: ""The part about arrests is a lie.""

UKRAINIAN LOBBYING

Ukraine Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, one of the leading campaigners for a digital blockade, said Russia was already feeling the impact as some technology companies exit, such as developers of digital payment and web development tools. But he is pushing for a complete departure.

""We will keep trying until those companies have made the decision to leave Russia,"" he said.

Fedorov's team told Reuters last week that a ""huge number"" of Russian organizations have contracts for SAP's software, including major banking and energy companies. Reuters could not independently confirm SAP's customers in Russia, and SAP said it was in full compliance with sanctions.

Russia's Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media did not answer requests for comment on the impact of departures by Western technology companies, nor the extent of SAP's footprint in the country.

Mirroring the Ukrainian government's message, SAP's five salespeople for Ukraine told regional managers on a call March 18 that the company must end support for remaining Russian clients, according to a person familiar with the discussion.

Fedorov said on Friday in a tweet, citing a conversation with SAP Chief Executive Christian Klein, that the company would ""gradually stop supporting"" products in Russia. A day earlier, SAP had said it was shutting its Russian cloud business, which two sources described as a small operation.

In a March 23 letter sent to customers in Russia, reviewed by Reuters, SAP asked cloud clients to advise whether their data in the Russian cloud should be deleted, handed back to them or moved outside the country.

SAP confirmed the content of the letter, and said that Fedorov and Klein spoke. It declined to comment further.

At IBM, hundreds of workers criticized the company's response to Russia's invasion, three people with knowledge of internal messages said.

CEO Arvind Krishna on a March 2 call with employees had taken no sides on the war, one of the sources said. In a now-public message to workers the previous day, IBM had referred to what it described as the ""deteriorating situation involving Ukraine and Russia.""

One comment on an internal discussion forum, seen by Reuters, called on the CEO to read a book on IBM's work during the Holocaust describing how the company designed punch-card machines that Nazi Germany used to track Jewish people: ""Think carefully and do the right thing - pull IBM and IBMer's in Russia out of Russia,"" the employee wrote.

IBM declined to comment on the remark.

Responding to the outcry, Krishna announced in a March 3 post a suspension of sales in Russia and condemned ""the Russian war in Ukraine."" On March 7, he went further, saying that IBM had suspended ""all business"" in Russia – without elaborating.

An IBM spokesperson told Reuters March 24 that the business suspension meant the company is no longer providing ""goods, parts, software, services, consulting and technology"" anywhere in the world to Russian clients.

Several Microsoft workers on internal chat tools have also demanded the company exit Russia altogether, with some even telling senior management they would quit otherwise, an employee said. Microsoft declined to comment.

DOUBTS

Some workers told Reuters they have not joined the calls for full exits due to doubts over harming civilians and how strong an impact the companies' withdrawal from Russia would have.

For instance, the United States on Feb. 24 sanctioned Russian Railways, a state-owned company operating passenger and freight trains. IBM that day placed the company on its “Denied Parties List” and stopped tech support, according to an IBM letter to Ukrainian minister Fedorov dated March 5, seen by Reuters.

Denied parties cannot access official replacement discs, adapters and memory for mainframes that a former IBM salesperson said need swapping every two years.

But a person familiar with operations at Russian Railways said it can run for years without aid.

Russian Railways did not respond to requests for comment. IBM declined to comment.

SAP also told Reuters that because some clients have its software installed on their machines they can keep using it regardless of the company's decision not to provide support.

39,460,Microsoft,2022-03-30,"Amazon gets rare 'underperform' rating on risks from higher expenses, inflation","













March 30 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) received a rare ""underperform"" rating from BNP Paribas Exane on Wednesday, with the French brokerage saying the e-commerce giant faces a bumpy ride ahead due to surging inflation and higher expenses.

Analyst Stefan Slowinski said investments during the COVID-19 pandemic to build fulfillment centers for faster deliveries and employee bonuses to keep its warehouses staffed in a tight U.S. labor market may eat into the company's margins.

He added that capital expenditure could grow in the mid-teens, initiating with a price target of $2,800.

Amazon's shares were down about 1% at $3,354 in early trading in a weak broader market.

Of the 58 brokerages covering Amazon, 20 rate the stock ""strong buy"", 36 ""buy"", one ""hold"" and one ""sell"", according to Refinitiv data. The median price target is $4,000.

Amazon boomed during the pandemic as consumers were highly dependent on online shopping for everyday essentials, but those shoppers are now returning to stores.

Customers are also cutting back on discretionary spending in a highly inflationary environment, at a time when costs of raw materials, procurement and shipping are rising for companies.

""While margin expansion is possible, clearly with high inflation the consumer is under pressure... Amazon is already increasing prices on their customers by increasing their Prime pricing,"" Slowinski said.

He added that Amazon would not raise pricing on many products to match inflation and would probably take a hit.

The company would need to allocate capital expenditure for its cloud business, as it aims to expand footprint by about 30% in a competitive market, he said.

The stock is up 1.6% as of Tuesday's close, after tumbling as much as 20% during the selloff earlier this year.

Peers in the $1 trillion and larger club, Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O), have declined 6% and 1.6% ,respectively. Apple has gained 0.8% and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) has added 4%.

BRUSSELS, March 31 (Reuters) - Regulators are looking to update rules, which target companies abusing their market power and those setting up illegal cartels, to make them more efficient, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Thursday.

Under the rules, known as Regulation 1/2003 and in force since 2004, the European Commission has taken on Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta (FB.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Intel (INTC.O) and imposed billions of euros in fines.

The rules have also allowed the EU competition enforcer to go after car parts cartels, banks' manipulation of financial benchmarks and other illegal price-fixing groups, putting the EU agency in the forefront of antitrust enforcement.

The Commission wants to maintain its leading position, Vestager said.

""I'm announcing today that in the coming months we are going to launch an evaluation of Regulation 1/2003, the central plank of our antitrust enforcement framework,"" Vestager told a conference organised by economic consultancy CRA.

""It is important that we hear the views of stakeholders concerning what has worked well, and where there is scope for more efficient and effective procedures and enforcement tools; making sure Regulation 1 is truly 'fit for the digital age',"" she said.

Vestager said the updated rules would seek to make them more operational and useful to businesses.

Such procedural changes would relate to requests for information sent to companies, dawn raids, oral hearings where companies seek to defend their cases and the 10% cap on fines levied for breach of rules or non-compliance.

41,351,Microsoft,2022-03-31,EXCLUSIVE U.S. warned firms about Russia's Kaspersky software day after invasion -sources,"Summary

Summary Companies U.S. government privately briefed American companies on software

Kaspersky says briefings unjust and damages its reputation















March 31 (Reuters) - The U.S. government began privately warning some American companies the day after Russia invaded Ukraine that Moscow could manipulate software designed by Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky to cause harm, according to a senior U.S. official and two people familiar with the matter.

The classified briefings are part of Washington's broader strategy to prepare providers of critical infrastructure such as water, telecoms and energy for potential Russian intrusions.

President Joe Biden said last week that sanctions imposed on Russia for its Feb. 24 attack on Ukraine could result in a backlash, including cyber disruptions, but the White House did not offer specifics.

""The risk calculation has changed with the Ukraine conflict,"" said the senior U.S. official about Kaspersky's software. ""It has increased.""

Kaspersky, one of the cybersecurity industry's most popular anti-virus software makers, is headquartered in Moscow and was founded by Eugene Kaspersky, who U.S. officials describe as a former Russian intelligence officer.

A Kaspersky spokeswoman said in a statement that the briefings about purported risks of Kaspersky software would be ""further damaging"" to Kaspersky’s reputation ""without giving the company the opportunity to respond directly to such concerns"" and that it ""is not appropriate or just.""

The senior U.S. official said Kaspersky's Russia-based staff could be coerced into providing or helping establish remote access into their customers' computers by Russian law enforcement or intelligence agencies.

Eugene Kaspersky, according to his company website, graduated from the Institute of Cryptography, Telecommunications and Computer Science, which the Soviet KGB previously administered. The company spokeswoman said that Kaspersky worked as a ""software engineer"" during military service.

The Russian cybersecurity firm, which has an office in the United States, lists partnerships with Microsoft, Intel and IBM on its website. Microsoft declined to comment. Intel and IBM did not respond to requests for comment.

On March 25, the Federal Communications Commission added Kaspersky to its list of communications equipment and service providers deemed threats to U.S. national security. read more

It is not the first time Washington has said Kaspersky could be influenced by the Kremlin.

The Trump administration spent months banning Kaspersky from government systems and warning numerous companies to not use the software in 2017 and 2018.

U.S. security agencies conducted a series of similar cybersecurity briefings surrounding the Trump ban. The content of those meetings four years ago was comparable to the new briefings, said one of the people familiar with the matter.

Over the years, Kaspersky has consistently denied wrongdoing or any secret partnership with Russian intelligence.

It is unclear whether a specific incident or piece of new intelligence led to the security briefings. The senior official declined to comment on classified information.

Until now no U.S. or allied intelligence agency has ever offered direct, public proof of a backdoor in Kaspersky software.

Following the Trump decision, Kaspersky opened a series of transparency centers, where it says partners can review its code to check for malicious activity. A company blog post at the time explained the goal was to build trust with customers after the U.S. accusations.

But the U.S. official said the transparency centers are not ""even a fig leaf"" because they do not address the U.S. government's concern.

""Moscow software engineers handle the [software] updates, that's where the risk comes,"" they said. ""They can send malicious commands through the updaters and that comes from Russia.""

Cybersecurity experts say that because of how anti-virus software normally functions on computers where it is installed, it requires a deep level of control to discovery malware. This makes anti-virus software an inherently advantageous channel to conduct espionage.

In addition, Kaspersky's products are also sometimes sold under white label sales agreements. This means the software can be packaged and renamed in commercial deals by information technology contractors, making their origin difficult to immediately determine.

While not referring to Kaspersky by name, Britain's cybersecurity center on Tuesday said organizations providing services related to Ukraine or critical infrastructure should reconsider the risk associated with using Russian computer technology in their supply chains.

""We have no evidence that the Russian state intends to suborn Russian commercial products and services to cause damage to UK interests, but the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence,"" the National Cyber Security Centre said in a blog post.

42,299,Microsoft,2022-03-31,"BlackBerry misses Q4 revenue estimates, cybersecurity unit growth flat","













March 31 (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd (BB.TO) reported fourth-quarter revenue on Thursday that missed analysts' estimates as growth at its cybersecurity business, its biggest, was flat due to increased competition.

U.S.-listed shares of the Canadian security-software provider and former mobile phone-maker dropped 5% in extended trading.

BlackBerry has been losing ground to larger competitors like Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and IBM (IBM.N) for cybersecurity solutions, while sales are further stressed by a slowdown in automotive production due to components shortage.

Chief Executive Officer John Chen on a conference call said the slowdown in automobile sector, a major customer segment for its Internet of Things (IoT) unit, is expected to persist.

""Although they (automobile makers) expected the situation to largely improve as the year progresses.""

During the reported quarter, performance in cybersecurity was partially offset by higher sales and margin improvements in the IoT unit, which helped nudge BlackBerry's bottomline into the green territory.

The company's net income for the quarter ended Feb. 28 stood at $144 million. It posted a net loss of $315 million a year ago.

Excluding items, the company earned earned 1 cent per share, compared with analysts' estimate of a loss of 4 cents per share.

Revenue fell to $185 million from $210 million a year earlier. Analysts, on average, were expecting $186.8 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration















LONDON, April 1 (Reuters) - The City of London police, which has been investigating the Lapsus$ hacking group, said on Friday it had charged two teenagers with cyber offences.

A 16-year-old and 17-year-old were charged with unauthorised access to a computer with intent to impair the reliability of data, fraud by false representation and unauthorised access to a computer with intent to hinder access to data, police said.

The 16-year-old was also charged with one count of causing a computer to perform a function to secure unauthorised access to a programme, Detective Inspector Michael O'Sullivan said.

Relative newcomers to the crowded digital extortion market, Lapsus$ has stunned and baffled cybersecurity experts in equal measure with its combination of juvenile antics and high-level access to some of the biggest companies in the world.

The hacking group has targeted firms including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Okta Inc (OKTA.O), an authentication services company relied on by thousands of major businesses.

A spokesperson for the City of London police declined to confirm or deny that the teenagers were charged in connection with the Lapsus$ investigation.

British police do not generally name suspects.

The force said in March it had arrested seven people aged between 16 and 21 following a series of hacks by Lapsus$. read more

44,142,Microsoft,2022-04-01,Microsoft's cloud business targeted by EU antitrust regulators,"













BRUSSELS, April 1 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are quizzing Microsoft's (MSFT.O) rivals and customers about its cloud business and licensing deals, a questionnaire seen by Reuters showed, in a move that could lead to a formal investigation and renewed scrutiny of the U.S. software company.

The European Commission has fined Microsoft a total 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in the previous decade for breaching EU antitrust rules and for not complying with its order to halt anti-competitive practices.

The company found itself on the EU competition enforcer's radar again after German software provider NextCloud, France's OVHcloud (OVH.PA) and two other companies filed complaints about Microsoft's cloud practices.

""The Commission has information that Microsoft may be using its potentially dominant position in certain software markets to foreclose competition regarding certain cloud computing services,"" the questionnaire said.

Regulators asked if the terms in Microsoft's licensing deals with cloud service providers allow rivals to compete effectively.

They also want to know if companies needed Microsoft's operating systems and productivity applications to complement their own cloud infrastructure offering in order to compete effectively.

Companies also were asked about the differences in license fees and commercial terms between the licensing deals with cloud service providers and another programme in which they package and indirectly resell Microsoft's cloud services together with their own.

Another focus was potential technical limitations on cloud storage services available on companies' cloud infrastructure.

""We're continuously evaluating how we can best support partners and make Microsoft software available to customers across all environments, including those of other cloud providers,"" Microsoft said in an emailed statement.

EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager earlier this week said she has no concerns yet about cloud computing and cited the competition from Europe's Gaia-X initiative. read more

NEW YORK, April 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) may be getting more than it bargained for in its $69 billion deal to buy Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O). Shares of the “Call of Duty” game publisher are trading more than 15% below the software giant’s cash offer of $95 per share - a bigger gap than is typical for such deals. That suggests investors foresee possible trouble ahead.

Activision was already in hot water when Microsoft boss Satya Nadella came knocking read more in January. The company recently settled allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. But there's more to come. The Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating an Activision options trade made by media moguls David Geffen and Barry Diller days before Microsoft's acquisition was announced, according to the Wall Street Journal. And some U.S. senators want the merger investigated on anticompetitive grounds.

Microsoft's $2.3 trillion market value dwarfs the deal size. But it's bringing outsized scrutiny of a kind the Redmond, Washington giant has avoided in the past and may not relish now. (By Jennifer Saba)

46,359,Microsoft,2022-04-04,U.S. truck drivers go missing,"













WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters Breakingviews) - It should be boom time for employment in the trucking industry. Washington is cutting red tape while employers are offering $15,000 bonuses to address driver shortages and mitigate supply-chain disruptions. But drivers are still scarce.

An aging workforce is partly to blame. The American Trucking Associations last October estimated the industry is short of 80,000 drivers. Employers have responded by boosting weekly pay, in some cases to more than five times the historical average. The White House is also doing its part. President Joe Biden on Monday is highlighting policy changes that expand apprenticeships, make it easier to get commercial driver licenses, and more.

Yet while most sectors gained workers from February to March, trucking lost almost 5,000 of them according to the Labor Department, one of the largest sector declines. Long-haul trucking faces the toughest road because of time spent away from home. And some hoped-for solutions, like self-driving trucks, remain far off. It will be a while before all the needed big rigs are back on the road.

47,326,Microsoft,2022-04-04,AMD to buy cloud startup Pensando for $1.9 billion in data center push,"













April 4 (Reuters) - Chip designer Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) said on Monday it would acquire cloud startup Pensando for $1.9 billion to bolster its data center products and capitalize on booming demand from cloud and enterprise sectors.

AMD said the deal value does not include working capital and other adjustments.

Pensando, which was founded in 2017 by a group of four ex-Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) engineers, counts Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) cloud unit Azure as its customers.

The startup makes a fully programmable processor and a software platform, which helps enterprise clients and data center customers to function more like cloud computing data centers like Amazon's (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services.

In cloud computing, customers can order as much computing power as needed in different parts of the world with a few mouse clicks. The software takes care of the mechanics of shuffling the data to the right physical machines.

The lucrative data center chip business is rife with competition, with AMD rivals Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Nvidia Corp

Only last month, Nvidia had released a new chip to speed up artificial intelligence functions in data centers. read more

The deal, which would enable AMD to add Pensando's platform to its line of processors and graphics chips, is expected to close in the second quarter of this year.

Pensando's Chief Executive Officer Prem Jain and the entire team will join AMD's Data Center Solutions Group.

LONDON, April 4 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Premier Inn owner Whitbread (WTB.L) is looking for a new leader, The Sunday Times reported. In her seven years in charge, outgoing Chief Executive Alison Brittain dealt with at least two activist attacks, a shareholder revolt over bonuses, and the pandemic, which stopped travel and forced her to cut jobs. Her successor will catch the end of the post-pandemic rebound in travel and eating out, especially in Germany where lockdowns eased later. Whitbread has around 30 hotels in Europe’s biggest economy. Hotel stays by workers on big infrastructure projects will also help.

Beyond that, the new boss will have to battle rising costs, supply constraints and labour shortages. But international expansion and promotion of premium services can keep revenues growing while protecting margins. Compared to navigating lockdowns, it’s a simple task. (By Dasha Afanasieva)

April 4 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes rose on Monday, boosted by megacap tech and growth stocks and a surge in Twitter after Elon Musk revealed his stake in the company, amid cautionary signals in the bond market and talk of more sanctions against Russia over Ukraine.

Gains were relatively concentrated as the financial sector (.SPSY) fell, as did defensive groups such as utilities (.SPLRCU) and healthcare (.SPXHC).

In the bond market, the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield ticked up on Monday and the 2-year/10-year yield curve remained inverted. The curve inversion is seen as a harbinger of a recession in the next two years or so.

""All this talk about an inverted yield curve and what that may be predicting in terms of possible economic slowdown, that puts a premium on growth stocks again,"" said Chuck Carlson, CEO of Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.

Stocks have rebounded in recent weeks after a rocky start to the year amid concerns about the Federal Reserve tightening monetary policy to fight inflation and the war in Ukraine. The S&P 500 is down about 4% so far in 2022, after being down as much as 12.5%.

Investors remained concerned about the Ukraine crisis, which has led to a spike in commodity prices that has worsened the outlook for already high inflation.

Summary Law firms Alden Millard will succeed Bill Dougherty as chair of law firm's executive committee

Revenue and profits rose under Dougherty's leadership















(Reuters) - Simpson Thacher & Bartlett on Monday said it has elected Alden Millard, a corporate partner who has practiced at the New York-based law firm since 1996, as its next leader.

Millard will succeed William Dougherty, who has served as chair of Simpson Thacher's governing executive committee for nearly a decade. Dougherty remains at the firm as a partner, according to its website.

Millard, who is based in New York, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his new role.

Under Dougherty's tenure as chair, Simpson Thacher has seen its fortunes rise along with other leading U.S. law firms. From when he assumed leadership in 2013 through 2021, its revenue increased to $2.2 billion from $1.1 billion, while average equity partner profits ballooned to about $6 million and attorney head count grew to more than 1,100 lawyers, according to data collected by ALM Media.

Simpson Thacher was among the U.S. law firms that thrived during last year's global boom in M&A work, when total M&A activity reached more than $5.9 trillion, according to year-end data from Refinitiv. Simpson Thacher ranked fifth among U.S. law firms last year by combined deal value, advising on more than $509 billion in transaction.

In the first quarter of 2022, Simpson Thacher advised on 53 global announced deals worth $144.9 billion, second only to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Both firms have roles on Microsoft Corp's $68.7 billion acquisition of ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard Inc.

Millard's clients include private equity firms Blackstone Inc and First Reserve Corp. He represented Blackstone in its $5 billion acquisition of the Chamberlain Group LLC, which owns garage door company LiftMaster, from the Duchossois Group Inc in September.

He also represented Blackstone when it purchased a majority stake in Thomson Reuters' Financial & Risk unit in 2018. Thomson Reuters is the parent company of Reuters News.

Summary Law firms Mayer Brown hires partner Dominique Shelton Leipzig in Los Angeles

She advises clients on data, advertising technology privacy, Internet of Things















(Reuters) - Privacy and cybersecurity lawyer Dominique Shelton Leipzig, who has advised technology giants Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp and Meta Platforms Inc, is taking her practice from Perkins Coie to Mayer Brown, the Chicago-founded law firm said on Monday.

Shelton Leipzig joins as a Los Angeles-based partner, where she will lead teams focused on global data innovation and advertising technology privacy and data management, as she did at Perkins Coie.

Shelton Leipzig said those will be teams within the firm's cybersecurity and data privacy practice, which is led by former U.S. National Security Agency general counsel Raj De.

""What drove the move [to Mayer Brown] is really the inflection point where we are with data right now, with it driving really everything that we do,"" including education, work, financial services and healthcare, she said.

Clients need help navigating the ever-growing amount of data, connected devices and points of possible attack, she said. Companies want to leverage data to be competitive and are also grappling with a ""minefield"" of data protection and security laws globally.

Those factors have also driven many other large law firms to bulk up their privacy and data security practice groups in recent years with both new partners and associates. In 2020 and into 2021, data privacy practice leaders swapped firms at a fast clip.

Shelton Leipzig also cited Mayer Brown's growth in Northern California, where she has technology clients, as a draw.

She advises clients on privacy and cybersecurity compliance, defends companies in government and regulatory investigations and conducts trainings for corporate boards, the firm said.

Shelton Leipzig also represented the California Chamber of Commerce in a negotiation with California privacy law architect Alastair Mactaggart and others on the California Privacy Rights Act, the firm said.

A Perkins Coie spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on her departure.

HONG KONG, April 4 (Reuters Breakingviews) - China’s BYD (002594.SZ), (1211.HK) on Friday said it has stopped making vehicles powered only by internal combustion engines. But it’s not sending gas-guzzling motors to the scrap heap yet: sales of its hybrid cars are revving up, growing 857% to 141,514 in the first quarter compared with the same period last year. That means hybrids accounted for nearly half of BYD’s passenger vehicle sales in the period.

Automakers including Toyota (7203.T) read more have found the transition technology a lucrative niche. BYD’s Qin and Song models are an easier sell for customers who can’t or won’t go all-electric. Their popularity helped the Warren Buffett-backed brand be the world’s best-selling maker of new energy vehicles – a term that covers hybrids as well as pure electric cars – in the first two months of 2022, per Bernstein, with 16% of market share, versus Tesla’s (TSLA.O) 13%.

However, policymakers in Beijing back battery power to cut carbon dioxide, and hybrids bloat BYD’s average new energy vehicle emissions. Even Li Auto (2015.HK) – the $27 billion Chinese brand built on hybrids – plans to launch all-electric models soon. BYD’s joyride may not last. (By Katrina Hamlin)

The 23 billion pound lender’s interest comes hot on the heels of Royal Bank of Canada’s (RY.TO) 1.6 billion pound swoop on Brewin Dolphin (BRW.L), and less than a year after JPMorgan (JPM.N) scooped up Nutmeg, a so-called robo-adviser. The appeal is obvious: banks want fast-growing, fee-based businesses to garner higher valuation multiples. And wealth managers face increasing investment requirements as services move online. Large lenders, stuffed with excess capital from the pandemic, can help meet those costs.

But they’ll have to pay up. RBC paid the equivalent of 2.8% of Brewin’s assets under management, and a whopping 60% above the undisturbed equity value. Tilney’s reported 2.5 billion pound to 3 billion pound valuation would be an even chunkier 4% to 5% of its managed assets. The fund industry’s digital transformation means companies have plenty of room to grow. But so do M&A prices. (By Liam Proud)

54,378,Microsoft,2022-04-04,China's fashion star has $100 bln yarn to spin,"













HONG KONG, April 4 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Chinese fast-fashion phenom Shein can grow into its $100 billion valuation. The secretive e-commerce company is planning to raise $1 billion in funding that could value it at more than Zara-owner Inditex (ITX.MC) and Swedish rival H&M (HMb.ST) combined, per Bloomberg. That needn't be a stretch.

Thanks to its U.S. import-tax exemptions, founder Chris Xu's online-marketing and data background, and proximity to Chinese garment factories, the digital-only retailer overtook Amazon (AMZN.O) as the top U.S. shopping app last year. A dress on Shein retails for 30% less than on Zara, reckons Euromonitor.

Shein was last valued at $50 billion in early 2021; that same year, revenue surged 57% to $15.7 billion, Reuters reported read more . Assuming it can keep up the same pace this year, then the 12-digit price tag implies an enterprise value of 4 times sales. That's above Uniqlo's Japanese owner, Fast Retailing (9983.T), which trades on just 2.5 times. But the latter's top line is expected to increase roughly 6% in the fiscal year to August, per Refinitiv forecasts. Shein’s sizable premium hangs on convincing investors of its growth prospects.

55,364,Microsoft,2022-04-04,"Skadden, Goodwin led M&A pack in Q1 as dealmaking cooled","Summary

Summary Law firms First-quarter global deals fell to $1 trillion, down 23%

Skadden was top global adviser by transaction value

Goodwin handled the greatest number of deals















Law firms Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom and Goodwin Procter emerged as top deal advisers in the first quarter of 2022, even as global dealmaking took a tumble.

With Russia's invasion of Ukraine helping fuel market volatility, the combined value of global deals fell to $1 trillion from $1.3 trillion in the first quarter of 2021, a 23% year-over-year drop, according to data from Refinitiv.

Skadden advised on 49 deals worth more than $145.6 billion in the past quarter, including transactions for DuPont de Nemours Inc and Spotify Inc, placing the New York-based firm atop Refinitiv's league tables by deal value.

The firm is guiding ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard Inc in its $68.7 billion acquisition by Xbox maker Microsoft Corp. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, which is advising Microsoft in that same deal, is ranked second by deal value, having worked on 53 announced deals worth $144.9 billion, according to Refinitiv.

New York-based Sullivan & Cromwell advised on $662.5 billion in deals last year, the most of any firm. In the first quarter, it was ranked sixth overall, with $93.3 billion in global deals.

Goodwin Procter was the top firm by the number of global M&A transactions it shepherded last quarter, having advised on 294 announced deals worth $51.8 billion. The Boston-founded firm was also the top-ranking law firm by deal volume in 2021, working on 1,083 deals.

Goodwin's work this past quarter included representing software maker Citrix Systems Inc in its $16.5 billion acquisition by affiliates of Elliott Investment Management LP and Vista Equity Partners.

Kirkland & Ellis, which is advising Vista in that transaction, worked on 207 announced deals worth $119 billion last quarter, second only to Goodwin by deal volume.

Total M&A activity reached more than $5.9 trillion in 2021, according to year-end data from Refinitiv, the strongest showing since tracking began in 1980.

Last year's boom in M&A fueled a hiring boom for law firm associates, and many leading corporate firms offered multiple rounds of bonuses and raised salaries to keep lawyers from jumping ship.

A slowdown in deal volume will squeeze law firm profits, said Marcie Borgal Shunk, a law firm consultant at The Tilt Institute. Other consultants have warned that some firms might let some lawyers go if M&A work dries up.

But it's too soon for dire predictions about the effects of an M&A slowdown, consultants said. It can take law firms ""several quarters"" to make a hard decision like laying off lawyers, said Kristin Stark, a principal at law firm consultancy Tilt Institute.

Matt Toole, director of deals intelligence at Refinitiv, pointed in a statement to market bright spots, singling out technology, private equity buyouts and mega deals. He suggested low interest rates and healthy corporate coffers would continue to fuel deal activity.

""Despite the headlines, the fundamental drivers of deal making are still the same,"" Toole said.

56,350,Microsoft,2022-04-05,Darktrace shares fall after JPM starts coverage with 'underweight' rating,"













April 5 (Reuters) - Rising costs are likely to dent cyber security firm Darktrace's (DARK.L) profit growth, J.P.Morgan analysts said on Tuesday, as they started coverage of the stock with an ""underweight"" rating.

J.P.Morgan is the only brokerage among seven to have an ""underweight"" rating, the equivalent of a ""sell"" rating, on the company's shares.

Darktrace's stock fell nearly 8% to 416p, the lowest in more than a month.

The company's latest forecast implied a year-on-year increase in net constant currency annual recurring revenue (ARR) of between 24% and 29%, versus previous forecast of 19% to 24%. read more

""With ARR growth tied to new customer acquisitions, we believe that higher customer acquisition and retention costs are likely to challenge the company's ability to deliver profitable growth,"" J.P.Morgan analyst Varun Rajwanshi said.

Darktrace earlier this month raised its full-year revenue and margin outlook, reflecting strong customer growth and retention.

A push by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google in cloud traffic and email security poses a threat to Darktrace, Rajwanshi said.

""A growing list of vendors that seek to combine different point security solution offerings ... will only increase the competitive intensity for Darktrace, whose (cybersecurity) offerings are a complement (rather than a replacement),"" according to the J.P.Morgan note.

The brokerage expects the sum of revenue growth and free cash flow margins to remain below 40% over the next couple of years and in turn push Darktrace's valuation below that of its peers.

57,583,Microsoft,2022-04-06,Biden pick Vidal confirmed for empowered patent and trademark chief role,"Summary

Summary Law firms Former Winston & Strawn litigator Kathi Vidal received bipartisan support to lead the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office

Likely to be closely scrutinized on patent-eligibility issues















(Reuters) - The U.S. Senate confirmed former Winston & Strawn partner Kathi Vidal as director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in a voice vote Tuesday night.

She will lead the office at a time when the question of what can be patented is under close scrutiny, and is poised to wield more power than past PTO directors on patent policy.

Patent attorneys have called Vidal, who led Winston & Strawn's Silicon Valley office, ""eminently qualified"" for the role. In private practice she represented tech companies including Microsoft Corp, Tesla Inc, Intel Corp, Dell Corp and Spotify Technologies SA.

Her nomination by President Joe Biden received bipartisan support from the Senate Judiciary committee earlier this year.

Vidal will have more power over patent decisions than previous PTO heads, following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year that gave the director authority to review patent-eligibility rulings from the office's Patent Trial and Appeal Board.

Previous PTO director Andrei Iancu was known for policies seen as favoring patent owners compared to Obama's PTO director Michelle Lee, and an internal policy during his tenure reduced the number of patents that the board invalidated.

Vidal will have to walk a fine line to balance the interests of those who broadly supported Iancu's PTAB policies, like major pharmaceutical companies, and those who broadly oppose them, like major tech companies.

Iancu, now a partner at Irell & Manella, said in a statement after Tuesday's vote that the office was in ""excellent hands"" with Vidal.

Vidal also joins the PTO amid heightened disagreement and confusion in the courts over when an invention can be patented, with a potential landmark Supreme Court case pending on the issue. She has argued both for and against patent eligibility in cases at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and said during a Senate hearing that there should be ""more clarity"" on the issue.

58,811,Microsoft,2022-04-06,AI is explaining itself to humans. And it's paying off,"[1/2] A 3D-printed logo of Microsoft is seen in front of a displayed LinkedIn logo in this illustration taken June 13, 2016. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic















OAKLAND, Calif., April 6 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) LinkedIn boosted subscription revenue by 8% after arming its sales team with artificial intelligence software that not only predicts clients at risk of canceling, but also explains how it arrived at its conclusion.

The system, introduced last July and described in a LinkedIn blog post on Wednesday, marks a breakthrough in getting AI to ""show its work"" in a helpful way.

While AI scientists have no problem designing systems that make accurate predictions on all sorts of business outcomes, they are discovering that to make those tools more effective for human operators, the AI may need to explain itself through another algorithm.

The emerging field of “Explainable AI,” or XAI, has spurred big investment in Silicon Valley as startups and cloud giants compete to make opaque software more understandable and has stoked discussion in Washington and Brussels where regulators want to ensure automated decision-making is done fairly and transparently.

AI technology can perpetuate societal biases like those around race, gender and culture. read more Some AI scientists view explanations as a crucial part of mitigating those problematic outcomes.

U.S. consumer protection regulators including the Federal Trade Commission have warned over the last two years that AI that is not explainable could be investigated. The EU next year could pass the Artificial Intelligence Act, a set of comprehensive requirements including that users be able to interpret automated predictions.

Proponents of explainable AI say it has helped increase the effectiveness of AI’s application in fields such as healthcare and sales. Google Cloud (GOOGL.O) sells explainable AI services that, for instance, tell clients trying to sharpen their systems which pixels and soon which training examples mattered most in predicting the subject of a photo.

But critics say the explanations of why AI predicted what it did are too unreliable because the AI technology to interpret the machines is not good enough.

LinkedIn and others developing explainable AI acknowledge that each step in the process - analyzing predictions, generating explanations, confirming their accuracy and making them actionable for users - still has room for improvement.

But after two years of trial and error in a relatively low-stakes application, LinkedIn says its technology has yielded practical value. Its proof is the 8% increase in renewal bookings during the current fiscal year above normally expected growth. LinkedIn declined to specify the benefit in dollars, but described it as sizeable.

Before, LinkedIn salespeople relied on their own intuition and some spotty automated alerts about clients' adoption of services.

Now, the AI quickly handles research and analysis. Dubbed CrystalCandle by LinkedIn, it calls out unnoticed trends and its reasoning helps salespeople hone their tactics to keep at-risk customers on board and pitch others on upgrades.

LinkedIn says explanation-based recommendations have expanded to more than 5,000 of its sales employees spanning recruiting, advertising, marketing and education offerings.

""It has helped experienced salespeople by arming them with specific insights to navigate conversations with prospects. It’s also helped new salespeople dive in right away,"" said Parvez Ahammad, LinkedIn's director of machine learning and head of data science applied research.

TO EXPLAIN OR NOT TO EXPLAIN?

In 2020, LinkedIn had first provided predictions without explanations. A score with about 80% accuracy indicates the likelihood a client soon due for renewal will upgrade, hold steady or cancel.

Salespeople were not fully won over. The team selling LinkedIn's Talent Solutions recruiting and hiring software were unclear on how to adapt their strategy, especially when the odds of a client not renewing were no better than a coin toss.

Last July, they started seeing a short, auto-generated paragraph that highlights the factors influencing the score.

For instance, the AI decided a customer was likely to upgrade because it grew by 240 workers over the past year and candidates had become 146% more responsive in the last month.

In addition, an index that measures a client's overall success with LinkedIn recruiting tools surged 25% in the last three months.

Lekha Doshi, LinkedIn's vice president of global operations, said that based on the explanations sales representatives now direct clients to training, support and services that improve their experience and keep them spending.

But some AI experts question whether explanations are necessary. They could even do harm, engendering a false sense of security in AI or prompting design sacrifices that make predictions less accurate, researchers say.

Fei-Fei Li, co-director of Stanford University's Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, said people use products such as Tylenol and Google Maps whose inner workings are not neatly understood. In such cases, rigorous testing and monitoring have dispelled most doubts about their efficacy.

Similarly, AI systems overall could be deemed fair even if individual decisions are inscrutable, said Daniel Roy, an associate professor of statistics at University of Toronto.

LinkedIn says an algorithm's integrity cannot be evaluated without understanding its thinking.

It also maintains that tools like its CrystalCandle could help AI users in other fields. Doctors could learn why AI predicts someone is more at risk of a disease, or people could be told why AI recommended they be denied a credit card.

The hope is that explanations reveal whether a system aligns with concepts and values one wants to promote, said Been Kim, an AI researcher at Google.

""I view interpretability as ultimately enabling a conversation between machines and humans,"" she said.

Summary Companies HP jumps after Buffett's Berkshire reveals stake

U.S. weekly jobless claims fall

Indexes end: Dow +0.25%, S&P 500 +0.43%, Nasdaq +0.06%















April 7 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended higher on Thursday, with Pfizer and Tesla fueling a late-session rally while investors eyed the war in Ukraine and a potentially more aggressive Federal Reserve.

Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) rose 1.2% and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) added 0.6%, helping lift the S&P 500 and provide the Nasdaq a modest gain.

Also supporting the S&P 500, Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) jumped 4.3%after it said it would buy privately held ReViral Ltd in a deal worth as much as $525 million, its second acquisition in less than six months to boost its drug portfolio. read more

The S&P traded at a loss for much of the day before rallying near the end of the session.

“We don't know how Ukraine is going resolve itself. We don't know how this hawkish Fed is going to impact the economy. We don't know if they can navigate a soft landing. What it equals is a whipsaw market,” said Dennis Dick, a trader at Bright Trading LLC. “If you're following trends, then you're lost in this market because all this market is is chop.”

Mega-cap growth stocks came under pressure earlier this week after comments from Fed policymakers and minutes from the central bank's March meeting suggested a rapid removal of stimulus measures put in place during the pandemic.

St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the U.S. central bank's short-term policy rate should reach 3.5% later this year.

Minutes released on Wednesday showed that Fed officials ""generally agreed"" to cut up to $95 billion a month from the central bank's asset holdings even as the war in Ukraine tempered the first U.S. interest rate increase since 2018. read more

""The realization for investors continues that the Fed is still not at max hawkishness and we're going to err on the side of them wanting to do more to continue to control inflation,"" said Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital Network, an investment marketplace firm.

U.S. companies will start reporting first-quarter results in the coming weeks, with banks set to kick off the season in earnest next week. Analysts on average expect S&P 500 companies' earnings to have grown 6.4% in the March quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. That compares with over 30% growth in the prior quarter.

""As we get into the heart of earnings season, I expect volatility to be very prominent,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""We could see strong results that beat the highest expectations, but weak expectations for the next 12 months.""

Among the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes, real estate (.SPLRCR) was among the deepest decliners, while the health sector index (.SPXHC) was among the top gainers.

Adding to cautious sentiment, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Ukraine had presented Moscow with a draft peace deal that contained ""unacceptable"" elements, while the U.S. Senate voted to remove ""most favored nation"" trade status for Russia in one bill and ban oil imports in another. read more

Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 0.25% to end at 34,583.57 points, while the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 0.43% to 4,500.21.

The Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) climbed 0.06% to 13,897.30.

With investors worried about the effect of rising interest rates, growth stocks with pricey valuations have underperformed value stocks so far in 2022.

60,658,Microsoft,2022-04-07,Moped charger gets trapped in electric-car traffic,"













HONG KONG, April 7 (Reuters Breakingviews) - It’s hard to imagine Asia’s congested cities without the phut-phut of a thousand mopeds. Shares in Taiwan’s Gogoro (PPGH.O) have jumped 16% since their New York debut on Tuesday. Yet the valuation of the $2.6 billion company, which makes battery-swapping systems for electric two-wheelers, trails most car-charging outfits. There are risks, but Asia’s love of the zippy mode of transport means the gap deserves to narrow.

Chief Executive Horace Luke founded 11-year-old Gogoro after a career that included designing Microsoft’s (MSFT.O)original Xbox. At home, the company’s batteries power its own mopeds as well as those made by rivals like Yamaha Motor (7272.T). Its float, via a merger with blank-cheque firm Poema Global, netted it some $345 million in total with investments from partners such as India’s Hero Motocorp (HROM.NS) and GoTo, the Indonesian super-app. Singapore’s state fund Temasek, Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management and sustainability activist Engine No. 1 also took stakes.

At 2.8 times its own 2023 sales forecast, Gogoro sits toward the back of the car-charging parade including Tritium (DCFC.O) and Allego , both of which also went public recently after merging with special-purpose acquisition vehicles. The average multiple of six of them is a speedy 11 times revenue. At 18 times EBITDA, Gogoro’s enterprise value is more middle of the road but the company already reports positive numbers, which is more than most.

Gogoro’s selling point is the relative ease of building its charging networks in Asia’s dense cities. It’s eyeing urban India, Indonesia and China via joint ventures with partners including Hero, GoTo and two Chinese bike makers. Pollution-battling politicians like electric two-wheelers and Gogoro’s business model has appeal, too. Selling the scooter without the battery drops prices to roughly in line with petrol-powered peers while then renting the power source produces recurring revenue for Gogoro, as does licensing its technology to its JVs.

Luke is however not alone in figuring this out. In India, rivals already have manufacturing partners. Hero, the country’s bike-making behemoth, is only just getting into the electric game. Citywide rollouts carry risk too if demand doesn’t follow although Gogoro believes its monitoring system, covering battery charge, location and health, helps it deploy funds efficiently.

Two-wheelers are a modest form of transport, but the ability of electric mopeds to change the sound of city life is anything but.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Taiwan-based Gogoro began trading on Nasdaq on April 5 after its $2.4 billion merger with Poema Global Holdings, a special-purpose acquisition company founded by a group of investment bankers and private equity executives.

- Gogoro is building a battery-swapping network that can be used both by its own scooters and those of other manufacturers which adopt its hardware.

- Investors in its New York float include Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management and sustainability activist Engine No. 1. Some of its joint-venture partners also took stakes: India’s Hero Motocorp, Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn, and GoTo, the Indonesian super-app with which it has a deal to roll out electric bikes to its driver fleet. Singapore state investor Temasek has also backed the firm.

61,260,Microsoft,2022-04-07,Activision to convert over thousand temporary workers to full-time roles,"













April 7 (Reuters) - Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) said on Thursday nearly 1,100 U.S.-based temporary and contingent quality assurance workers of some divisions will be converted to full-time employees, starting July 1.

The ""Call of Duty"" maker, which is being acquired by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) for $68.7 billion, said it will raise the minimum hourly wages for these employees - from the Activision Publishing and Blizzard divisions - to $20 or more and also offer them access to full company benefits.

This change will increase Activision Publishing division's total full-time staff by 25%.

""This change follows a process that began last year across AP and Blizzard of converting temporary and contingent employees, including 500 at AP's studios, to permanent full-time employees,"" said an Activision Blizzard spokesperson.

The company has been the subject of investigative stories detailing allegations of sexual harassment internally, and its employees have staged walkouts to protest against its response to the issues. Last year July, California regulators filed a lawsuit, alleging Activision ""fostered a sexist culture.""

62,94,Microsoft,2022-04-07,Microsoft says it disrupted attempted hacks by Russian spies,"













April 7 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Thursday it had disrupted hacking attempts by Russian military spies aimed at breaking into Ukrainian, European Union, and American targets.

In a blog post, the tech firm said a group it nicknamed ""Strontium"" was using seven internet domains as part of an effort to spy on government bodies and think tanks in the EU and the United States, as well as Ukrainian institutions such as media organizations.

Microsoft did not identify any of the targets by name.

Strontium is Microsoft's moniker for a group others often call Fancy Bear or APT28 - a hacking squad linked to Russia's military intelligence agency.

The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

Ukraine has been buffeted by hacking attempts since Russian forces invaded the country in February.

63,724,Microsoft,2022-04-08,Wall St Week Ahead Beaten-down growth stocks alluring as Fed slows U.S. economy,"













NEW YORK, April 7 (Reuters) - Some investors are looking for bargains in beaten-down growth and tech stocks, betting they will shine as the Federal Reserve fights to slow the US economy and tame red-hot inflation.

Growth stocks – which have trounced their valued-focused peers over the last decade – have borne the brunt of the Federal Reserve’s hawkish turn this year, with the Russell 1000 Growth index down more than 11% year-to-date, compared to a more-than 5% loss for the benchmark S&P 500 index.

By contrast, value stocks – often defined as shares of economically sensitive companies trading at a discount to their total worth – are broadly flat on the year.

Underpinning those moves is the perception that the Fed’s fight against inflation will keep interest rates climbing, eroding the future cash flows that growth stocks are heavily valued on. Value stocks, meanwhile, have found support from a strong economy and surging commodity prices.

That dynamic could change if the Fed’s tightening monetary policy slows the economy. That would boost the appeal of growth names for some investors who believe their profits rely less on broader economic strength. The Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points last month and has hinted at meatier increases ahead.L2N2W41S3

Expectations of an aggressive Fed briefly turned the spread between yields on two and 10-year Treasuries negative last week, a phenomenon that is often seen as an indication of worries about economic growth. Recessions have followed six of the last seven yield curve inversions since 1978, according to data from Truist Advisory Services.

“If these recession fears grow, then you are going to have a big shift away from value stocks,” said Esty Dwek, chief investment officer at FlowBank, who has been increasing her stake in technology stocks. “Sustainable earnings growth … will become more important again.”

Growth stocks have tended to outperform in the six months following yield curve inversions, with the Russell 1000 Growth Index rising by an average of 6.4% during such periods since 1978, compared to a 4.4 % gain for value stocks, data from CFRA showed. Growth stocks have fallen by an average of 0.6% during recessions, while value stocks have fallen by an average 6.8%, according to CFRA data.

The Russell 1000 Growth Index is up 320% over the last 10 years, compared to an 145% rise for its value-focused counterpart.

Earnings season kicks off next week, giving investors a closer look at how companies have fared at a time of heightened geopolitical uncertainty and rising commodity prices. Also on tap is the latest US consumer prices report, due out on Tuesday. The S&P 500 (.SPX) is on track to close down 1% this week, as worries over a more aggressive Fed slow a rally that saw the index pare its year-to-date losses last month. L2N2W411P

Overall, investors have sent a net $4.2 billion to the Invesco QQQ Trust - which tracks the growth-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index - over the last three weeks, the fund's longest streak of positive inflows since January, Lipper data showed.

Mayukh Poddar, a portfolio manager of Altfest Personal Wealth Management, has increased exposure to growth stocks in healthcare such as Boston Scientific (BSX.N) and mega-cap tech names like Microsoft (MSFT.O) in anticipation that the Fed's hawkish tilt will slow the economy, hurting value stocks.

""The Fed is telling us ... that fighting inflation has become their priority and the only way they can fight that is to slow down demand,"" he said.

Some on Wall Street are skeptical of a bounce in growth stocks, especially as bond yields continue soaring. Yields on the US benchmark 10-year Treasury recently hit 2.71%, their highest level since 2019.

“The period of extremely low interest rates was very good for growth stocks ― and very challenging for value investors,” wrote Tony DeSpirito, chief investment officer, U.S. Fundamental Equities at Blackrock, in a recent note. “The road ahead is likely to be different, restoring some of the appeal of a value strategy.”

Others believe it is just a matter of picking the right stocks.

Moustapha Mounah, an assistant portfolio manager with James Investment, has cut his energy stock exposure to 8% of his portfolio from 12%, while moving into software companies such as Abobe and SalesForce that he expects will be able to raise prices amid continued high inflation.

""The growth stocks that are really getting hurt are the speculative names, but there are many companies out there that will do well regardless of the cycle in the economy,"" he said.

Summary Law firms Miranda Cole represented Microsoft in ZeniMax deal, Disney in Twenty-First Century Fox deal

Cole is based in Brussels















(Reuters) - Global law firm Norton Rose Fulbright has hired a Covington & Burling antitrust partner who has represented Microsoft Corp, Walt Disney Co and Facebook in multi-billion dollar deals.

Miranda Cole said the size of Norton Rose Fulbright's antitrust practice was a draw. The firm said it has more than 150 antitrust and competition lawyers across 20 countries.

At Covington, Cole represented Microsoft as the tech giant executed its biggest gaming acquisition at the time in 2020 -- the $7.5 billion purchase of ZeniMax Media. ZeniMax owns multiple video game studios that make and publish games in the Doom, Fallout and The Elder Scrolls series.

Cole represented Walt Disney Co in its $71 billion acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's film and television assets, bringing the ""X-Men,"" ""Avatar"" and ""Simpsons"" franchises under its banner.

She also represented Facebook in its $1 billion acquisition of Instagram and its $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp.

Cole said that given the UK's exit from the European Union, law firms will need teams who can cover both the EU and UK competition authorities in parallel.

""You need to be able to pivot your capacity in the cases as you do them,"" Cole said.

U.S. and international law firms have been beefing up their antitrust practices for the past several months.

In April alone, Kirkland & Ellis has hired a former Allen & Overy partner, while Latham & Watkins took on the former leader of the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division.

April 11 (Reuters) - Epic Games said on Monday it had raised $2 billion from Sony Group Corp (6758.T) and the family owned holding company behind the Lego Group, valuing the ""Fortnite"" creator at $31.5 billion.

Sony, an existing investor, and the Kirkbi investment company each invested $1 billion, Epic said, with the fundraising to help advance a metaverse partnership the company had entered into with the Lego Group earlier this month.

Metaverse is the latest buzzword in the technology space, and broadly refers to the idea of a shared virtual platform that people can access through different devices and where they can move through digital environments.

Deals are picking up pace in the segment as tech giants see it to be a major innovation and revenue generator.

Microsoft (MSFT.O) in January agreed to buy ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) for $68.7 billion, marking the biggest acquisition in the gaming sector and boosting the industry's bet on the metaverse. read more

""Fortnite"" is already considered to be part of the metaverse, and the investment in Epic will give Sony a chance to delve deeper and capitalize on that business.

Epic Games has largely lost a trial last year over whether Apple's (AAPL.O) payment rules for apps were anticompetitive. That decision found Apple had suitable reasons to force some app makers such as Epic to use its payment system and take commissions of 15% to 30% on their sales.

April 11 (Reuters) - Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) has appointed former Accenture executive Kristen Hines as its new chief diversity, equity and inclusion officer, the ""Call of Duty"" maker that has been under fire for the culture at the company said on Monday.

California in July last year brought a lawsuit against the company alleging it ""fostered a sexist culture"". Activision has also been the subject of investigative stories detailing allegations of sexual harassment internally, with employees staging walkouts to protest the company's response to the issues. read more

Workers in November last year circulated a petition calling for the removal of Chief Executive Officer Bobby Kotick amid mounting criticism of the culture at the company.

Hines joined Accenture in 2006 and until early this month led the Global Inclusion, Diversity and Equity practice at the company.

Activision, which is being acquired by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) for $68.7 billion, said that Hines will partner across its gaming teams to ensure that diverse and inclusive perspectives are included in game design, including storylines and character development.

""Hines will play a crucial role in furthering Activision Blizzard's commitment to increasing the percentage of women and non-binary people in its workforce by fifty percent over the next five years,"" the video game maker added. Hines will take on the role effective April 25.

Summary Law firms The firm advised ReKTGlobal in its acquisition by metaverse company Infinite Reality

Other firms worked on Epic Games' deal with Sony to lead its advance into the metaverse















(Reuters) - O'Melveny & Myers said Tuesday it's guiding New York-based sports and entertainment company ReKTGlobal Inc in its $470 million acquisition by metaverse development company Infinite Reality LLC, as big firm client interest grows in virtual world environments.

ReKTGlobal, which focuses on global e-sports, aims to use Infinite Reality's gaming, virtual and remote production and metaverse creation resources to grow, according to a Tuesday statement.

The term metaverse broadly refers to the idea of a shared virtual platform that users can access through different devices and where they can move through digital environments.

The legal team at O'Melveny for ReKTGlobal was led by the co-chair of the firm's sports industry group, Charles Baker, along with M&A and corporate transactions partner Noah Kornblith, according to the law firm.

Infinite Reality's general counsel Eric Cohen led the transaction for the company, it said.

Large law firms also figured in North Carolina-based Epic Games Inc's metaverse-driven fundraising deal unveiled Monday.

Epic said that it had raised $2 billion from Tokyo-based Sony Group Corp and Billon, Denmark-based Kirkbi investment company to advance an existing metaverse partnership deal with the Lego Group, which is owned by Kirkbi.

The partnership between Epic and the Lego Group aims to build a family-focused virtual space in the metaverse.

Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton said in a statement it represented Sony. Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati represented Epic, according to news reports.

A spokesperson for Kirkbi said a U.S.-based law firm represented the company in the deal, but declined to disclose the firm's name.

At the top of this year, Microsoft Corp made a $69 billion bet on the metaverse when it acquired Activision Blizzard in the largest-ever transaction in the video-gaming sector.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett was the lead advisor for Microsoft in the deal and Activision Blizzard was represented by Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.

Summary Companies PlayStation, Nintendo Switch to help stop over-paying

Microsoft has made similar pledges for Xbox services

CMA says ends probe into online gaming subscriptions















April 13 (Reuters) - Britain's competition regulator said it had secured commitments from Japan's Sony and Nintendo to make it clear to customers how the companies automatically renew online gaming subscriptions, after a three-year sector investigation.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) began its inquiry in 2019 to check whether ""roll-over"" contracts for gaming services from Sony (6758.T), Nintendo (7974.T) and U.S. tech giant Microsoft (MSFT.O) were fair to customers.

It said in a statement on Wednesday that it had ended its probe after receiving undertakings relating to Sony's PlayStation Plus and the Nintendo Switch Online service. Microsoft made similar pledges for its Xbox services in January. read more

Sony has agreed measures to prevent customers from paying for its services when they have not used it for a long time, the CMA said, adding that the Nintendo Switch Online Service is no longer sold with automatic renewal as the default option.

Nintendo and Sony did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment on their CMA undertakings.

PlayStation Plus services start at 6.99 pounds ($9.1) per month in Britain, while Nintendo Switch Online is available for 3.49 pounds. Sony's PlayStation has for years enjoyed a more steady stream of exclusive games, making it a market leader.

""A number of changes have been made across (the online gaming) sector to protect customers and help tackle concerns about auto-renewing subscriptions,"" Michael Grenfell, executive director of enforcement at the CMA, said.

Grenfell called on firms in other sectors to also review their renewal practices.

The CMA previously looked at the subscription rules of anti-virus software providers in an effort to bring transparency to how customers are charged for services they use or no longer use.

69,495,Microsoft,2022-04-14,"WhatsApp tests new feature to organize groups for work, school","













April 14 (Reuters) - WhatsApp is testing a new feature called Communities to organize groups in larger structures that could be used by workplaces or schools, the messaging service owned by Meta Platforms (FB.O) said on Thursday.

WhatsApp head Will Cathcart said the feature would bring together groups, which are capped at 256 users, under bigger umbrellas where administrators could send alerts to a community of thousands.

""This is really oriented at the communities you're already a part of in your life that are doing private communication,"" said Cathcart in an interview with Reuters, citing Salesforce-owned (CRM.N) Slack or Microsoft Teams (MSFT.O) as comparable types of communication.

He said there were no current plans to charge for the new feature, which is being beta tested with a small number of global communities, but did not rule out offering ""premium features to enterprise"" in the future.

The messaging service, which is end-to-end encrypted and has about 2 billion users, said the Communities feature would also be end-to-end encrypted.

WhatsApp has grappled with abuses including bulk messaging and the spread of misinformation and hate speech. Cathcart said users would not be able to search for different Communities on WhatsApp and that it would use anti-abuse tools and safeguards like forwarding limits for the new feature.

WhatsApp said there would also be changes to its Groups feature before the launch of Communities. It said it was adding the ability for group administrators to remove problematic messages from everyone's chat, introducing voice calling for up to 32 people, increasing file sharing to 2 gigabytes and adding emoji reactions to messages.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a Thursday post that Communities would be rolled out over the coming months. He said Meta would be building community messaging features for Facebook, Messenger and Instagram.

Meta also plans to roll out end-to-end encryption across the other messaging services on its apps as part of its ongoing, declared pivot towards privacy.

70,570,Microsoft,2022-04-14,Musk says U.S. SEC 'bastards' forced settlement over Tesla tweets,"













April 14 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk on Thursday stepped up criticism of the U.S. securities regulator, calling Securities and Exchange Commission officials ""bastards"" for bringing fraud charges against him over his 2018 tweets regarding taking the company private.

On the day he made major news by unveiling a $43 billion cash takeover offer for social media company Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), Musk aired his grievances toward the SEC during remarks at the TED Conference in Vancouver. read more

Musk, the world's richest person according to a Forbes tally, said funding to take his electrical car company private was actually secured at the time he posted his tweets, but the agency ""pursued the active public investigation nonetheless.""

""So I was forced to concede to the SEC unlawfully. Those bastards,"" Musk told the audience.

Musk said he felt forced to settle with the SEC because banks threatened to cease providing capital if he did not do so, which would have made Tesla bankrupt immediately.

""So that's like having a gun to your child's head,"" Musk said.

""I was forced to admit that I lied to save Tesla's life and that's the only reason,"" Musk added.

Musk and Tesla each paid $20 million civil fines - and Musk stepped down as Tesla's chairman - to resolve SEC claims that Musk defrauded investors on Aug. 7, 2018, by posting on Twitter that he had ""funding secured"" to take the company private. The SEC said at the time his funding tweets ""lacked an adequate basis in fact.""

A related consent decree also required Musk to obtain pre-clearance from Tesla lawyers for tweets and other public statements that could be material to Tesla.

A spokesperson for the SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.

Musk rejected an invitation to join Twitter's board last Saturday after disclosing his current more than 9% stake. He was required to have disclosed that he held a stake exceeding 5 percent in Twitter and is expected to invite regulatory scrutiny for missing a deadline to disclose such a stake and filing the wrong form, according to securities experts.

On launching his Twitter takeover bid, Musk said he made the offer because he believes ""it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech."" Musk said he believes Twitter's algorithm should be open-source and suggested the code behind it should be available on Github, a Microsoft-owned platform for sharing code for software development.

Asked if he had the financing to do the deal, Musk said: ""I have sufficient assets. I can do it if possible."" He did not offer details.

71,698,Microsoft,2022-04-18,Breakingviews: Twitter’s habitat lacks natural predators,"













NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The best buyer for Twitter (TWTR.N) may be nobody. The social network on Friday enacted a “poison pill” read more , temporarily blocking Elon Musk’s $41 billion takeover bid, but putting it in play. As Twitter learned in 2016 when multiple suitors walked away, closing a deal can be harder.

Musk’s offer of $54.20 per share, which is non-binding and lacks financing, is easy for Twitter to dismiss. It also shows the steep financial hill buyers will have to climb. The Tesla (TSLA.O) boss would earn an unattractive return of about 1% on his investment by 2024, according to a Breakingviews analysis read more using estimates compiled by Refinitiv. Reducing the board’s salaries to zero, as Musk claimed in a tweet on Monday, barely changes that calculation. Besides, the board would probably demand a higher premium before recommending a deal.

Twitter’s meager cash flow makes it hard for financial buyers like Thoma Bravo to finance a takeover with lots of debt. Private equity investors could join forces with Musk, who owns more than 9% of the company. But that would mean playing junior partner to the entrepreneur, whose ideas for Twitter appear to include upending its advertising business.

Microsoft (MSFT.O), Meta Platforms (FB.O) or Alphabet (GOOGL.O) might see an opportunity to squeeze more advertising revenue out of Twitter’s community of devoted users. But regulators in America and Europe read more have made it clear they will oppose any deals that make technology giants even more powerful.

Salesforce.com (CRM.N) wanted to buy Twitter in 2016, when the social network was roughly half its current size, but abandoned the effort after its stock fell on the news. Shareholders in the $188 billion software group are unlikely to be more receptive now. Brand-conscious buyers, meanwhile, will be wary. Former Walt Disney (DIS.N) CEO Bob Iger said he walked away in 2016 because of the “nastiness” on Twitter’s platform. Attempts to reduce negativity and disinformation may please advertisers but put off users like Musk, who worry it restricts free speech.

Musk’s interest shows that a lack of obvious financial logic may not prevent a deal. A more likely outcome, however, might be a partial investment, perhaps by a private equity firm. Silver Lake in 2020 invested $1 billion in Twitter through a convertible note, helping to finance a share buyback to get activist Elliott Management onside. The company could use a similar deal to buy Musk out of his stake. It would be a reminder that Twitter’s habitat lacks natural predators.

April 18 (Reuters) - Gaming companies FlickPlay and The Sandbox announced a new partnership on Monday that will allow players to use a blockchain asset on both platforms, representing a key step in the building of the metaverse.

The idea of the metaverse involves people moving freely between virtual worlds on different platforms and taking their virtual clothing and other belongings with them, a concept called interoperability.

Such an idea is many years away and will require collaboration between companies and metaverse developers, including Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Epic Games. read more

FlickPlay is an app where players can unlock digital collectibles by using an interactive map of their actual surroundings, and then use their phone's camera to overlay the collectibles onto the real world and interact with the objects to make videos and other content. On Monday, the app announced its first collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) called Flicky, which will feature designs of an anthropomorphic chameleon wearing different clothes. read more

A portion of people who acquire a Flicky will be able to use the NFT as their avatar on The Sandbox, a web and mobile game where players can build a three-dimensional virtual world.

Initially, Flicky owners will unlock a version of the chameleon to use on The Sandbox, but soon they will be able to use the exact version of the digital asset that is stored on the blockchain in both games, said Pierina Merino, founder and chief executive of FlickPlay, adding that the company is working with The Sandbox to reach interoperability by the end of the year.

The integration is notable because it may be the first to bridge an NFT in the virtual world with usage linked to the physical world, said Sebastien Borget, co-founder of The Sandbox.

The partnership with FlickPlay will help ""create a more immersive experience that extends into the metaverse and The Sandbox,"" he said.

73,403,Microsoft,2022-04-18,Airlines seek clearance for liftoff on sustainable aviation fuels,"Summary EU and Britain to force airlines to replace part of kerosene use with non-fossil fuels

Measures in the Biden Administration’s Infrastructure bill to help bridge high cost of SAF

Companies with net-zero commitments sign up to buy SAF, push for high environmental standards















April 11 - Aviation is one of the fastest-growing sources of emissions, and the most intractable. In the run-up to COP26 in November last year, the airline industry pledged to get to net zero by 2050, but admitted that hydrogen and electric aircraft would not be operating in significant numbers until the 2040s. Therefore 65% of the emissions reductions will need to come from replacing the kerosene used today, 450 billion litres, with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Given that use of SAF is just 100 million litres, that will involve dramatically scaling up the use of a fuel that is currently two to five times more expensive.

But a series of developments last year from policymakers, biofuel companies and corporates that have made ambitious emissions-reduction commitments have combined to bring SAF to the verge of lift-off.

First off: policy. In July 2021, the European Union proposed to force fuel suppliers to include SAF in aviation fuel supplied at EU airports, commencing in 2025 at 2% SAF, 5% from 2030, and scaling up to 63% in 2050. Britain, meanwhile, announced ahead of COP26 that it would target 10% SAF by 2030.

Airlines said mandates alone would not be enough to drive uptake: they need incentives to help bridge the high cost of SAF.

That missing piece of the puzzle came when in the United States Joe Biden’s administration announced plans for a blenders’ tax credit in the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure bill, which passed Congress in November 2021.

The administration also issued a sustainable aviation fuel challenge to the industry to replace at least 5% of conventional jet fuel demand with SAF by 2030. If realised, that would mean 3 billion gallons (11.36 billion litres) of SAF being produced in the United States by the end of the decade.

But the biggest push is arguably coming from the private sector. And it is not only from airlines and air freight companies like Deutsche Post DHL, which at COP26 in Glasgow last November agreed a new partnership with Finland’s renewable fuel company Neste enabling it to fly 200 airfreight flights a week on SAF from Britain’s East Midlands Airport.

Thousands of companies have now set net-zero commitments in line with science, and are realising that aviation emissions are a large chunk of their carbon footprint. These range from big consumer goods companies such as Amazon and Walmart, to consultancies and financial services companies like Bank of America, Deloitte and Boston Consulting Group, for whom staff air travel is their biggest emissions challenge.

At COP26, the U.S. State Department and the World Economic Forum (WEF) launched the First Movers Coalition, a platform for leading global companies to fast-track innovation in seven areas.

In aviation, participating companies have pledged by 2030 to replace 5% of their conventional jet fuel with advanced technologies that can reduce lifecycle emissions by 85% or more.

Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America, said at the launch of the First Movers Coalition that cutting aviation’s footprint will increasingly be a competitiveness issue. “We aren’t a big user of electricity, but the issue is our clients. Trillions of dollars in commitments to net zero comes from our clients,” he said.

Several members of the First Movers Coalition – including Boeing, Bank of America, Orsted, DPDHL, United and Delta airlines and Boston Consulting Group – are in another WEF initiative, the 60-member Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition, an alliance formed earlier in 2021 to power global aviation with 10% SAF by 2030.

In June 2021, the coalition launched a sustainable aviation fuel certificate framework, a “book and claim” system where companies seeking to offset their corporate flights can purchase certificates that will cover SAF’s price premium.

Microsoft, for example, has bought certificates from Alaska Airlines and SAF producer SkyNRG to cover employee travel between Seattle and three Californian airports. It is also purchasing certificates in another pilot project announced last September with Air BP and United Airlines to supply 26,500 litres of waste-based SAF at British airports.

Microsoft is one of the founding members of another partnership that came together last year, the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA), a joint project by two leading environmental non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the United States, the Rocky Mountain Institute and the Environmental Defense Fund.

Among other objectives, it plans to create a SAF certification scheme with robust environmental criteria, which SABA says will be key to overcoming concerns that SAF will lead to a surge in deforestation as land is cleared to grow bioenergy crops, threatening food security as well as biodiversity.

Indonesia, for one, is gearing up to produce aviation fuels from palm oil in commercial volumes. While the European Union has banned using palm oil in biodiesel and aviation fuels from 2030, it is not clear other jurisdictions will do the same.

In both the SkyNRG and Air BP pilots, the SAF supplied will be certified by multi-stakeholder organisation the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), whose criteria include having no adverse impacts on biodiversity or land use. RMI, a non-profit organisation working to accelerate the energy transition, and energy company EDF said there would also be robust requirements for traceability and third-party audits and verification.

Scott Kirby, CEO of United Airlines, told a panel discussion at COP26 hosted by SABA that United would not fly on SAF derived from food crops. “The north star needs to be to do the right thing, not to find the cheapest way to get to this new metric.”

While SkyNRG and Neste are using agricultural waste and used cooking oil in their biofuels, LanzaJet, based in Illinois in the United States, is producing jet fuel from CO2 captured at a steel plant in China.

LanzaJet chair, Jennifer Holmgren, signed a deal with Scandinavian Airlines (SAS), Shell and Vattenfall at COP26 exploring the feasibility of producing SAF from fossil-free electricity and captured CO2 in Sweden, which could provide SAS with up to 25% of its global demand for sustainable aviation fuel.

In the United States, LanzaJet is building a plant in Georgia to convert ethanol into jet fuel, a first of its kind plant that is due to start operating in 2023, with a target of 40 million litre capacity. It has funding from the U.S. Department of Energy, and from investors Suncor, Mitsui, Japanese airline ANA, British Airways and Shell.

Last month, Microsoft announced it will invest $50 million from its Climate Innovation Fund in the Georgia facility, and use renewable diesel produced by the plant to power its data centres.

In an interview, Holmgren said the proposed blenders’ tax credit, along with measures in Biden’s infrastructure bill to incentivise green hydrogen, should allow her company to ramp up the production of synthetic biofuels using CO2 as a feedstock. She believes LanzaJet could supply a third of the 3 billion gallons of SAF the United States wants to produce by 2030.

“The U.S. government is very clearly thinking about the end game, and what we need to incentivise today to get where we want to be in 10 years’ time,” she said.

At the same time, corporates with science-based net-zero commitments are driving demand for biofuels that meet higher sustainability standards, such as the RSB certification, which favour advanced biofuel technologies such as LanzaJet’s.

“I think the 10% target by 2030 is achievable because so many of the (waste-based) technologies are past the demonstration stage,” Holmgren said. “I think we’re on a path to exponential growth.”

April 20 (Reuters) - Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) has won the dismissal of a lawsuit in California accusing the video game maker of misleading investors by downplaying the severity of alleged sexual harassment and discrimination against female employees.

Los Angeles-based U.S. District Judge Percy Anderson, in a decision released on Tuesday, found that a group of Activision shareholders had failed to cite specific false statements the company made amid investigations by three government agencies, and could not prove fraud claims.

Anderson gave the plaintiffs 30 days to file an amended complaint against Activision, which has denied tolerating discrimination and misleading shareholders.

The company and lawyers for the shareholders did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Anderson in his ruling said the plaintiffs failed to allege that Activision and its executives knowingly made specific false statements about the discrimination claims, writing that the complaint was ""wieldy in the extreme and rambles through long stretches of material quoted from external lawsuits.""

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) in January said it is buying Activision, the maker of ""Call of Duty"" and other games, for $68.7 billion, in the biggest gaming industry deal on record. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is conducting an antitrust review of the deal. read more

The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a California anti-discrimination agency filed separate lawsuits last year accusing Activision of tolerating widespread bias against women, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is probing the company's disclosures about workplace misconduct.

Activision settled the EEOC case last month for $18 million. The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing's lawsuit is pending.

In a proposed class action lawsuit filed in August, the shareholders said Activision's failure to disclose the scale of workplace discrimination artificially inflated the value of the company's stock. Activision stock declined sharply last year in response to news reports about the SEC probe and the company's alleged failure to address bias and sexual harassment.

75,336,Microsoft,2022-04-20,Japan opens biggest esports park to level up competitive gaming,"[1/3] Attendees at the opening ceremony of the Red Tokyo Tower esports park cut the ribbon, in Tokyo, Japan April 20, 2022. REUTERS/Sam Nussey















TOKYO, April 20 (Reuters) - Japan's largest esports park opened on Wednesday, with proponents hoping it will help transform the country behind video game classics such as Super Mario and Zelda into a champion that can take on China in competitive gaming.

""Japan's esports market is growing but still distant compared to overseas. We hope to close the gap,"" said Yasuo Hara, President of Tokyo Esports Gate, which developed the Red Tokyo Tower attraction.

Set across three floors at the base of the landmark Tokyo Tower, the park offers space for esports competition along with the latest motor racing, virtual reality and games simulators.

Japanese gamers have been slow to jump into esports, favouring home-grown role-playing console (RPG) games such as ""Final Fantasy"" and ""Dragon Quest"" and mobile titles such as ""Monster Strike"".

""It's still Donkey Kong country,"" said Serkan Toto, founder of game industry consultancy Kantan Games, referring to the classic Nintendo platforming series.

Nintendo has a loyal fanbase in Japan for its Switch device even as Sony and Microsoft battle it out in Western markets with next-generation consoles.

The Kyoto-based firm has launched major multiplayer hits ""Splatoon"" and ""Smash Bros."" but is less active in promoting competitive gaming than firms such as Riot Games, which is owned by China's Tencent.

Japanese esports reticence contrasts with neighbours South Korea and China, where enthusiasm is reflected in the competitive strength of teams in multiplayer PC titles such as ""League of Legends"" from California-based Riot.

China, where console makers have struggled to make inroads due to regulatory hurdles, will this year account for nearly a third of global esports revenue, which is driven primarily by sponsorship, according to research firm Newzoo.

The growth of streaming on platforms like Amazon's Twitch during the COVID-19 pandemic proved a tailwind for esports, with global revenue expected to near $1.38 billion this year, Newzoo estimates.

76,276,Microsoft,2022-04-20,Google to set up first Africa product development centre in Nairobi,"













NAIROBI, April 20 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O) is investing in its first ever Africa product development centre in the Kenyan capital Nairobi, it said, as it positions itself to serve a growing base of internet users on the continent.

By the end of this decade, the continent will host 800 million internet users, the California-based firm said, and a third of the world's youth population, making it an attractive investment destination.

Google is hiring engineers, product managers, user experience designers and researchers to staff the new centre, said Suzanne Frey, vice president for products, and Nitin Gajria, the head of Google Africa, in a joint blog post on Tuesday.

The company is investing $1 billion in various projects on the continent over five years, its CEO Sundar Pichai said last October, to help economies accelerate their digital transformation.

It has already opened an artificial intelligence centre in Accra, Ghana, focusing on innovations that can be applied to various challenges.

Microsoft (MSFT.O) has also been investing in technology development hubs in Kenya and Nigeria, investing $100 million and hiring hundreds of engineers in both countries.

77,244,Microsoft,2022-04-20,Sullivan & Cromwell antitrust co-head Holley departs for hedge fund,"Summary

Summary Law firms Steven Holley represented Spotify against Epic Games

He joins Select Equity Group as executive vice president















(Reuters) - Veteran antitrust lawyer Steven Holley, formerly co-head of the competition group at the Wall Street law firm Sullivan & Cromwell and who helped to defend Microsoft Corp at trial in the 1990s iconic U.S. monopoly litigation, has joined hedge fund Select Equity Group LP in New York.

Holley started his new role at Select Equity Group as an executive vice president this month, according to his LinkedIn biography. He departed 875-lawyer Sullivan & Cromwell on March 31, after a career there of more than 35 years.

At the law firm, Holley was on the team advising Spotify USA in the antitrust lawsuit Epic Games Inc brought against Apple Inc in California federal court. He also had advised clients including FCA USA LLC and Amazon.com Inc.

Holley and a spokesperson for the firm did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. Select Equity Group and its general counsel also did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.

Select Equity Group's website says the firm manages more than $40 billion in assets and that its clients include ""endowments, foundations, public and corporate pensions, private banks, family offices and high-net-worth individuals.""

Holley co-led Sullivan & Cromwell's antitrust team with Renata Hesse, who joined the firm in 2017 after leading the antitrust division at the U.S. Justice Department.

Veteran Sullivan & Cromwell trial lawyer David Tulchin had worked closely with Holley on a host of major corporate trials. Tulchin was lead national private counsel for Microsoft on antitrust, patent and other matters for more than a decade.

""Sullivan & Cromwell is going to miss him a lot,"" Tulchin told Reuters. He called his former colleague a mentor for younger lawyers and a ""terrific"" trial lawyer who was a ""clear and logical thinker."" He added that Holley was the sort of lawyer who ""everyone wishes had stayed around — an absolutely great colleague.""

In a 2016 interview with the Leaders publication, Holley spoke about the value trial lawyers brought to merger and acquisition reviews.

""Litigators bring a different skill set and, quite frankly, a different attitude to dealing with merger clearances than lawyers who have no real litigation experience,"" he said.

Having litigators involved early on, he added, means clients don't need to pay to educate new lawyers ""when the going gets tough with antitrust regulators.""

78,637,Microsoft,2022-04-21,Biden predicts Democrats could bolster Senate majority in midterms,"













PORTLAND, Ore., April 21 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Thursday predicted that his fellow Democrats could win two more U.S. Senate seats in November's midterms, strengthening the party's majority to pass his agenda despite sagging approval ratings.

Speaking at a political fundraiser in Portland during his first trip to the Pacific Northwest since taking office, Biden said he was increasing his travel schedule to make the case around the country about his administration's accomplishments.

""I'm determined to make sure we keep the House and the Senate,"" Biden told the donors. He offered no prediction for the party's prospects in the House.

High inflation and the ongoing pandemic have contributed to low poll numbers for Biden and sparked concerns that Democrats may lose control of the House of Representatives and the Senate to Republicans after the November election.

Addressing an evening fundraiser hosted in Seattle by Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Biden weighed in on the clash between Republican state lawmakers in Florida and the Walt Disney Co. (DIS.N) over legislation to limit the teaching of LGBTQ issues in schools.

The state's Republican-controlled legislature on Thursday voted to strip Disney of its self-governing authority on lands occupied by its Orlando theme parks in retaliation for Disney's opposition to the school restrictions, derided by critics as the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill.

Governor Ron DeSantis, a potential 2024 Republican presidential nominee who fiercely backs the ban on classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity for children under age 9, is expected to sign the bill into law. read more

Biden said Republican-led efforts to impose such constraints ""have nothing to do with traditional conservative doctrine.""

""I respect conservatives. There's nothing conservative about deciding you're going to throw Disney out of its present posture because Mickey Mouse ... should ... not be able to say, you know, gay.""

Earlier on Thursday, Biden touted his administration's progress on infrastructure, including new spending made possible by the passage of the roughly $1 trillion infrastructure law that includes investments in highways and broadband. The bill allocates $1.2 billion for Oregon and $8.6 billion for the state of Washington.

Biden visited Portland's airport to talk about investing in a runway that can withstand earthquakes.

He was scheduled to spend Thursday night and Friday in Seattle, where he will observe Earth Day and talk about his administration's plans to tame inflation.

""We're here today to talk about investments we're making to modernize this airport,"" Biden said in his earlier address. ""So through the bipartisan infrastructure law, we're investing $25 billion to upgrade and modernize American airports.""

White House officials have said in recent weeks that they hope to shift their outreach strategy to voters by visiting more states to talk about the administration's accomplishments rather than describing the need for legislation that remains stalled.

Biden's public approval rating stands at 43%, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll completed on Tuesday. The two-day national poll found 51% of Americans disapprove of Biden's job performance as the country struggles with high inflation and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

That compares with approval ratings hovering above 50% at the start of his term.

79,182,Microsoft,2022-04-22,Wall St Week Ahead Stakes are high as megacap companies highlight big earnings week,"













NEW YORK, April 22 (Reuters) - Investors are hoping a flood of U.S. quarterly reports next week, including those from megacap growth titans, will confirm a solid profit outlook for corporate America and bolster the case for stocks after a rocky start to the year.

Nearly 180 companies in the S&P 500, worth roughly half of the benchmark index's market value, are due to report results next week. They include the four biggest U.S. companies by market capitalization: Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O).

The latest round of earnings comes amid a backdrop of hawkishness from the Federal Reserve and a rapid rise in bond yields that has sparked unease about whether policymakers will damage the economy as they fight the worst inflation in nearly four decades. The S&P 500 has moved lower in April and was down 10.4% so far this year after a sharp selloff on Friday. read more

With monetary policy weighing on stocks, bullish investors are counting on a solid corporate outlook to support markets, ratcheting up pressure on companies to report solid bottom-line results and forecasts. S&P 500 companies are estimated to increase earnings by 9% this year, according to Refinitiv IBES.

“It’s probably the strongest argument you can make for owning stocks at this point, that corporate profits are still very robust,” said Charlie Ryan, portfolio manager at Evercore Wealth Management. ""Any degradation in corporate profit growth and the cadence of that would spook the market.”

So far, investors have been quick to punish shares of companies with disappointing results, particularly those that carry expensive valuations. One recent casualty has been Netflix (NFLX.O), whose shares tumbled around 35% in a single session after the streaming giant reported its first drop in subscribers in a decade.

Though stocks have declined year-to-date, the S&P 500 still has been trading at about 19 times forward earnings estimates, above its long-term average of 15.5 times.

“We are in a show-me type of environment. I think next week is critical for tech and high growth names, especially the higher valuation stocks,"" said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise. ""They better prove that they deserve these multiples right now.”

Investors will zero in on results from Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, which combined have a market value of about $8 trillion and make up one-fifth of the weight of the S&P 500. All of those megacap stocks have declined this year, with Apple down about 9%, Amazon off 13.4%, Alphabet down 17.4% and Microsoft falling 18.5%.

Earnings expectations for these companies are subdued for the quarter ended in March. Microsoft is expected to have increased adjusted earnings per share by 12% from the year-earlier period, Apple by 2%, while Alphabet is seen posting a 0.7% dip and Amazon reporting a 49% drop, according to Refinitiv data. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to increase quarterly earnings by 7.3%.

“Expectations are low, but that doesn’t mean it’s not important,"" said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson. ""If we are going to hit that 9% (earnings growth) for the year or even better than that, it’s hard to imagine we are going to do that without having better-than-expected earnings from the megacap companies.”

Aside from the top four firms, results are due next week from a range of companies including Facebook owner Meta Platforms (FB.O), payment companies Visa (V.N) and Mastercard (MA.N), oil majors Chevron (CVX.N) and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), and consumer companies Coca-Cola (KO.N) and Pepsico (PEP.O).

Beyond the bottom line results and financial outlooks, investors also will be looking to see if companies can maintain their profit margins as inflation threatens to drive up their input costs. S&P 500 companies should see net income margins dip to about 13% in 2022 from a record 13.4% last year, JPMorgan said in a note this week.

Of 99 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far, 77.8% reported earnings above analysts expectations, Refinitiv IBES said. That rate is above the typical beat rate of 66% for a quarter since 1994, but below the 83% rate over the past four quarters.

“The stock market is ... waiting for this barrage of earnings,"" Saglimbene said. The market is “beholden to what companies say about the second quarter and beyond.”

80,494,Microsoft,2022-04-22,U.S. labor board judge orders union vote at Activision studio,"













SAN FRANCISCO, April 22 (Reuters) - A regional director for the U.S. National Labor Relations Board on Friday ordered a union election for a group of workers at an Activision Blizzard-owned studio that works on the popular ""Call of Duty"" franchise, overruling objections from the company.

In a 27-page decision, Jennifer Hadsall, a regional director in Minneapolis, ordered ballots to be mailed to employees on April 29. Workers will have until May 20 to return their ballots, and counting will begin on May 23, per the decision.

The election will cover roughly 21 workers in the quality assurance department at Raven Software in Middleton, Wisconsin. The workers will vote on whether to join the Communications Workers of America, a union that has played an active role in organizing tech employees in recent months.

The vote also comes amid a surge in labor activity by workers in the tech sector. Employees at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island, New York recently voted to unionize and workers at an Apple store in Atlanta filed a petition for a union election.

An Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) spokesperson said the company was ""reviewing legal options regarding a potential appeal.""

""We are disappointed that a decision that could significantly impact the future of our entire studio will be made by fewer than 10% of our employees,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. ""We believe a direct relationship with team members is the best path to achieving individual and company goals.""

Activision had urged the NLRB to dismiss the petition for a union election, citing a recent reorganization, and argued that any vote on unionization should be conducted among a much larger group of employees. But Hadsall ruled that the proposed unit should stand, finding that the QA testers that the union seeks to represent have a ""meaningfully distinct collective-bargaining interest.""

In recent months, Activision Blizzard workers have banded together to try to influence the company's future, including staging a walkout and circulating a petition calling for the removal of Chief Executive Officer Bobby Kotick. Microsoft announced plans to acquire Activision in January.

The NLRB decision was previously reported by Bloomberg.

Summary Companies Healthcare stocks slump on HCA, Intuitive Surgical numbers

Big tech down ahead of earnings next week

Dow posts biggest one-day fall since Oct. 2020

Weekly falls: Dow 1.9%, S&P 2.8%, Nasdaq 3.8%

Indexes down on Friday: Dow 2.82%, S&P 2.77%, Nasdaq 2.55%















April 22 (Reuters) - Wall Street tumbled more than 2.5% on Friday, ensuring the three main benchmarks ended in negative territory for the week, as surprise earnings news and increased certainty around aggressive near-term interest rate rises took its toll on investors.

It was the third straight week of losses for both the S&P 500 (.SPX) and the Nasdaq (.IXIC), while the Dow Jones posted its fourth weekly decline in a row.

For the Dow, its 2.82% drop on Friday was its biggest one-day fall since October 2020.

Exaggerated trading swings have become more common recently, as traders adjust to new data points from earnings, as well as when rates will rise again. For the Nasdaq, Friday was the eighth session in April, out of 15 trading days this month, where the index either rose or fell by more than 2%.

""It's not very common, over the course of my time doing this job, for the market to move 2% in either direction and to think 'there's not too much to read into that',"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA.

""That's not normal, but that's just how things have been for such a long time now.""

Concerns about risks from interest rate hikes continued to reverberate after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's hawkish pivot on Thursday, where he backed moving more quickly to combat inflation and said a 50-basis-point increase would be ""on the table"" when the Fed meets in May. read more

The idea of ""front-end loading"" the U.S. central bank's retreat from super-easy monetary policy, which Powell articulated support for on Thursday, has also forced traders to re-evaluate how aggressive subsequent rate rises would be. read more

The CBOE Volatility index (.VIX), also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, jumped on Friday, ending at its highest level since mid-March.

Meanwhile, the latest earnings forecasts to jolt investors came from healthcare, with HCA Healthcare (HCA.N) and Intuitive Surgical Inc (ISRG.O) the worst performers on the S&P 500.

HCA slumped 21.8% after reporting a downbeat profit view, while other hospital operators felt the contagion: Tenet Healthcare (THC.N), Community Health Systems (CYH.N) and Universal Health Services (UHS.N)all tumbled between 14% and 17.9%.

Surgical robot maker Intuitive Surgical dropped 14.3% after warning of weaker demand from hospitals due to tighter finances.

All 11 major S&P 500 sectors were down, although the 3.6% slip by healthcare was outdone by materials, which was off 3.7%.

Materials (.SPLRCM) was weighed down by Nucor Corp (NUE.N) - down 8.3% after hitting a record high after posting earnings on Thursday - and Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX.N), which slipped 6.8% as investors fretted over how interest rate hikes would impact copper miners.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 981.36 points, or 2.82%, to 33,811.4, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 121.88 points, or 2.77%, to 4,271.78 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 335.36 points, or 2.55%, to 12,839.29.

For the week, the Dow dipped 1.9%, the S&P dropped 2.8%, and the Nasdaq declined 3.8%.

The prospect of a more hawkish Fed has led to a rocky start to the year for equities, with Friday's sell-off taking declines on both the S&P and Dow since the start of the year beyond 10%.

The trend is more pronounced in tech and growth shares whose valuations are more vulnerable to rising bond yields. The Nasdaq is down 17.9% in 2022.

Earnings are due next week for the four biggest U.S. companies by market capitalization: Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O).

The quartet declined between 2.4% and 4.1% on Friday. Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O), which also has results on deck for next week, dropped 2.1%, taking its losses in the last three days to 15.3%.

Investors are worried after streaming giant Netflix Inc's (NFLX.O) dismal earnings earlier this week sent shockwaves through big tech and stay-at-home darlings which benefited from pandemic factors such as lockdown measures.

The volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.66 billion shares, compared with the 11.67 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

WASHINGTON/LONDON, April 25 (Reuters) - European stocks slid to a one-month low and commodity prices dropped on Monday on renewed concerns about rising interest rates and China's sputtering economy, while Wall Street shares rose, reversing losses after Twitter agreed to be bought by billionaire Elon Musk.

Fears over China's COVID-19 outbreaks spooked investors already worried that higher U.S. interest rates could dent economic growth. U.S. shares were lower throughout most of the session, extending last week's sharp declines. The CBOE Volatility index (.VIX) known as Wall Street's fear gauge, hit the lowest level since mid-March.

Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), shares rose on news that Elon Musk, the world's richest person, clinked a deal to pay $44 billion cash for the social media platform populated by millions of users and global leaders. read more

After news of the deal, Wall Street reversed course on a late rally by growth stocks, and the Nasdaq ended sharply higher.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 0.7% to end at 34,049.46 points, while the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 0.57% to 4,296.12.

The Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) climbed 1.29% to 13,004.85.

""You can tell growth wanted to rally all day but the market was holding it down. The Twitter news came and that was just a green light to start buying some of the growth names. They have been oversold for a while,"" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Bright Trading LLC.

Earlier, Europe's STOXX 600 index (.STOXX) dropped 1.8% to close at its lowest since mid-March. Commodity stocks slumped 6%, as global worries overshadowed relief from French presidential results on Sunday which saw Emmanuel Macron edge past far-right challenger Marine Le Pen.

MSCI's benchmark for global equity markets (.MIWD00000PUS) fell 0.41% to 668.85. Emerging markets stocks (.MSCIEF) fell 2.61%. Overnight, Asian markets had their worst daily decline in over a month on fears Beijing would go back into a COVID-19 lockdown.

""Stocks' rebound from the first quarter correction has hit a wall of rising long-term interest rates,"" Morgan Stanley's Chief Investment Officer Lisa Shale said in a note.

""With the Fed talking about a faster and larger balance sheet reduction than anticipated, real yields are approaching zero from their deeply negative territory. With the nominal 10-year U.S. Treasury cracking 2.9%, the equity risk premium

has plummeted.""

The euro slid 0.9%, near the session's trough and its weakest level since the initial COVED panic of March 2020.

""The reality is there is more to the French election story than Macron's win yesterday,"" said Rabobank FX strategist Jane Foley.

France will hold parliamentary elections in June, and Macron also seems likely to maintain pressure for a Europe-wide ban on Russian oil and gas imports, which would cause near-term economic pain.

""We had German officials saying last week that if there was an immediate embargo of Russian energy then it would cause a recession in Germany. ... that would drag the rest of Europe down and have knock-on effects for the rest of the world,"" Foley said.

The dollar index rose 0.65% and climbed to a two-year high. It touched a peak of $1.0695 against the euro .

Investors wonder how fast and far the Federal Reserve will raise U.S. interest rates this year and whether that and other global strains will tip the world economy into recession.

This week will be packed with corporate earnings. Almost 180 S&P 500 index firms are to report. Among big U.S. tech companies, Microsoft and Google report on Tuesday, Facebook on Wednesday and Apple and Amazon on Thursday.

In Europe, 134 of the Stoxx 600 will put out results, including banks HSBC, UBS and Santander on Tuesday, Credit Suisse on Wednesday, Barclays on Thursday and NatWest and Spain's BBVA on Friday.

""I wonder whether just meeting expectations will be enough, it just feels like maybe we'll need a bit more,"" said Rob Carnell, ING's chief economist in Asia, referring to jitters about big tech following a dire report from Netflix last week.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng (.HSI) fell 3.7% and the Shanghai composite index (.SSEC) slid over 5% .

China's central bank had fixed the mid-point of the yuan's trading band at its lowest level in eight months, seen as an official nod for the currency's slide, and the yuan was sold further, to a one-year low of 6.5092 per dollar .

The higher dollar pushed spot gold 1.7% lower by 4:53 p.m. EST (2053 GMT). U.S. gold futures settled nearly 2% lower at $1,896. Palladium prices were down nearly 10% on worries over Chinese demand.

In oil, Brent crude closed 4% lower at $102.32 a barrel and U.S. crude settled down 3.5% at $98.54, its first close below $100 since April 11.

Euro zone bond yields fell.

Money markets are pricing in a 1 percentage point increase in U.S. interest rates at the Fed's next two meetings and at least 2.5 points for the year, which would be one of the biggest annual increases ever.

This week will also see the release of U.S. growth data, European inflation figures and a Bank of Japan policy meeting, which will be watched for any hints of a response to a sharp fall in the yen, which has lost 10% in about two months.

83,786,Microsoft,2022-04-25,Insights in Action: Addressing post-pandemic challenges – and some old perennials,"













Several law firm managing partners offered their insights on the issues confronting the legal industry — not surprisingly, talent concerns topped the list.

LONDON — While it will surprise no one that talent is the subject that is most on the minds of law firm leaders at the moment — and is increasingly a challenge with lawyers from associate to partner — the talent challenge is becoming a major issue for business services professionals as well.

At Thomson Reuters’ recent Insights Council dinner, 23 law firm managing partners from the US, Germany, Italy, South Africa, Canada, and the UK offered a truly global perspective on how the legal industry is confronting its talent issue and other ongoing challenges.

Everyone was quick to acknowledge the remarkable adaptations that had been made, force majeure, during the pandemic. Now, remote working with Zoom or Microsoft Teams has become the norm, and scarcely a beat has been missed in attending to clients’ needs. As we know, the initial fears of a business collapse during the darkest days of the pandemic was quickly replaced by the task of servicing something of a boom in legal work, especially in areas like M&A and labor & employment.

Indeed, the expectation within the legal industry is that this demand will likely continue for much of 2022 though perhaps with some tailing off in the M&A space, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Now, however, new challenges emerge, as the Council members discussed. Law firm leaders are convinced that there are losses emerging as a result of prolonged working from home, and that more junior staff have never absorbed the norms of team-working in person. More worrisome, these junior staffers are not naturally picking up the trade, and some firm leaders think this has made it necessary for firms to become more intentional about learning and development. Indeed, they feel that if you can’t rely on the water cooler encounter, then firms need to structure that same learning in other ways.

This intentional effort in career development means that the bygone time when lucky associates learned at the feet of a talented partner and the unlucky ones got the poor mentor needs to remain in the past. Today, firms have to ensure that learning and career opportunities benefit all legal staffers alike.

Offering learning and experience that goes beyond the law is seen as a vital component in staunching the hemorrhaging of young legal talent. Many associates are burnt out by working alone at home during unequaled periods of high activity. They don’t even get the fun party at the end of the transaction.

As a result, many firms are keen to encourage their people back into the office. What they are finding, however, is that groups respond quite differently. The younger attorneys, fed up with working with laptops on their beds, are keen to return. Yet, the more senior associates and some partners have enjoyed the reduced burden and cost of commuting and are markedly more resistant to returning.

<b>The in-house perspective</b>

All of these challenges were reflected back to firm leaders the morning after the dinner, when we invited three General Council to form a panel and discuss their expectations for their outside law firms. What emerged was that many of the same challenges in balancingtalen work and home seen by law firms apply to in-house teams too. Corporate law department leaders likewise tread a delicate balance on how much to encourage their people to be back in the office, though obviously, that works better for some roles than others. More interestingly, our GC panel observed that there are risks in an almost empty office — such as things not being noticed or conversations not being overhead that, prior to the pandemic, would have raised the alarm on something that then could have readily been handled early.

During these two sessions there were some interesting takes on technology as well. Everyone is profoundly grateful to have had Zoom and Teams, of course; yet now, lawyers are having to figure out how to manage hybrid meetings. Unfortunately, the consensus is that the technology is not good enough. People sit in meetings separately logged into Teams, often fussing over who is or is not muted and how much longer they can cope with screeching feedback.

The GCs also made a plea for better integration and collaboration around legal platforms. The pandemic has laid bare the frustrations of having to log into multiple firms’ systems in order to transact a deal.

Finally, the group explored whether the culture of sharing and collaboration has been the winner or loser of the past two years. Some felt that it’s been much harder to start new relationships virtually — and tougher to keep them going in between transactions. Savvy firms have invested more in advanced tech solutions to better equip their partners, but at the same time, this technology often is falling short. Unsurprisingly, not one firm was prepared to sing the praises of their CRM system.

Yet perhaps the greatest obstacles to robust function law firms still remain: Compensation systems that continue to favor individuality over team working, and many partners ultimately remaining quite insecure about introducing their younger colleagues to the client relationship.

These discussions gave us the chance to explore some significant new challenges that are currently confronting the legal industry, while allowing us plenty of time to acknowledge some old perennials that have demonstrated that they haven’t gone away.

April 25 (Reuters) - Videogame publisher Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) missed estimates for first-quarter adjusted sales on Monday, hurt by low demand for its latest title ""Call of Duty: Vanguard"".

Activision's performance has taken a hit from lower premium sales for ""Call of Duty: Vanguard"" and weaker engagement in ""Call of Duty: Warzone"", with a return to pre-pandemic habits pressing gamers to spend less time on their consoles.

The company, which is being taken over by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), has also been facing backlash over its response to allegations of internal sexual harassment and discrimination against female employees. read more

The Santa Monica, California-based company's quarterly adjusted sales stood at $1.48 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $1.80 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

Net income for the quarter ended March 31 fell to $395 million, or 50 cents per share, from $619 million, or 79 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding items, Activision earned 64 cents per share.

April 25 (Reuters) - Wall Street rose on Monday, with the Nasdaq ending sharply higher after Twitter agreed to be bought by billionaire Elon Musk, sparking a late day rally in growth stocks.

Twitter (TWTR.N) ended up 5.6% after announcing it would be bought by Musk in a deal that will shift control of the social media giant to the world's richest person. read more

The S&P 500 traded in negative territory for much of the session but extended gains after Twitter's announcement. The S&P 500 growth index (.IGX) ended up over 1%, also bouncing back from an earlier decline.

""You can tell growth wanted to rally all day but the market was holding it down. The Twitter news came and that was just a green light to start buying some of the growth names. They have been oversold for a while,"" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Bright Trading LLC.

Earlier, uncertainty reverberated across world markets, with Chinese shares marking their biggest slump since a pandemic-led selling in February 2020 and European stocks falling to their lowest in over a month on fears of strict restrictions in China.

The S&P energy index (.SPNY) dropped 3.3% as Brent crude prices dropped almost 5% toward $100 a barrel.

Oil majors Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and ExxonMobil (XOM.N) declined more than 2%, and oilfield services companies Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) and Halliburton Co (HAL.N) also fell more than 6%.

Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) rallied 2.9% ahead of its quarterly report after the bell on Tuesday. Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Facebook owner Meta Platforms (FB.O) also gained.

Nearly a third of S&P 500 index firms are due to report this week. Of the 102 companies in the S&P 500 that posted earnings so far, 77.5% reported above analysts' expectations, according to Refinitiv data.

""Earnings are going to be crucial to the mindset of the of the average investor. The playbook was buy Apple, buy Netflix, buy Google and throw away the key, but that playbook is no longer working,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer at Longbow Asset Management. ""What is the outlook for these companies going to be?""

86,342,Microsoft,2022-04-25,British Land sells majority stake in Paddington Central assets to GIC for $886 mln,"













April 25 (Reuters) - British Land (BLND.L) said on Monday it had sold 75% stake in its Paddington Central assets to Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC for 694 million pounds ($885.9 million), with the UK-based landlord looking to invest in high-growth warehousing properties.

Commercial landlords have struggled over the past two years as multiple COVID lockdowns and an extended moratorium on rent collection has hurt retail-focused assets, while a shift to remote working has weighed on office portfolios.

Paddington Central in London is a mixed-used campus with predominantly office spaces as well as some retail and leisure properties, housing companies such as Microsoft (MSFT.O), Visa (V.N) and Prudential (PRU.L).

The sale consideration was 1% below the September 2021 book value of the assets and represents a net initial yield, a key ratio in real estate transactions, of 4.5%.

""Proceeds from the transaction will be invested into value accretive development opportunities we own across our portfolio as well as growth areas including development-led urban logistics in London and innovation campuses,"" British Land said in a statement.

Warehousing or logistics business now looks a safer bet for commercial property firms, thanks to increasing demand from rapid delivery ecommerce companies, which require small urban fulfilment centres.

The deal has created a joint venture with GIC owning 75% of the combined assets and British Land, whose shares slipped about 1.8% in morning trade, holding the rest.

British Land said two properties within the Paddington Central campus, The Novotel at 3 Kingdom Street and the development site at 5 Kingdom Street, currently remain outside the joint venture.

87,360,Microsoft,2022-04-26,BT and Toshiba trial first commercial quantum-secured network,"













LONDON, April 27 (Reuters) - Britain's BT (BT.L) and Japan's Toshiba (6502.T) on Wednesday launched the first commercial trial of a quantum-secured network that will block vulnerabilities in encryption that will emerge when quantum computing becomes mainstream.

Professional services group EY will use the network to connect two of its sites in London, one at London Bridge and the other at Canary Wharf, the companies said.

Quantum computers are unreliable and costly today but the technology, which is being developed by companies including Google, IBM and Microsoft, offers the potential to crunch data millions of times faster than supercomputers.

Rather than storing information in bits - or zeros and ones - quantum computing makes use of a property of sub-atomic particles in which they can exist simultaneously in different states. They can then become 'entangled' - meaning they can influence each other's behaviour in an observable way - leading to exponential increases in computing power.

BT's Chief Technology Officer Howard Watson said quantum technology could potentially be used to break current encryption keys while data is being transmitted.

Quantum key distribution (QKD), however, uses photonics to transmit the encryption key in fibre networks, he said. If the QKD is hacked in transmission, its state is changed and therefore the attack will be detected in real time.

He said BT and Toshiba, with EY as their first trial customer, were ""paving the way for further commercial explorations for quantum technologies"".

BT will provide the end-to-end encrypted links over its Openreach private fibre networks, while Toshiba is providing the QKD hardware and key management software, the companies said.

88,433,Microsoft,2022-04-26,Coding platform SonarSource valued at $4.7 bln after latest funding,"













April 26 (Reuters) - SonarSource, a coding platform for developers, said on Tuesday it was valued at $4.7 billion after raising $412 million in capital in a new funding round led by Advent International and General Catalyst.

Geneva-based SonarSource intends to use the funds to double its salesforce this year and expand the company's marketing team across its international offices including those in the United States, France, Germany and Switzerland.

Olivier Gaudin, co-founder and chief executive officer, said the company is also preparing for public markets.

The company, whose customers include technology giants IBM (IBM.N), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O), offers a platform that supports 29 programming languages, allowing developers to ""write clean code"". Its product offerings include both open-source and commercial solutions.

Technology firms offering innovative solutions for enterprises to streamline their business operations have seen valuations jump, with several using pandemic-fueled growth to float their shares in the public markets or raising funds in new rounds.

Enterprise software firms like coding platform GitLab Inc (GTLB.O), Hashicorp Inc (HCP.O) and Freshworks Inc (FRSH.O) all made strong market debuts last year, fetching valuations of more than $10 billion each.

Even as high-growth tech valuations have come under pressure this year, several firms continue to see interest from prominent venture capital and private equity giants.

Commenting on the importance of clean coding, Gaudin told Reuters, ""organizations invest in this practice because they see the high return on investment, both on developers' productivity and software risk management.""

SonarSource is also looking to expand in the Asia-Pacific market and said it would open a regional headquarters in Singapore.

Other investors in the new fundraise include private equity firms Permira and existing investor Insight Partners.

April 26 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply lower on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq closing at its lowest since December 2020 as investors worried about slowing global growth and a more aggressive Federal Reserve.

Tesla (TSLA.O) slumped 12% after investors worried that chief executive Elon Musk might sell some of his stake in the electric car maker to help pay for his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter, announced on Monday. read more

Tesla contributed more than any other stock to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq's steep declines.

It was the steepest one-day drop for the Nasdaq since September 2020. The tech-heavy index has now fallen 22% from its record high close last November.

Previously-prized growth stocks have been hammered in recent weeks as investors fret about the impact of higher interest rates on their future earnings.

China's COVID-19 led lockdown and an aggressive pivot by major central banks to fight inflation have overshadowed what has been a better-than-expected quarterly earnings season so far.

Apple (AAPL.O), Wall Street's most valuable company, fell 3.7% in Tuesday's session ahead of its report on Thursday.

""Earnings broadly have been pretty good. But it hasn't really mattered very much to the overall stock story. It's mainly about the Fed and other central banks, and now China and COVID,"" said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky.

""I think with where the market is right now, in this indiscriminate selling and fear phase, I think you've got more potential for downside risk than you have for an upside surprise,"" Mayfield said.

The S&P 500 consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) index lost 4.99% and was among the worst of 11 sector indexes, pulled lower by Tesla, and also by a 4.6% decline in Amazon (AMZN.O).

WASHINGTON/MILAN, April 26 (Reuters) - U.S. shares tumbled on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq posting its steepest one-day rout since September 2020, while European stocks extended losses for a third session as investors warily awaited U.S. tech earnings and fretted over global growth.

China's COVID-19 curbs and fears of aggressive U.S. Federal Reserve tightening continued to damp risk appetite and lifted the dollar to new two-year highs.

Oil prices rebounded in volatile trading and gold prices rose on safe-haven buying.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq led Wall Street lower, closing at its lowest since late 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 2.38% to end at 33,240.18 points, while the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 2.81% to 4,175.2.

Investors also eyed the Federal Reserve meeting next week. Markets have been fretting that an aggressive pace of tightening by the Fed could derail the global economy, which has only just started to recover from the pandemic.

The Fed is expected to raise rates by a half a percentage point at each of its next two meetings. FEDWATCH

""It is unrealistic to think that the U.S. can raise interest rates in this way without looking at the real economy,"" said Carlo Franchini, head of institutional clients at Banca Ifigest, adding he was also worried about hawkish signals in Europe.

The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell to 2.73%.

Germany's 10-year yields , the benchmark of the euro bloc, also fell, trading at 0.802%, after falling more than 11 basis points the day before.

In currency markets, the dollar rose 0.63% against a basket of rivals to a fresh two-year high.

China's offshore yuan fell against the dollar, but stayed above Monday's year-low of 6.6090 after the People's Bank of China said it would cut the amount of foreign exchange banks must hold as reserves.

Oil prices rebounded on China's plans to support its economy. Brent crude futures settled up $2.67, or 2.6%, at $104.99 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate contracts were up $3.16, or 3.2%, at $101.70.

April 26 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Tuesday forecast double-digit revenue growth for the next fiscal year, driven by demand for cloud computing services, and its shares jumped about 4%.

Microsoft forecast Intelligent Cloud revenue of $21.1 billion to $21.35 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter, driven by strong growth in its Azure platform. That compared with a Wall Street consensus of $20.933 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

""If there is any macro headwind, where you have more value for less price means you win. In our case, when it comes to our commercial cloud offerings, we have significant advantages on that across the stack,"" Microsoft's chief executive, Satya Nadella, said when asked how the company was projecting double-digit growth for the next fiscal year.

TECHnalysis Research chief analyst Bob O'Donnell noted Microsoft's ability to buck industry trends.

“Despite current gloom and doom around big tech, Microsoft’s strong revenues and robust forecast highlight that not all tech is at risk,"" O'Donnell said. ""For companies that focus on delivering products and services that businesses need to modernize their operations ... there’s still plenty of upside.”

Microsoft on Tuesday reported profit and revenue for its fiscal third quarter that beat Wall Street expectations, also benefiting from demand for its cloud-based services.

Microsoft results indicate that it can keep its pandemic-fueled sales growing as economies reopen and businesses shift to a hybrid model of allowing staff to alternatively work from office and home.

That trend is also helping drive up revenue of Windows products, said Brett Iversen, Microsoft's general manager of investor relations. ""Strength in the commercial PC market drove Windows OEM revenue up 11%,"" he told Reuters.

Third-quarter Azure annual growth of 46.0% was steady from the previous quarter and in line with estimates of 45.6% growth compiled by Visible Alpha. Still, Azure growth has showed a steady drop from fiscal 2020 when it was in the 60% range.

In contrast, Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) on Tuesday reported that Google Cloud's growth rate in the first quarter fell slightly to 43.8%, from 44.6% in the 2021 fourth quarter. Alphabet's first-quarter revenue came in below expectations, and its shares were down 2% in after-hours trading.

Microsoft's Nadella said the number of $100 million-plus Azure deals more than doubled year-over-year in the third quarter.

""These numbers show that customers continue to turn to Microsoft as they accelerate their shift to cloud computing and the current unsettling economic environment has not yet impacted the company's main growth driver,"" said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com.

Still, Microsoft chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said the company's business could be impacted if China's shutdown over the pandemic extends into May, although the current impact of the shutdowns is already reflected in Microsoft's outlook.

""However, extended production shutdowns that reach into May would further negatively impact our outlook across Windows OEM, surface, and Xbox hardware,"" she told investors.

The company reported revenue of $49.36 billion in the third quarter, compared with $41.7 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $49.05 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

Net income rose to $16.73 billion, or $2.22 per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $15.46 billion, or $2.03 per share, a year earlier. That topped analyst targets of $2.19.

The pan-Europe STOXX 600 index (.STOXX) closed lower, with technology stocks (.SX8P) down 2.3% at six-week lows and banks (.SX7P) dropping 2.3%.

The index had rallied up to 1% earlier in the day, cheered by strong earnings from companies including Swiss bank UBS (UBSG.S) and shipping giant Maersk (MAERSKb.CO). This followed a 2% plunge on Monday on worries of an economic slowdown in China and rapid U.S. interest rate hikes. read more

""Investors are back to fretting about economic growth, returning to the theme that dominated at the end of last week,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG.

""Meanwhile... nerves about big tech earnings this week have come to the fore.""

The tech-heavy Nasdaq slumped more than 2%, with Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) falling more than 2% each ahead of their results after the closing bell.

Capping broader losses in Europe, miners (.SXPP) rose 1.1% recovering a sliver of Monday's 6% plunge, while energy stocks (.SXEP) gained 0.9%.

This kept the FTSE 100 (.FTSE) buoyed amid a continued rout for Germany's DAX (.GDAXI) and Spain's IBEX (.IBEX) which lost more than 1%.

At the bottom of the STOXX 600 was Swedish medical equipment maker Getinge (GETIb.ST) which plunged 15.2% after reporting a larger-than-expected drop in quarterly profit.

Shares in French car parts supplier Faurecia (EPED.PA) slid 10.7%, dragging down the auto index (.SXAP), with analysts pointing to worse-than-expected guidance issued by Forvia, the group born from its takeover of German rival Hella (HLE.DE). Faurecia also said it plans to review its activities.

Meanwhile, investor focus was on the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting next week and comments from European Central Bank officials. The ECB should raise rates soon and has room for up to three hikes this year, ECB policymaker Martins Kazaks told Reuters. read more

A look at the day ahead in markets from Dhara Ranasinghe.

Billionaire Elon Musk's $44 billion cash deal to buy Twitter (TWTR.N) lit a fire under tech stocks, and broader equity markets, stalling a selloff that had threatened to take hold.

Asian stocks rallied, taking their cue from Wall Street, and European shares are tipped to open over 1% higher.

Yet the headwinds that grabbed market attention on Monday have not gone away and will continue to test the bounceback.

Let's start with Russia. Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday warned the world not to underestimate the considerable risks of nuclear conflict. read more

Then, central banks. The European Central Bank's Martins Kazaks joined a chorus of policymakers calling for a swift exit from stimulus, suggesting the ECB should raise rates soon and has room for up to three hikes this year. read more

Finally, China. Three-quarters of Beijing's 22 million people lined up for COVID-19 tests on Tuesday, as authorities in the Chinese capital raced to stamp out an outbreak.

Fears of the kind of city-wide lockdown that has shrouded Shanghai for a month are raising concerns for the world's second-biggest economy. Any slowdown will no doubt ripple out more widely.

Such worries have pummelled the yuan, pushing it 3.5% lower this month. It got minimal marginal respite from the central bank's pledge on Monday to cut the amount of foreign exchange banks must hold as reserves.

The session ahead will be dominated by earnings. In the European banking landscape, HSBC stood out with a 27% Q1 profit drop which contrasted with the resilience displayed by UBS and Santander read more .

95,9,Microsoft,2022-04-27,Microsoft discloses onslaught of Russian cyberattacks on Ukraine,"













April 27 (Reuters) - Russian government hackers carried out multiple cyber operations against Ukraine that appeared to support Moscow's military attacks and online propaganda campaigns, Microsoft (MSFT.O) said in a report on Wednesday.

The reported intrusions - some of which have not been previously disclosed - suggest that hacking has played a bigger role in the conflict than what has been publicly known.

The digital onslaught, which Microsoft said began one year prior to Russia's Feb. 24 invasion, may have laid the groundwork for different military missions in the war-torn territory, researchers found.

Between Feb. 23 and April 8, Microsoft said, it observed a total of 37 Russian destructive cyberattacks inside Ukraine.

The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

The findings underscore how modern warfare can combine digital and kinetic strikes, experts said.

""Russian generals and spies have tried to make cyberattacks part of their war effort while they've struggled on the battlefield,"" said Thomas Rid, a professor of Strategic Studies at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.

Microsoft said Russia's hacking and military operations worked in ""tandem against a shared target set."" The tech company said it could not determine whether this correlation was driven by coordinated decision-making or simply because of shared goals.

For example, a timeline published by Microsoft showed that on March 1 – the same day a Russian missile was fired at Kyiv's TV tower – media companies in the capital were hit by destructive hacks and cyberespionage.

In another case, the company's cybersecurity research team recorded ""suspected Russian actors"" lurking on Ukrainian critical infrastructure in the northeast city of Sumy, two weeks before widespread electricity shortages were reported in the area on March 3.

The next day, Microsoft said, Russian hackers broke into a government network in the central Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia. Two days later, missiles leveled the city's airport.

Victor Zhora, a top Ukrainian cybersecurity official, said on Wednesday that he continues to see Russian cyberattacks on local telecom companies and energy grid operators.

""I believe that they can organize more attacks on these sectors,"" Zhora told reporters. ""We shouldn't underestimate Russian hackers but we probably should not over-estimate their potential.""

He thanked Microsoft, the U.S. government and multiple European allies for their cybersecurity support.

Since the start of the war, academics and analysts have said Russia appeared to be less active in the cyber domain against Ukraine than expected. The Microsoft report reveals a flurry of malicious cyber activity, although its impact in most cases has been either unclear or not immediately evident.

Two weeks ago the U.S. government publicly exposed a cyberweapon, known as Pipedream, that was designed to damage industrial control systems. While the tool hasn't been attributed to Russia, it is viewed as highly dangerous and its discovery coincides with the Ukraine conflict.

Euro plunges on growth and Ukraine fears

Dollar eyes biggest monthly gain since 2015

http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh















WASHINGTON/LONDON, April 27 (Reuters) - Key U.S. equity indexes ended higher after choppy trade on Wednesday on a boost from strong earnings from Microsoft and Visa, as commodity stocks lifted European shares to their first gain in four sessions.

The euro dropped to its weakest since 2017 after Russia halted gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland, and investors fretted more about the region's economy.

The dollar continued its surge, on course for its biggest monthly gain since January 2015 as expectations mounted that the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike interest rates aggressively in coming months and the American economy will be stronger than the euro zone.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 0.19% to end at 33,301.93 points, while the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 0.21% to 4,183.92.

The Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 0.01% to 12,488.93.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) jumped 4.8% % and Visa Inc (V.N) surged 6.5%% on strong earnings, helping boost the S&P 500.

The pan-European STOXX 600 (.STOXX) rose 0.7% after having hit six-week lows at the open, with miners (.SXPP) and oil stocks (.SXEP) both gaining.

German shares (.GDAXI), which underperformed through the session, rallied at the close.

European corporate earnings were mixed. Credit Suisse reported another quarterly loss and Deutsche Bank warned the Russia-Ukraine conflict could hurt annual earnings. read more

Russia cut the flow of natural gas to Bulgaria and Poland for rejecting its demand to pay in roubles, taking direct aim at European economies. This led investors to sell euros and snap up U.S. dollars. read more

MSCI's benchmark for global equity markets (.MIWD00000PUS) retreated 0.17%. Emerging markets stocks (.MSCIEF) fell 0.54%.

U.S. Treasury yields rose, as investors awaited greater clarity on the ""restrictive"" policy the Fed plans to pursue next week to combat inflation by curbing economic growth.

The euro dropped as low as $1.0512 , its weakest against the dollar since May 2017. Analysts cited the war in Ukraine and growing concerns that the bloc's economy will fall into recession this year.

""The euro's blatant inability to rally on hawkish comments by European Central Bank members means lingering vulnerability to an external environment negatively affected by an ever-concerning situation in Ukraine and generalized USD strength,"" ING FX strategists wrote in a note to clients.

The dollar index measuring the greenback against a basket of rivals, hit a five-year high.

""The U.S. dollar benefits from the prospect of an ongoing flight to safety liquidity bid,"" said Jeremy Stretch, head of G10 FX strategy at CIBC.

CHINESE REBOUND

There was more selling in Asia, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) down 0.82% after hitting its lowest since mid-March. Tokyo's Nikkei (.N225) fell 1.17%.

Australian shares (.AXJO) lost 0.78% as inflation hit a 20-year high, bringing interest rate rises closer. read more

Spot gold prices hit a more than two-month low and were last down 1.05% by 4:34 p.m. EST (2034 GMT), under pressure from the dollar's rally. U.S. gold futures GCv1 settled down 0.8% at $1,888.70 per ounce.

NEW YORK, April 27 (Reuters) - A mixed bag of earnings from some of Wall Street’s biggest companies may muddy the outlook for investors hoping to ""buy the dip"" amid a vicious stock market selloff.

With a massive week of corporate results under way, Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) reported first-quarter revenue below expectations on Tuesday, while software giant Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) forecast double-digit revenue growth for its next fiscal year. read more

Investors have focused on results from some of Wall Street’s biggest names this week, hoping they could provide a counterweight to the deluge of news that has battered stocks in recent days, highlighted by concerns over an increasingly hawkish Federal Reserve to worries over geopolitical turbulence stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. read more

Though most of the earnings season lies ahead, some investors worry that anything less than stellar results from corporate behemoths will do little to stem a slide in stocks that left the S&P 500 down 12.4% on the year after Tuesday’s 2.8% drop. The Nasdaq on Tuesday hit its lowest closing level since December 2020 as it lost nearly 4%, bringing it 22% below the all-time high it hit less than six months ago, on Nov. 19. read more

S&P 500 futures pared earlier gains on Wednesday morning and were recently up around 0.3%.

""There's a lot of anxiety ahead of the earnings ... because if they don't hold up, then there's nothing left to hold up the market,"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital in New York.

Despite the mixed results from big growth names, earnings in the broad S&P 500 have topped analyst expectations. Overall, about 81% of companies have exceeded earnings expectations, with first-quarter profits now expected to have climbed 8.2% from the year-ago period, up from an estimated 6.4% at the start of April, according to Refinitiv data as of Tuesday morning.

Yet there have been some high-profile disappointments, including growth-stock poster child Netflix (NFLX.O), whose shares were pummeled after its results.

“Expectations for growth (companies) are very, very high, and you don’t meet expectations and you are going to see the Netflix or the Google drops,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago. “It's not industry specific, it’s more company specific.”

Microsoft’s shares were up about 3.5% in pre-market trading on Wednesday, while Alphabet’s were off about 4.6%.

In another setback for growth stocks, Tesla (TSLA.O) shares tumbled 12% on Tuesday after the electric carmaker's CEO, Elon Musk, clinched his deal to buy Twitter (TWTR.N) for $44 billion.

But on the upbeat side, shares of Visa (V.N) rose in after-hours trade on Tuesday after the payments company said it expects revenue to accelerate past pre-pandemic levels. read more

Markets could get fresh jolts this week as other results flow in, including from Apple (AAPL.O)and Amazon.com (AMZN.O). Facebook owner Meta Platforms is scheduled to report after the close on Wednesday (FB.O).

With only a few days left in the month, the S&P 500 is down 7.8% for April so far, which would be its biggest monthly percentage drop since March 2020.

Even so, there may be some reason for optimism in April's final days. According to Bespoke Investment Group, in 39 prior months since 1980 where the S&P 500 was down at least 5% with three trading days left, the S&P averaged a gain of 1.51% in the final three trading days of these months.

""Usually, the final three trading days of these bad months offer up some relief for investors,"" Bespoke said in a note.

Summary Law firms Christian Ahlborn served as global head of antitrust at Linklaters

Rival firms hiring antitrust lawyers as EU prepares new regulatory push















Christian Ahlborn, former global head of antitrust at Linklaters, is leaving this summer to join Covington & Burling's Brussels office as a partner, as large law firms gear up to advise clients on new EU rules governing competitive digital markets.

London-based Ahlborn had co-led Linklaters' technology sector team, and has worked at the firm for nearly 30 years. He has helped to guide Linklaters clients including Microsoft Corp, Unilever Plc and Lloyds Banking Group Plc.

Ahlborn did not immediately return a request for comment on Friday.

Last month, EU countries and lawmakers reached a deal on landmark rules that could curb the power of major technology companies. The Digital Markets Act's digital ""gatekeeper"" rules are designed to prohibit companies from favoring their own services over those of rivals.

EU antitrust leaders are also preparing to consider new ways to streamline existing competition rules that have imposed billions of euros in fines against technology companies.

Johan Ysewyn, co-chair of Covington's global antitrust practice, said there's a demand now for antitrust and competition lawyers. He attributed some of the hiring to a growing need for compliance advice, more investigations in the digital sector and increasingly labor-intensive legal work.

""The merger and competition investigations have become more data-intensive and document-driven, which of course requires larger teams,"" he said.

Another former Linklaters antitrust leader, Jonas Koponen, jumped in March to Cooley's office in Brussels, where the EU's competition office is headquartered. In March, Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton added former Linklaters antitrust partner Isabel Rooms in Brussels.

Thomas Barnett and Anne Lee, co-chairs of Covington's global antitrust practice, said in a statement Ahlborn's arrival at the Washington, D.C.-based, 1,100-lawyer firm will expand its ability to ""guide clients through their most complex antitrust issues that require deep expertise on both sides of the Atlantic.""

Linklaters has nearly 2,900 lawyers working from more than 30 offices across the globe. The firm wished Ahlborn the best in a statement Friday.

The firm said Ahlborn stepped down from his antitrust role in October.

Linklaters appointed Nicole Kar in March as global head of its antitrust and foreign investment team, which is made up of more than 50 partners and counsel.

(This article updates the timing of when Christian Ahlborn stepped down as Linklaters’ global antitrust head).

April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. equity funds witnessed a third weekly outflow in the week to April 27 as investors worried about slowing global growth and a more aggressive Federal Reserve.

According to Refinitiv Lipper data, U.S. investors exited equity funds worth a net $10.55 billion, which was a 34% lower weekly outflow, compared with the previous week.

Fund flows: US equities bonds and money market funds

However, better-than-estimated earnings results from some mega cap U.S. companies including Microsoft Corp , Visa Inc (V.N) and Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) eased some concerns and capped outflows. read more

U.S. large-cap equity funds drew their first weekly inflow in three weeks, worth $698 million, but mid- and small-cap focused funds posted $1.67 billion and $1.74 billion, respectively, in outflows.

U.S. growth funds faced massive outflows for a third consecutive week, amounting $5.13 billion, while value funds had about $2 billion worth of net outgo.

Fund flows: US growth and value funds

Fund flows: US equity sector funds

U.S. money market funds drew inflows of $43.11 billion in the biggest weekly net buying since March 2.

Meanwhile, U.S. bond funds saw outflows easing to a three-week low of $4.53 billion.

U.S. municipal bond funds had net selling of $3.08 billion and taxable bond funds had outflows of $1.09 billion.

U.S. short/intermediate investment-grade funds posted outflows for a 16th week, worth $3.14 billion, although general domestic taxable fixed income funds and loan participation funds attracted $1.15 billion and $0.59 billion, respectively, in net buying.

Inflation-protected funds saw first weekly outflow in nine weeks, worth $319 million.

Tech names stage late-afternoon rally

Indexes gain: Dow 0.26%, S&P 0.57%, Nasdaq 1.63%















May 2 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes closed a seesaw session higher on Monday, as investors bought in to technology names in the last hour of trading amid bets they had been overly beaten down ahead of this week's Federal Reserve meeting.

The gathering of U.S. central bank policymakers is widely expected to raise interest rates by half a percentage point, with this week's move expected to kick off a period of aggressive rate hikes to counter inflation.

Nervousness heading into the meeting was reflected in a topsy-turvy session for U.S. equities. After positive moves to start the day, the S&P 500 fell to its lowest intraday point since May 2021, and the Nasdaq touched a level last seen in November 2020.

The jitters were also seen in the market for U.S. Treasuries, where the ten-year benchmark breached 3% for the first time in more than three years.

As well as positioning themselves for the expected rate hike, traders were also looking to the launch of ""quantitative tightening,"" where the central bank reduces its balance sheet after buying bonds to support the economy during the pandemic. read more

However, earlier declines were used as a buying opportunity by some in the latter part of the session to drag all three indexes into positive territory.

""We're at a point in the market now where so much of it, across various sectors, is beaten down,"" said Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer of Defiance ETF.

""I think the market has priced in what the Fed will be able to do, so my sense - as someone who likes to look for long-term opportunities - is that this is the land of opportunity right now.""

Jablonski pointed to megacap technology names, which stand to remain key parts of the economy for years to come, as being ""on sale"".

High-growth stocks such as tech have been pummeled this year as a result of traders adjusting for the higher interest-rate environment, with losses accentuated in recent days by a number of disappointing earnings reports.

102,681,Microsoft,2022-05-02,Uneven earnings season providing little fuel for volatile U.S. stock market,"













NEW YORK, May 2 (Reuters) - Mixed financial results from U.S. megacap companies are dampening an otherwise better-than-expected first-quarter earnings season and so far failing to fuel stock performance in the face of U.S. Federal Reserve monetary tightening.

A busy week of earnings that saw big swings in the equity market was capped off on Friday by a disappointing report from Amazon (AMZN.O), whose shares tumbled 14% and dragged the S&P 500 down 3.6% on the day. The e-commerce giant delivered a disappointing quarter and outlook, swamped by higher costs to run its warehouses and deliver packages to customers. read more

""The reports from Q1 have for the most part come in better than expected although some megacaps have disappointed, and I think those disappointments have acted as an overhang to the market,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut.

The S&P 500 ended with its fourth straight weekly decline that has pulled the benchmark index down 13.3% in the first four months of the year.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq (.IXIC) fell 13.3% in April alone, its biggest monthly drop since October 2008 in the midst of the financial crisis.

Concerns over surging inflation and how aggressively the Fed plans to act to rein it in along with geopolitical worries such as the war in Ukraine and lockdowns in China continue to hang over the market, investors said.

""Those are the predominant themes, and earnings are not strong enough to overcome those other themes,"" Pavlik said.

With 275 companies reported, S&P 500 earnings were on track to have climbed 10.1% in the first quarter from the year-earlier period, up from an expectation of a 6.4% increase at the start of April, according to Refinitiv data as of Friday.

So far, 80.4% of companies have reported earnings above analysts estimates. That beat rate is above 66% for a typical quarter since 1994, but just below the 83% rate of the past four quarters, according to Refinitiv.

""I would not call it a great earnings season or a horrible one,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. ""It's pretty mediocre.""

Among the standouts so far this period, Meta Platforms (FB.O) shares soared 17.6% on Thursday after the social media company surprised Wall Street with a better-than-expected rise in users joining the platform. read more

Other major stocks have not fared as well. Aside from Amazon, shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) slid on Wednesday after its report, while Netlfix (NFLX.O) shares tumbled earlier in the month after its results.

Overall, top megacap growth companies - Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft , Alphabet, Amazon and Meta - combined reported an earnings per share decline of 1.2%, according to Credit Suisse equity strategists Jonathan Golub and Manish Bangard.

That compares to a gain of 12.4% for all other S&P 500 companies, including a combination of already reported results and estimates for yet-to-be released first-quarter results, the Credit Suisse strategists said in a note.

Those big five companies also posted a lower aggregate earnings beat, of 2.3% versus 8.6% for all other companies that reported results so far as of Thursday, according to Credit Suisse.

Those five stocks ""delivered disappointing results this week,"" the bank's strategists wrote.

While many of the largest companies already have reported, nearly half the members of the S&P 500 still are on tap. Pfizer (PFE.N), Starbucks (SBUX.O) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) are among the reports due this week.

103,383,Microsoft,2022-05-02,EU's Vestager assessing if tech giants should share telecoms network costs,"













BRUSSELS, May 2 (Reuters) - Tech giants such as Google (GOOGL.O), Meta (FB.O) and Netflix (NFLX.O) may have to bear some of the cost of Europe's telecoms network, Europe's digital chief Margrethe Vestager said on Monday, following EU telecoms operators' complaints.

""I think there is an issue that we need to consider with a lot of focus, and that is the issue of fair contribution to telecommunication networks,"" Vestager told a news conference.

""Because we see that there are players who generate a lot of traffic that then enables their business but who have not been contributing actually to enable that traffic. They have not been contributing to enabling the investments in the rollout of connectivity,"" she said.

""And we are in the process of getting a thorough understanding of how could that be enabled,"" Vestager said, adding that she was looking into how data traffic evolves over time and that related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to a study released by telecoms lobbying group ETNO on Monday, Meta, Alphabet, Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Netflix accounted for over 56% of all global data traffic last year.

The study said an annual contribution of 20 billion euros ($21 billion) to network costs by the tech giants could give a 72-billion-euro boost to the EU economy. ETNO's members include Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) and Orange (ORAN.PA).

Vestager, however, gave short shrift to the telecoms industry's calls to loosen EU merger rules to allow more consolidation.

""The problem is that the arguments that we hear, like the need for scale in order to invest, they are not new,"" she said.

104,161,Microsoft,2022-05-02,Activision shares rise after Buffett reveals Berkshire's 9.5% stake,"













May 2 (Reuters) - Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) shares rose on Monday after Warren Buffett said his company Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) had taken a 9.5% stake in the video game maker, which Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has agreed to buy for $68.7 billion.

Buffett revealed the approximately $5.6 billion investment in Activision on Saturday at Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. He said he may increase the stake above 10%. read more

Activision shares were up $2.13, or 2.8%, at $77.73 in afternoon trading, after earlier rising to $78.22. They remain far below the $95 per share that Microsoft offered on Jan. 18.

The merger would combine Activision, whose franchises include ""Call of Duty"" and ""Candy Crush,"" with Microsoft's Xbox, which makes gaming consoles and whose franchises include ""Halo.""

Buffett appears to believe Activision's share price is low because investors are overly pessimistic about whether U.S. and European Union regulators will approve the merger. read more

One of Buffett's portfolio managers had built a $1.1 billion stake in Activision late last year, but Buffett said the subsequent bet was his. read more

""We want to be very clear that it was Warren Buffett's decision, ... and he doesn't know what the Justice Department is going to do, he doesn't know what the EU is going to do,"" Buffett said. ""One thing we do know is Microsoft has the money.""

Microsoft and Activision did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Berkshire has been on a spending spree, having bought $51.1 billion of stocks including Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N), and even adding to its huge stake in Apple Inc (AAPL.O), in the first quarter.

The Activision investment could generate about $1 billion of profit for Berkshire, depending on what it paid.

Buffett said he ""seldom"" makes such investments, a form of arbitrage, because ""they've got to be big"" to make sense for his $712 billion company.

""When he's looking at investments, he always looking at odds, and they have to be distinctly in his favor or he won't be interested,"" said Paul Lountzis, president of Lountzis Asset Management LLC, a longtime Berkshire investor.

""Even though he's spent $51 billion on equities, it's a good way to deploy additional capital,"" he added.

Buffett said he made similar, smaller investments recently.

He bought Red Hat Inc shares after IBM Corp (IBM.N) agreed in 2018 to buy the software company for $34.8 billion, and he bought Monsanto Co shares after Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE) agreed in 2016 to buy the maker of Roundup weed killer for $63 billion.

Berkshire ""got very lucky because it turned out to be a terrible acquisition for Bayer,"" Buffett said.

BERLIN, May 4 (Reuters) - EU antitrust rules should be beefed up to allow regulators to break up companies for serious breaches, German State Secretary Sven Giegold said on Wednesday, urging EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager to consider this when reforming regulations.

Rules known as Regulation 1/2003, in force since 2004, have allowed Vestager to go after Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta (FB.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Intel (INTC.O), and impose billions of euros in fines.

Vestager's proposal to reform the rules came as companies complained about lengthy proceedings and demands for information ranging from minutiae to complex data. read more

Giegold, state secretary at the German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, said Vestager should be bolder.

""Market investigations and structural remedies should also be on the table for the upcoming review of the regulation 1/2003 that Vice President Margaret Vestager has announced recently,"" he told a conference organised by the German cartel office.

Giegold said European Union merger rules could also do with an update to strengthen them, in particular against big companies acquiring smaller rivals to close them down.

""One particular area where we need reinforcement is EU merger control. The number of interventions in mergers has dropped over the years,"" he said.

""Unfortunately, and to some extent incomprehensibly the European mission so far has resisted calls to look into the EU merger regulation and the underlying substantive guidelines to better deal with killer acquisitions. We need reform here,"" Giegold said.

Giegold said the German government planned to give more powers to the country's cartel office.

""We will look into giving more flexibility to the Bundeskartellamt in this regard in regard with its market internal investigations when reforming our national competition law,"" he said.

106,155,Microsoft,2022-05-05,"'Fortnite' returns to iOS, Android devices via Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming","













May 5 (Reuters) - Users of Xbox Cloud Gaming will now be able to play ""Fortnite"" for free on devices powered by Google-owned Android and Apple's iOS thanks to a partnership between Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Epic Games, the companies said on Thursday.

The hit battle-royal videogame has been out of the reach of mobile users since Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Google removed it from their app stores in 2020 over a tussle about in-app payment guidelines.

The Microsoft partnership would allow users including PC gamers to stream ""Fortnite"" on internet browsers on their devices just like Netflix irrespective of the hardware specifications.

The move is likely to help Microsoft attract more casual gamers as the software giant doubles down on efforts to bolster its presence in the videogaming market and take on rival Sony Corp (6758.T). The company earlier this year unveiled a $68.7 billion takeover of ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O).

""Fortnite"" is the first free-to-play title to join the Xbox Cloud Gaming service. ""It's an important step to add a Free-to-Play title to the cloud gaming catalog as we continue our cloud journey,"" Microsoft said in a blog post.

Since launching in 2020, more than 10 million people around the world have streamed games through Xbox Cloud Gaming. The service is available in 26 markets, including the United States.

Microsoft, as well as Epic Games and scores of other firms, have criticized Apple's store practices, which require developers to pay commissions of up to 30% for purchases made in the store.

The ""Fortnite"" creator has also been involved in a legal battle with Apple, but it largely lost a trial last year over whether Apple's payment rules for apps were anticompetitive.

That decision found Apple had suitable reasons to force some app makers to use its payment system and take commissions of 15% to 30% on their sales.

107,397,Microsoft,2022-05-05,Fidelity heir's wife turns to famed litigator for divorce,"













BOSTON, May 5 (Reuters) - The wife of Edward C. Johnson IV, whose family controls mutual fund powerhouse Fidelity Investments, has hired celebrity lawyer David Boies to represent her in a high-stakes divorce trial that opens on Friday.

Boies, 81, is the founder of law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP and represented Al Gore in the U.S. Supreme Court case over the 2000 presidential election recount. He told Reuters he will represent Allison Johnson in the divorce trial.

Judge Frances Giordano is presiding over the Johnson divorce, Boies said.

Johnson IV, whose personal fortune is estimated by Bloomberg at more than $6 billion, is expected to appear for opening statements inside a Lawrence, Massachusetts, courtroom for family and probate cases on Friday.

""It's expected those (opening) statements will lay out the case in some detail,"" Boies said in a telephone interview. ""It's a divorce case so it covers the basic issues of family law, including economic ones.""

Boies declined to provide any claims or details in the case, which has been impounded, a court order that shields it from public view.

Johnson IV and members of his legal team did not return messages seeking comment.

The divorce petition was filed more than a year ago but had not become public thus far.

Johnson IV is a director of FMR LLC, the parent company of Boston-based Fidelity. He is the youngest child of longtime Fidelity leader Edward ""Ned"" Johnson III, who died in March at age 91. Johnson IV's sister, Abigail Johnson, is Fidelity's chairman and chief executive.

As a director of FMR LLC, Johnson IV helps guide a family-controlled empire that generated $24 billion in revenue in 2021 and an operating profit of $8.1 billion.

The fortunes of his two sisters, Abigail and Elizabeth, are estimated at $21 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively.

Boies is well-known for representing the U.S. government in litigation against Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and for representing former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who was later convicted of sexual assault.

108,802,Microsoft,2022-05-05,Factbox: How companies account for remote work in their carbon footprints,"













May 5 (Reuters) - Reuters surveyed 20 large companies that both report their carbon footprints and embrace remote work about whether they estimate carbon emissions from employees' home offices.

Half of the companies measure the impact of remote work, with at least seven of those taking measures in response, while the other half had not done anything. Here are more details on how companies are confronting the challenging intersection of home offices and climate change. read more

ACCOUNTING FOR HOME OFFICES

Atlassian Corporation Plc (TEAM.O), a collaboration software maker, estimated emissions of 3,365 metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent (mtCO2e) in the year ended June 30, 2021 from remote work by its over 6,000 employees that year. Combined emissions from commuting and remote work fell 32% from the year-earlier period. Its goal to operate on 100% renewable energy does not apply to remote work, but it is evaluating how to address remote-work emissions.

Fidelity Investments Inc, a Boston-based financial services company, estimated 29,505 mtCO2e in 2020 from remote work by its 49,000 employees that year. It did not count the emissions in its carbon footprint.

Google, a unit of Silicon Valley tech company Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), estimated 56,000 mtCO2e in 2020 from remote work by its 135,000 employees that year. Its goal to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030 does not apply to remote work, but it purchases high-quality carbon credits to offset home-office emissions.

Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O), owner of Facebook, estimated 61,000 mtCO2e in 2020 combined from employee commuting and remote work by its about 58,600 employees that year. The combined emissions were down 32% from the prior year. It completely matched remote-work electricity use with renewable energy purchases.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), the U.S. tech giant, estimated 80,000 mtCO2e in the year ended June 30, 2021 combined from employee commuting and remote work by its 181,000 employees. It accounts for remote work in its goal to cut indirect emissions by more than half between 2020 and 2030.

Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), the video streaming service, said that it included estimates for remote-work emissions in its carbon footprint in 2020 but declined to elaborate.

Okta Inc (OKTA.O), a San Francisco-based software company, estimated 2,167 mtCO2e in the year ended Jan. 31, 2021 combined from employee commuting and remote work by its 2,800 employees. It completely matched remote-work electricity use with renewable energy purchases in the year ended Jan. 31, 2022.

Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N), a San Francisco business software maker with over 73,000 employees, estimated 22,000 mtCO2e in the year ended Jan. 31, 2021 from remote work. It excludes remote-work electricity from its goal of using 100% renewable energy, but did offset all emissions from remote work beginning with the year ended Jan. 31, 2022.

Shopify Inc (SHOP.TO), a commerce tools developer, estimated 1,300 mtCO2e in 2020 from remote work by its over 7,000 employees at the time. It completely matched remote-work electricity use with renewable energy.

Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE), a German industrials giant, estimated 22,000 mtCO2e in the year ended Sept. 30, 2021 from remote work by its 303,000 employees. It counts remote work in its goal to reduce scope 3, or indirect, emissions by 15% by 2030 compared with 2019.

PLANNING TO

Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), a San Francisco social media company, has not published any findings yet but said that it has developed ""a program that measures carbon emissions throughout the Twitter supply chain, including emissions from workers’ home offices and Twitter’s leased office spaces.""

CONSIDERING IT

Dropbox Inc (DBX.O), a San Francisco online storage provider, said it is committed to fighting global warming and exploring different reporting options, including to account for remote work.

Fujitsu (6702.T), a Japanese tech conglomerate, said it is considering factoring emissions from remote work in the future.

Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc (MMC.N), a New York-based professional services giant, said it is researching best options for measuring emissions from remote work as standards get refined.

Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co, a Columbus, Ohio financial services seller, said its home-office ""reporting method is not ready for primetime"" and that it would adopt ""new best practices"" on emissions accounting as it gains more experience with hybrid work.

Recreational Equipment Inc, a U.S. outdoor gear retailer also known as REI, said it continuously improves its emissions reporting and awaits uniform industry standards to account for remote work.

DECLINED TO SAY

U.S.-based online retailer Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) along with London-based consulting titan PricewaterhouseCoopers and San Francisco bank Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) do not estimate remote work emissions and all declined to comment on whether they would start doing so.

U.S. tech company Apple Inc (AAPL.O) said it has not estimated remote work emissions because ""we anticipated these emissions are small relative to our carbon footprint and we are still evolving our methodology.""

Summary Companies Series B round led by Future Positive

New investors include Ellen Degeneres

Also backed by Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures















LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - Nature-based carbon credit platform Pachama said on Thursday it had raised $55 million in a funding round led by venture capital firm Future Positive and backed by investors including talk-show host Ellen Degeneres.

Pachama, which focuses on saving and expanding forests across the world and uses artificial intelligence to verify carbon credits, said it would use the money to hire staff, drive research and development and launch more projects.

Companies are increasingly looking to buy carbon credits to help offset their emissions as the world moves to a low-carbon economy, but critics say it is hard to accurately assess how much carbon dioxide has been sequestered by forestry projects.

Pachama aims to fill this gap by providing more accurate data that is credible and transparent, giving more assurance to companies buying the credits to help meet their net-zero targets.

Among its more than 800 customers are leading companies including Salesforce (CRM.N), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Airbnb (ABNB.O) and Netflix (NFLX.O).

""Scaling carbon markets will play a critical role in our collective ability to decarbonise,"" said Fred Blackford, Founder and Managing Partner of Future Positive in a statement.

""Pachama is building the infrastructure to support functioning carbon markets by providing vital transparency and accountability around how carbon credits are issued and transacted.""

Other new investors in the company include actress Portia De Rossi, PLUS Capital, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, ReGen Ventures and 20VC, alongside previous investors including Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures and LowerCarbon Capital.

""It’s not a secret that forests are essential to removing carbon from the atmosphere, and yet the current afforestation market is fragmented and expensive,” said Carmichael Roberts, Breakthrough Energy Ventures.

Pachama's technology was enabling afforestation at scale and making carbon removal accessible for companies of any size, he said, and would be ""key to documenting carbon removal and accelerating carbon neutrality and negativity”.

Over the course of 3 years, the company said it had worked with 46 project developers in 14 countries and reviewed more than 150 forest projects globally.

Indexes fall: Dow 3.12%, S&P 3.56%, Nasdaq 4.99%















May 5 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended Thursday sharply lower amid a broad sell-off, as investor sentiment cratered in the face of concerns that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike the previous day would not be enough to tame surging inflation.

All three main Wall Street benchmarks erased gains made during a relief rally on Wednesday, with the Nasdaq posting its biggest one-day percentage decline since June 2020 and its lowest finish since November 2020.

The Dow's decline was its worst daily performance since October 2020.

Technology megacaps slumped. Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Meta Platforms (FB.O), Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) all fell between 4.3% and 8.3%.

However, it was not just high-growth stocks, which have struggled in 2022 as the prospect of rate rises had investors questioning their future earnings potential. The selloff hit all areas of the market, as traders headed for the exits.

""Investors aren't looking at fundamentals (such as earnings) right now, and this is more of a sentiment issue,"" said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors.

The U.S. central bank on Wednesday raised interest rates by half a percentage point as expected and Fed Chair Jerome Powell explicitly ruled out a hike of 75 basis points in a coming meeting.

Traders, however, on Thursday raised their bets on a 75 basis-point hike at the Fed's June meeting. IRPR

Worries about Fed policy moves, mixed earnings from some big growth companies, the conflict in Ukraine and pandemic-related lockdowns in China have hammered Wall Street recently, overshadowing a better-than-expected quarterly reporting season.

All of the 11 major S&P sectors declined, with consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) leading the way with a 5.8% drop. The index was dragged by Etsy Inc (ETSY.O) and eBay Inc (EBAY.O), down 16.8% and 11.7% respectively, after both forecast Q2 revenue would be below Wall Street's estimates.

The technology sector (.SPLRCT) was the next biggest loser, down 4.9%, with Intuit Inc (INTU.O) among those weighing the heaviest. It slipped 8.5%, to its lowest finish in a year, a day after agreeing to pay a $141 million settlement centered on deception claims around its TurboTax product. read more

""You're seeing those areas of the market which are purely discretionary, they are the ones getting hit today because everyone is anticipating that this is going to be a challenging period for consumers over the next several quarters,"" said Horneman of Verdence Capital Advisors.

REUTERS/Steve Marcus/File Photo















May 5 (Reuters) - Tech and financial companies leading efforts to cut climate changing emissions are finding a new challenge from remote work: the CO2 spewing out of home offices.

A few companies have begun counting what happens when employees boot up computers at home, turn up gas furnaces and ignore the world's most energy-efficient corporate campuses. It turns out that home setups popularized by the pandemic are eroding some of the climate benefit of abandoned commutes.

""Emissions didn't go away,"" said Amanda von Almen, head of emissions reduction at Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N). ""They just shifted to another area.""

Half of 20 big companies Reuters spoke to, including Salesforce, have estimated emissions from home offices.

Six of those reported detailed figures, showing their half a million workers collectively emitted the equivalent of 134,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide in about the first year of the pandemic. read more That is equivalent to consuming 15 million gallons of gasoline or burning 67,000 tonnes of coal.

While there are benefits to the climate from millions of employees not commuting when they work from home, the findings underscore that remote work is not a simple solution to cutting corporate emissions.

""Remote working has not delivered the environmental benefits that some people expected,"" said Steve Sorrell, professor of energy policy at University of Sussex. ""But they should probably have paid more attention to the decades of work in this area that suggest that environmental impacts may be less than expected.""

Companies reported varying benefits from the recent shift to telework. Salesforce found remote work has cut emissions 29% per employee, while Boston-based fund manager Fidelity Investments Inc found that moving to mostly remote work wiped out 87% of its emissions cuts in 2020.

Facebook, now Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O), calculated that employees through commutes and remote work produced more than a tonne of CO2 per person in 2020, down from 2 tonnes the year before - when just commuting was counted.

However, half of those companies Reuters surveyed are not counting home office emissions, including tech and finance leaders Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N).

""We anticipated these emissions are small relative to our carbon footprint and we are still evolving our methodology,"" Apple said in explaining its decision.

And even companies estimating the output from homes are divided on what to do about it. To honor its pledge to operate on 100% renewable energy, Meta has bought enough renewable energy credits to match remote workers' use, but it is not offsetting home-office natural gas.

Salesforce and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google excluded home-office electricity from their 100% goals as they weigh different initiatives for home use. Both, though, buy carbon credits to offset estimated emissions from telework.

Climate experts say those solutions scratch the surface: After pouring billions of dollars into traditional offices decked with rooftop solar, bathed in natural lighting and equipped with water recycling, employers transitioning to hybrid work need clear plans to make every location just as green.

""If we are serious about meeting our targets, then the corporate world needs to take the lead and think about homes as areas of improvement,"" said Eleftheria Kontou, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

HOW MANY LIGHTBULBS DOES IT TAKE...

One roadblock to counting home office emissions is that there is no standard on how or what to count. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), trying to solve the problem itself, concluded that remote staff work eight hours a day using a laptop, two monitors and three lightbulbs.

Others including Salesforce have surveyed workers about their homes and energy bills, and many companies just look at typical residential usage in the regions where their workers reside.

But if heating a home office requires heating an entire house, how are emissions counted? And how to account for a headquarters office that is available but unused?

At least five research analyses studying remote work, including one from the International Energy Agency, have generally warned that emissions could rise as companies keep powering traditional offices to provide flexibility and some workers take on further, albeit less frequent, commutes.

""In a worst-case scenario a hybrid working future could...create a world where buildings and homes are used inefficiently with a transport system that is unable to respond to changing demand and potentially more cars on roads,"" U.K.-based consultancy Carbon Trust wrote in a 2021 report on remote work.

In the face of uncertainty over counting, outdoor retailer REI Co-op will wait for ""uniform industry standards"" before accounting for the 10% of its workforce that is remote or mobile, said Andrew Dempsey, senior manager for sustainability, and it is not alone.

The nonprofit clearinghouse CDP said that fewer than 200 of the 13,000 companies reporting environmental data to it last year mentioned remote work and included relevant emissions. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, the most common accounting tool, has offered guidance on counting telework since 2011 but it does not specify how to calculate those emissions.

Corporate climate adviser William Theisen, North American chief of Atos SE's (ATOS.PA) EcoAct, described the limited reporting as concerning.

""I don’t think avoiding it is the responsible way to go,"" he said. ""If everyone was waiting for crystal-clear standards on counting remote work emissions, nothing would happen.""

112,828,Microsoft,2022-05-05,"'Some misfires,' says David Boies, but at 81 he's still at it","













(Reuters) - Over the course of 55 years practicing law, David Boies has seen many changes – and one constant.

The “basics of trying cases” remain remarkably unchanged, the Boies Schiller Flexner co-founder told me recently over lunch in San Francisco.

Boies, who made his name litigating landmark cases including the federal government’s antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp 25 years ago, noted that while courtroom technology looks very different, trials themselves are still “a morality play where a compelling narrative and credibility are key.”

At age 81, Boies continues to helm major litigations, serving as co-lead counsel in two pending class actions against Alphabet Inc’s Google with billions of dollars at stake.

The day before our April 22 lunch on the patio at the Presidio Social Club in San Francisco, he scored a unanimous win before the U.S. Supreme Court – an unusual feat during these divided times.

Boies represented a Jewish family trying to reclaim a Camille Pissarro painting seized by the Nazis in 1939 – after arguing the case remotely while sick with COVID-19. (He took “a triple dose of antihistamines” beforehand, he told me.)

That win and others recently stand in contrast to troubles Boies has faced in recent years. When we last met in person in the fall of 2018, Boies was grappling with reputational fallout from his work on behalf of ex-Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who was convicted of rape, and failed blood-testing company Theranos, whose founder Elizabeth Holmes earlier this year was found guilty of fraud. Boies represented both before their falls from grace and was criticized for using allegedly intimidating tactics to silence accusers, whistleblowers and journalists.

He bristled when I asked about the representations in a follow-up question last week. “Most of what is now written about my involvement with those clients is flat wrong, and most of the rest is misleadingly incomplete,” he said via email.

More recently, Boies was in the spotlight for notching a financial settlement for Virginia Giuffre, his pro bono client who accused Britain’s Prince Andrew of sexually abusing her when she was underage. Boies called the Giuffre settlement ""a great result for our client,"" but admitted that ""giving up the chance to examine Prince Andrew was certainly a personal disappointment.”

The case settled shortly before the prince was set to be deposed by Boies. Andrew did not admit wrongdoing. The prince’s lawyer, Andrew Brettler of Lavely & Singer, did not respond to an initial request for comment sent to an administrator at his firm. He later declined to comment.

Boies is also kicking off a trial on Friday in Massachusetts state court – a divorce case, of all things – representing the soon-to-be-ex-wife of billionaire Fidelity Investments heir Edward Johnson IV.

And he’s lead counsel in securities class action against Grupo Televisa and co-lead in a products liability class action against automobile manufacturers who installed the Takata exploding air bags.

“It has been a whirlwind,” Boies said of his year to date.

Still, his namesake firm has seen its share of turbulence.

Since 2018, Boies Schiller has been hit with waves of departures shrinking from more than 300 lawyers to about 160 today. According to Law.com, the firm’s gross revenue in 2021 fell about 8% to $230 million compared to 2020, and profits per partner dipped slightly to $2.2 million.

“We have had some misfires in our attempts to transition to new firm leadership,” Boies acknowledged. In January, former deputy chair Natasha Harrison departed to launch her own boutique firm in London. But he said the “leadership team we have in place now is terrific, and the demands on my time (for firm management) are increasingly less.”

In the next few months, Boies expects final approval of a $2.67 billion antitrust class action settlement against Blue Cross Blue Shield. As co-lead counsel with Hausfeld LLP, Boies and his firm are poised to reap a sizeable portion of up to $667.5 million in legal fees.

A status conference in Birmingham, Alabama, federal court is set for May 16, and Boies said he thinks it will be the last hearing before the court signs off on the deal.

Over a meatloaf meatballs appetizer followed by a burger and fries (“That’s a lot of food,” our server commented when the slight Boies placed his order), he took a step back and talked about the changes he’s seen in the legal profession since he joined Cravath, Swaine & Moore as an associate in 1966.

Boies hailed the “greater focus on diversity and inclusion, increased emphasis on pro bono service, and the introduction and use of technology that enables smaller firms to compete with larger firms.”

But he sees other developments as more troubling, noting that increases in hourly rates have made first-tier legal services unaffordable to most individuals and smaller businesses. If ""lawyers get paid like investment bankers, they may end up acting, and maybe even having to act, like investment bankers,"" he said.

Moreover, he observed, the pressure to raise lawyer compensation in order to recruit competitively has resulted in some firms reducing their pro bono commitments.

Looking forward, the Google suits – one is an antitrust action on behalf of digital publishers, while the other accuses the internet search company of illegally invading the privacy of millions of users – are keeping Boies busy.

They stand as bookends to Boies’ career, which was jumpstarted 50 years ago, when he successfully defended IBM in an antitrust suit brought by the Justice Department.

Still, life is not all work and no play for Boies. He’s going on a one-week bike trip in Portugal in June (the 56th foreign bike trip he and his wife Mary have taken over the last 32 years) followed by a two-week African safari in August.

“I continue my pattern of taking my retirement in installments,” he said.

(NOTE: This column has been updated to reflect that the lawyer for Prince Andrew, Andrew Brettler, declined to comment.)

Summary Companies Nasdaq drops more than 4%

Twitter falls as short-seller Hindenburg flags risk to Musk deal

Indexes: Dow down 2%, S&P 500 down 3.2%, Nasdaq down 4.3%















NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended below 4,000 for the first time since late March 2021 and the Nasdaq dropped more than 4% on Monday in a selloff led by mega-cap growth shares as investors grew more concerned about rising interest rates.

The Nasdaq closed at its lowest level since November 2020. Apple (AAPL.O) shares dropped 3.3% and were the biggest weight on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) dropped 3.7% and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) fell 9.1%.

Investors are worried about how aggressive the Federal Reserve will need to be to tame inflation. The U.S. central bank last week hiked interest rates by 50 basis points.

114,821,Microsoft,2022-05-09,Forest loss and escalating emissions fuel drive for technologies to remove CO2 from air,"Summary Demand from corporates seeking to offset emissions and government incentives boosting companies that are removing carbon directly from the atmosphere

Biggest momentum is in the United States, where President Biden’s infrastructure bill has authorised $3.5 billion to create four DAC hubs

Environmentalists concerned that the first commercial-scale plant, in Permian basin, will use captured CO2 to help extract oil, undermining green transition

Companies also plan to combine CO2 with green hydrogen to make fossil-fuel free fuels for aviation and road transport















May 9 - Travelling any road to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will require us to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, according to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. Various climate scenarios suggest some 6 billion tonnes a year may need to be sequestered by mid-century, because some industries will still emit CO2, and residual emissions will need to be mopped up.

A decade ago, direct air capture (DAC) was dismissed as unproven and far too expensive to have in the armoury. But things look different as 2030, the decisive date to slash emissions, looms large, and studies show the traditional role of tropical forests in sequestering carbon is weakening due to escalating forest loss from wildfires and the incursion of agriculture.

A study last year found that the Amazon river basin is teetering on the verge of becoming a net emitter of CO2, capturing only 120,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. New government data from Brazil on the weekend showed that deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon in the first four months of 2022 increased 69% compared to the same period of 2021, clearing an area more than double the size of New York City.

One big advantage of direct air capture is its relatively compact physical footprint. According to one scientific study the technology would require on average 20 square kilometres of space to capture as much CO2 as is still being captured by the Brazilian Amazon.

But replicating a service provided by nature for free will not come cheap. Unlike carbon capture and storage, which captures carbon from the flue gases of a power station or other industrial processes, where CO2 is highly concentrated, CO2 accounts for only 0.04% of our atmosphere. That means huge amounts of energy are required to process and capture it.

And with only 18 direct air capture facilities operating in Canada, Europe and the United States, together capturing only 10,000 tonnes of CO2, the technology will need to scale extremely rapidly if it is to capture more than 85 million tonnes by 2030, and 980 million tonnes by 2050, as envisaged in the International Energy Agency's net-zero emissions scenario.

In Iceland last year Climeworks opened the world’s largest plant, capable of capturing 4,000 tonnes of CO2 a year. In a process powered by geothermal energy, air is drawn by fans onto a solid filter material, which the carbon dioxide sticks to. Once saturated with CO2, the collectors are heated to release the gas, which is mixed with water and injected at pressure into basalt rock, by Climeworks’ Icelandic partner Carbfix. The CO2 becomes rock within a few years, and thus is locked away.

Although these offsets cost as high as 800 pounds sterling per tonne ($986) of CO2 removed, such has been the demand from the likes of Microsoft, Swiss Re, and payment software platform Stripe that Climeworks managed to raise $650 million to scale the technology, and now aims to have a plant 10 times larger up and running in the next few years.

Last month a group of brands, including Google parent Alphabet, Meta, Shopify, Stripe and McKinsey & Co signed up to a platform called Frontier that will pool commitments to spend $925 million over the next eight years on technologies to remove CO2, including direct air capture, in a bid to scale the technologies and bring down costs.

As well as storing carbon dioxide extracted from the air, companies are combining CO2 with green hydrogen to make synthetic fuels, also known as e-fuels, which can help cut emissions from aviation and road transport.

Houston-based HIF Global, along with Siemens Energy, Porsche and other international partners, expect a pilot e-fuels plant in Chile to come on stream later this year. The Haru Oni demonstration plant will producing 130,000 litres of e-fuels a year, combining captured CO2 with green hydrogen powered by wind turbines.

HIF, which stands for “highly innovative fuels”, last month announced plans to build 12 e-fuels facilities globally, which it says will capture 25 million tonnes of CO2 per year and produce 150,000 barrels per day of synthetic fuel from 2026.

Meanwhile, British Columbia-based Carbon Engineering, which is capturing CO2 for both storage and the production of e-fuels, is planning to start producing 100 million litres of synthetic fuels in 2026 at a plant in Canada.

The biggest momentum on direct air storage is in the United States, where President Biden’s infrastructure bill last November authorised $3.5 billion to create four DAC hubs, and another $4.6bn to support enabling infrastructure like CO2 pipelines and geologic sequestration.

There are also several legislative proposals to quadruple the 45Q tax incentive for carbon storage from $45 to $180 per tonne, while California’s low-carbon fuel standard, which mandates reductions in the carbon intensity of transport, includes a credit for DAC plants of about $200 per tonne of CO2.

Both were used to finance the world’s first large-scale DAC plant, currently being built in the Permian basin by 1PointFive, a joint venture involving Occidental’s subsidiary, Oxy Low Carbon Ventures, and Carbon Engineering.

Although 1PointFive also plans to use Carbon Engineering’s technology to make synthetic fuels, in the Permian Basin project the 1 million tonnes of CO2 captured per year will be pumped into the ground and used to extract oil that would otherwise remain trapped under the surface, a process known as enhanced oil recovery.

Such plans have sparked concern among some academics and environmentalists that carbon removal technologies could add to the climate crisis, rather than help to solve it, by increasing the production of fossil fuels, and delaying action to prevent CO2 emissions from happening in the first place.

Occidental, which plans 70 DAC plants by 2035, recently told investors that the CO2 captured and trapped in an EOR reservoir can equal the equivalent lifecycle emissions of each barrel of oil extracted, to produce what it describes as “net zero oil”.

In an interview, Amy Ruddock, European vice president for Carbon Engineering, defended the approach, saying that “when you do enhanced oil recovery, you’d better do your best to decarbonise it”. Moreover, she said, getting DAC to scale means “you need to really look for those markets, which can support direct capture to get going down that cost curve”.

In the UK, Carbon Engineering recently won funding from the UK government to help develop its processes for a project with Storegga Geotechnologies in north-east Scotland. It could potentially tap into carbon transport and storage infrastructure Storegga is developing through the Acorn carbon capture and storage project.

Ruddock said she is also talking to the UK government about a funding mechanism for greenhouse gas removals. One option is to create a contracts for difference mechanism, similar to those used to develop wind and solar in the UK.

At European Union level there are discussions about integrating DAC into its carbon market, and detailed work on carbon-removal certification is under way.

Christoph Beuttler, head of climate policy at Climeworks, said in an interview that he is encouraged by the backing now being given to DAC, though he acknowledges that the industry will need to innovate to cut down on its vast energy needs.

Climeworks hasn’t disclosed the energy consumption of its plant in Iceland, but the biggest demand is heat for releasing the CO2. “We could look at things like solar thermal and heat pumps, but again, that would require improvements in solar thermal. So that's what I mean by building an industry. That there are many, many things that have to be improved.”

Storage for the CO2 that DAC plants will collect will also need to be developed. Climeworks is exploring locations in Norway and in Oman, where there is both availability of renewable energy and geologic storage.

“You will need more energy than you get out. But it's the only way to get off fossil CO2. That's the reality of it, unfortunately,” says Beuttler.

He adds: “We are in a tight spot, in terms of our climate goals. This type of technology gives us the opportunity to just make it. But we have to pull everything together.”

May 9 (Reuters) - FedEx Corp (FDX.N) can boost its profit by $1 billion annually if the delivery giant leverages its ShopRunner buyout and its partnership with Microsoft to deepen its e-commerce presence and cater directly to customers, Citigroup analysts said on Monday.

The brokerage's report, which also said the company could nearly double its share price in four years from current levels, comes as FedEx struggles with slowing growth after a pandemic-fueled surge in online shipments.

""FedEx could become ecommerce's universal shopping cart by augmenting ShopRunner's hundreds of merchant partners to thousands, and building a base of millions of subscribers that would get free expedited shipping,"" Citigroup analyst Christian Wetherbee said on Monday.

Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx acquired e-commerce platform ShopRunner in 2020, while entering into a partnership with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) earlier this year.

""By leveraging ShopRunner assets through incremental technology investments with its partner Microsoft, we think FedEx can make itself a bigger part of the checkout process, increasing its role in the ecommerce sales experience,"" the analyst said.

Wetherbee said currently consumers have little or no choice over which company delivers the products they have bought online.

In March, FedEx posted lower-than-expected quarterly earnings, hit by ongoing labor woes and the Omicron outbreak, and said second-half ground margins would miss internal targets. read more

FedEx's shares were flat at about $208 in early trade on Monday. They have lost nearly 20% of their value this year, through Friday's close.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration















May 10 (Reuters) - Ahead of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Western intelligence agencies warned of potential cyberattacks which could spread elsewhere and cause ""spillover"" damage on global computer networks.

While there has been little evidence of spillover to date, the cyberwar in Ukraine rages on. The following is an overview of how the conflict has unfolded in cyberspace:

EARLY DAYS

In 2021, groups aligned with Russian security services began laying the groundwork for a military incursion, according to Microsoft. read more

The company said suspected Russian cyber actors gained access to the networks of several different Ukrainian energy and IT providers in late 2021. Some of these targets were later hit in 2022 with destructive computer viruses that deleted data and disabled computers.

BEFORE THE INVASION

There were a flurry of cyber operations against Ukrainian targets in the weeks ahead of Russia's invasion on Feb. 24.

In January, researchers discovered destructive malware called WhisperGate circulating in Ukraine.

WhisperGate closely mirrored a 2017 Russian cyberattack against Ukraine, known as NotPetya, that similarly destroyed data on thousands of local computer systems. read more

After WhisperGate's discovery, a spate of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks briefly knocked Ukrainian banking and government websites offline. The DDoS flood was later attributed to Russia by Britain and the United States. read more

Then, days before the invasion, cybersecurity researchers discovered more data-wiping malware in Ukraine.

Slovakian cybersecurity firm ESET said it found new wipers which were engineered months prior. The discovery indicated that Russia's hackers knew tensions between the Kremlin and Kyiv would soon escalate.

Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said on Tuesday that Russian Military Intelligence was ""almost certainly"" behind the Whispergate malware.

WAR STARTS

In the early hours of Feb. 24, as Russian forces entered eastern Ukraine, hackers crippled tens of thousands of satellite internet modems in Ukraine and across Europe. read more

The modems provided internet to thousands of Ukrainians. It remains one of the biggest publicly known cyberattacks to have taken place in the conflict.

The attack, against a network controlled by U.S. satellite firm Viasat, caused a ""really huge loss in communications"" at the outset of the war, senior Ukrainian cybersecurity official Victor Zhora said. read more

Britain and the European Union attributed the digital blitz against Viasat's network to Russia on Tuesday. Britain's Foreign Office said Russia was behind the operation, citing ""new UK and U.S. intelligence,"" without elaborating. read more

HYBRID WAR

After the invasion, Russian hackers compromised several important Ukrainian organizations, including nuclear power companies, media firms and government entities, according to Microsoft.

Though it is difficult to track the goals of each hack, one notable incident happened on Mar. 1, when a missile strike against Kyiv's TV tower coincided with widespread destructive cyberattacks on Kyiv-based media.

Days later, Microsoft detected a Russian group on the networks of an unnamed Ukrainian nuclear power company, just as Russia's military occupied the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power station - the largest of its kind in Europe.

Senior U.S. national security officials say Moscow is now combining Russia's cyber and military forces.

""We have seen the Russians having an integrated approach to using physical and cyberattacks, in an integrated way, to achieve their brutal objectives in Ukraine,"" senior White House cybersecurity official Anne Neuberger told a conference.

INDUSTROYER

On April 12, Zhora, ESET and Ukraine's computer emergency response team said in a series of statements that an elite Russian hacking team known as Sandworm, which attacked Ukraine's power grid in 2015, had attempted days earlier to cause another blackout in the country.

The hackers, reportedly part of Russia's military intelligence agency, designed a piece of malware named Industroyer 2, which could manipulate equipment in electrical utilities to control the flow of power.

Industroyer 2 had been deployed on an unnamed electrical substation that provides power to roughly 2 million locals, Ukrainian officials said. While the attack failed, Zhora said, the ""intended disruption was huge.""

HACKTIVISM

As war broke out, Ukraine called on hacktivists to help the country defend itself from Russia.

Since then, a steady stream of unnamed, anonymous hacktivists from both sides have taken to social media claiming to have conducted successful intrusions into either Russian or Ukrainian targets.

In some cases, the hacktivists have posted screenshots or caches of documents to prove their claims, but their actions have proven difficult to verify or measure, researchers say.

Russian government agencies and companies seemingly affected by the Ukraine-allied hacktivists have declined to comment.

May 9 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Monday that it would extend its abortion and gender affirming care services for employees in the United States to include travel expense assistance.

Several companies, including Yelp Inc (YELP.N), Citigroup (C.N), Levi Strauss & Co (LEVI.N), and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), have already pledged to cover costs for American employees who need to travel out of state for an abortion. read more

Some major employers, such as Walmart Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N), have not weighed in since the leak to Politico last week of a Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn its 1973 decision legalizing abortion nationwide. read more

The issue has gained urgency now that 31 states have introduced abortion bans this year, according to policy analysis by research group Guttmacher Institute.

Microsoft will ""continue to do everything we can under the law to protect our employees' rights and support employees"" in accessing critical healthcare, which includes services like abortion and gender-affirming care, in the United States, a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters.

""This support is being extended to include travel expense assistance for these and other medical services where access to care is limited in availability in an employee's home geographic region.""

118,381,Microsoft,2022-05-10,"Nintendo plays a safer, shorter game than Sony","













HONG KONG, May 10 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Component shortages have hurt gaming giants Sony (6758.T) and Nintendo (7974.T), but the latter's stock is up 5% year-to-date, while its rival tumbled by more than a quarter. Earnings on Tuesday from the Japanese duo underscore the sharp divergence in their strategies.

Both are seeing sales of their key gaming consoles plunge. Sony saw March quarterly sales of its cash-cow PlayStation 5 device drop nearly 40% year-on-year to 2 million units, while Nintendo, the $56 billion creator of Super Mario, sold 20% less Switch units in the year to March than in the previous year.

As a conglomerate, $105 billion Sony is more exposed to war in Ukraine, surging commodity prices and China's Covid-19 lockdowns: consumer electronics and semiconductors account for more than a third of its annual top line. Meanwhile, its PlayStation business looks outgunned read more by the $2 trillion Microsoft (MSFT.O), whose Xbox device competes for more serious gamers.

Series C round brings total capital raised by Evisort to $155 million















(Reuters) - Evisort Inc, which makes AI-powered contract management software for companies, said Wednesday it has raised $100 million in Series C funding spearheaded by Silicon Valley venture capital firm TCV.

Breyer Capital and existing backers including General Atlantic and Microsoft's venture capital fund, M12, participated in the round. The funding brings total capital raised for San Mateo, California-based Evisort to $155 million, the company said.

Contract management companies have continued attracting investor attention in 2022, including SirionLabs Inc, which on Tuesday said it raised an $85 million Series D round.

Two other companies in the space, LinkSquares Inc and Ironclad Inc, said they raised $100 million and $150 million, respectively, earlier this year.

TCV, which has backed companies like Airbnb Inc and Netflix Inc, has also invested in legal tech companies Clio and LegalZoom.com Inc, according to its website.

Evisort said its capital raise included equity and venture debt financing.

Summary Companies Producer prices decelerate in April

S&P 500 flirts with bear market confirmation

Tapestry jumps after upbeat Q3 results

Indexes: Dow down 0.33%, S&P off 0.13%, Nasdaq up 0.06%















NEW YORK, May 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended a whipsaw session slightly lower on Thursday, as investors juggled signs of peaking inflation with fears that it could remain elevated, prompting ever more aggressive tightening from the Federal Reserve.

All three major U.S. stock indexes seesawed and the S&P 500 came within striking distance of confirming it entered a bear market after swooning from its all-time high reached on Jan. 3.

When the dust settled, the S&P and the Dow ended modestly red, but the Nasdaq eked out a modest gain.

The indexes have gyrated wildly in recent sessions, often reversing initial rallies or sell-offs by the closing bell.

""These wild swings of upwards of 2% up or down are extremely rare, and showcase a very fragile investor psyche for that amount of volatility to happen in such a short time frame,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Continued concerns over inflation, which looks like it has peaked yet is staying stubbornly high, continues to concern investors, pushing the S&P to the brink of a bear market.""

Market leading megacap names, which thrived during the low interest environment of the pandemic, were the biggest drag, with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) weighing the heaviest.

Recent economic data, most recently the Producer Prices report released before the opening bell, suggested price growth reached its zenith in March. read more

Even so, the Fed is expected to hike key interest rates by at least 50 basis points at least three times in the coming months, in an effort to toss cold water on demand and rein in soaring prices. read more

The U.S. Senate on Friday confirmed Jerome Powell for a second term as Fed Chairman.

The move ""was widely expected and it opens the door for the Fed to continue to battle the 40-year inflation highs, with many more interest rate hikes likely coming this year,"" Detrick added.

Inflation

The conflict, dubbed by Russian President Vladimir Putin as a ""special military operation,"" has fanned the flames of inflation by pressuring global energy and grain supplies.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 103.81 points, or 0.33%, to 31,730.3, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 5.1 points, or 0.13%, to 3,930.08 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 6.73 points, or 0.06%, to 11,370.96.

Six of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 wrapped up the day in positive territory, with healthcare (.SPXHC) enjoying the largest percentage gain.

Utilities (.SPLRCU) and tech stocks (.SPLRCT) suffered the biggest losses.

Earnings season is nearing the final stretch, and according to the most recent data, 79% of the S&P 500 companies who have posted results delivered better-than-expected earnings, according to Refinitiv.

Analysts now see aggregate first-quarter S&P 500 earnings growth of 11%, up from 6.4% at quarter-end, per Refinitiv.

122,804,Microsoft,2022-05-17,The communication compliance consequences of hybrid working,"Companies

Companies Law firms Bloomberg Follow

Microsoft Follow















While government regulators may be geographically neutral — it doesn’t matter to them where staff members are working within a jurisdiction — all compliance and security controls must be equally effective regardless of location.

As the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) stated, “any form of remote or hybrid working adopted should not risk or compromise the firm’s ability to follow all rules, regulatory standards and obligations, or lead to a failure to meet them.”

A specific concern is that of communications. In October 2021, Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the Division of Enforcement at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), warned that companies “need to be actively thinking about and addressing the many compliance issues raised by the increased use of personal devices, new communications channels, and other technological developments like ephemeral apps.”

Integral to hybrid working and the communications compliance challenges across the industry, of course, are dynamic collaboration tools, such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Webex by Cisco, RingCentral, and Slack. These platforms were rapidly adopted to ensure that businesses could stay connected throughout the pandemic, and now, they continue to be the mainstay of communication methods regardless of where staff work.

The ever-growing volume of video, voice, chat, and document content, however, makes being able to actively detect risks to compliance or security and losses of data more challenging than ever. Particularly where existing controls or tools are designed for email.

The communications conundrum

For many firms, there still remains a lot of catching up to do to ensure interactions across these modern methods for meeting, communicating, and sharing information have the same level of oversight and controls as those conducted in physical offices or more traditional text-based communication methods such as email.

Three of the more challenging issues relate to the ability to have a clear line of sight into communications themselves, include:

Compliance, risk, and legal teams need to ensure they can quickly and comprehensively identify and extract relevant records from collaboration tools. That includes audio, video, chat, and document content as well as whiteboards and polling, along with contextual information such as GIFs, reactions, and emojis. This is a particular challenge with tools built for email that would not identify offensive images or account information on-screen, for example.

Being able to swiftly search for records relating to customers, staff, products, meetings, or transactions is critical for regulatory supervision, legal investigations, HR matters, internal audits, or to respond to customer complaints or data deletion requests under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other privacy rules.

Existing requirements for recording and supervising electronic communications apply to the wider communication modes now available, from in-meeting chat and whiteboards to comments in Sharepoint, for example. Regulators have been quick to clarify the scope of rules, and firms must ensure their recordkeeping and supervision processes and controls have kept pace.

The widening scope is evident from the European Securities and Markets Authority’s (ESMA) confirmation that electronic communications “includes among others video conferencing, fax, email, Bloomberg mail, SMS, business-to-business devices, chat, instant messaging and mobile device applications,” adding, that it “will not produce an exhaustive list of electronic communications because of the continuing innovation and advancement in technology which would mean the list frequently becomes out-of-date.”

Another example is the US Financial Industry Regulatory Authority’s (FINRA) response regarding the supervision of “visual aids, such as a whiteboard or dynamic charts, or a chat or instant messaging feature during a live, unscripted online conference,” which confirmed that, “the use of these visual aids may be correspondence, retail communications or institutional communications, and the firm must supervise them as such.”

The ability to view a complete audit trail of a chat conversation is fundamental to effective supervision and detecting compliance and security risks such as misconduct, collusion, or data leakage. Reconstructing continuous and fluid conversations involving multiple participants that can span days or even years while capturing the full content as well as the context of conversations, presents firms with complex compliance challenges.

This is particularly the case with tools built for email that would not identify reactions or emojis that indicate collusion, for example. Firms need to ensure that they can fully capture the text, audio files, links, images, GIFs, emojis, and reactions — all of which can alter the interpretation of communications —as well as the native view showing how the chat conversation flowed.

Another use for artificial intelligence?

In an environment where it has never been so easy for anyone to digitally record and share externally what is happening across modern communications, it is essential for organizations to be ahead of the curve in detecting and dealing with potentially reputationally damaging risks, ranging from data loss to threatening behavior.

Comparable to finding a needle in a haystack, purpose-built risk detections using artificial intelligence that’s been trained to detect conduct, compliance, or security issues should enable firms to find the risks across its communications quickly, while benefitting from significant efficiencies and cost savings.

Summary Companies Walmart slides after cutting earnings forecast

April retail sales rise in line with estimates

S&P 500 +2.02%, Nasdaq +2.76%, Dow +1.34%















May 17 (Reuters) - Wall Street finished sharply higher on Tuesday, lifted by Apple, Tesla and other megacap growth stocks after strong retail sales in April eased worries about slowing economic growth.

Ten of the 11 major S&P sector indexes advanced, with financials (.SPSY), materials (.SPLRCM), consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) and technology (.SPLRCT) all gaining more than 2%.

Investors were cheered by data showing U.S. retail sales increased 0.9% in April as consumers bought motor vehicles amid an improvement in supply and frequented restaurants. read more

Recently punished shares of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) gained between 2% and 5.1%, driving the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq higher.

Tuesday's broad rally followed weeks of selling on the U.S. stock market that last week saw the S&P 500 sink to its lowest level since March 2021.

""The largest pockets of stocks that investors tend to buy have been essentially beaten up. They're either in correction or bear market territory,"" said Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer of Defiance ETF. ""I think investors are looking at these opportunities to buy on the dip, and I suspect that today is a good day to do that.""

The S&P 500 Banks index (.SPXBK) jumped 3.8%, with Citigroup (C.N) climbing almost 8% after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) disclosed a nearly $3 billion investment in the U.S. lender.

Another set of economic data showed industrial production accelerated 1.1% last month, higher than estimates of 0.5%, and faster than a 0.9% advance in March. read more

""This is consistent with continued economic growth in the second quarter and not a recession underway,"" said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank in Dallas.

The U.S. Federal Reserve will ""keep pushing"" to tighten U.S. monetary policy until it is clear inflation is declining, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at an event on Tuesday. read more

The Nasdaq gained 2.76% to 11,984.52 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.34% to 32,654.59 points.

S&P 500's busiest trades

Underscoring Wall Street's recent volatility, the S&P 500 has gained or lost 2% or more in a session some 39 times so far in 2022, compared to 24 times in all of 2021.

Walmart Inc (WMT.N) tumbled 11.4% after the retail giant cut its annual profit forecast, signaling a hit to its margins. That marked the biggest one-day percentage drop for Walmart's stock since 1987. read more

Retailers Costco (COST.O), Target (TGT.N) and Dollar Tree (DLTR.O) fell between 0.8% and 3.2%.

United Airlines Holdings Inc (UAL.O) gained 7.9% after the carrier lifted its current-quarter revenue forecast, boosting shares of Delta Air (DAL.N), American Airlines (AAL.O) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE.N). read more

A positive first-quarter earnings season has been overshadowed by worries about the conflict in Ukraine, soaring inflation, COVID-19 lockdowns in China and aggressive policy tightening by central banks.

The S&P 500 is down about 14% so far in 2022, and the Nasdaq is off around 23%, hit by tumbling growth stocks.

U.S.-listed Chinese stocks jumped on hopes that China will ease its crackdown on the technology sector. read more

124,740,Microsoft,2022-05-17,Australian banks enter tech arms race as rising rates squeeze profit,"













SYDNEY, May 18 (Reuters) - The 10-minute home loan - at the tap of a smartphone screen - is emerging as the next frontier in Australian banking as rising interest rates quash a pandemic-fuelled property boom, eating into mortgage income and renewing focus on cost-cutting tech.

The Big Four lenders booked blockbuster profit during the COVID-19 pandemic due to a leap of nearly one-third in property prices since 2020, but raging inflation brought a shock rate hike this month and expectations of several more. read more

That has left banks, which make most of their profit from mortgages, looking to automate every step of the loan process and cut overheads such as staffing and real estate to keep growing profit from what analysts say may be a shrinking pool of money.

So far only Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) (CBA.AX), the biggest lender, has put a speed target on its automation drive. It said a fully digitised loan service that went live on Tuesday could process an application in as little as 10 minutes.

But in earnings updates this month, National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB) (NAB.AX), Westpac Banking Corp (WBC.AX) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) (ANZ.AX) all pointed to automation to offset the impact of a cooling property market.

""They're incentivised to invest in tech and get up to where CBA is because it drives people online,"" said Hugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas Funds Management, which holds shares of major banks.

""They can improve profit without growing their top line.""

Citi banking analyst Brendan Sproules in a client note said chief executive officers face an ""endless battle to transform their 1970s/80s process and systems into the modern digital age"".

""A rising cash rate might just provide the opportunity to accelerate this transformation along faster than we first thought.""

Instead of filling in paper forms and supplying documents, to be verified and analysed by back-office staff, a customer would enter the address of a property they planned to buy plus their bank account login. Their computer or smartphone camera would confirm their identity.

Algorithms figure out the rest, such as employment history and probable purchase price.

A bank employee only steps in if the software picks up discrepancies in the data, people who work on loan automation software said.

Some smaller and online-only lenders already automate mortgage applications but - until now - not the Big Four, which dominate Australia's A$10 trillion ($7.00 trillion) housing market with three-quarters of loans by value.

""What we're seeing right now is a lot of optimisation using existing processes, using existing loan origination systems,"" said Hessel Verbeek, head of banking strategy at KPMG Australia.

""The room for improvement will include when people actually start to replace some of the key systems.""

Banks have not specified how much money they plan to spend automating mortgage approvals, nor how much they would save.

Of the A$3.6 billion the Big Four invested in the first half of the 2022 financial year, 35% went to ""productivity and growth"", versus 32% a year earlier, showed data from KPMG.

NAB, the second-biggest lender, said last week its ""investment in customer experience, efficiency and sustainable revenue"" rose 46% in October-March from the same period a year earlier, to A$228 million. It said it wants every home loan automated by 2024.

ANZ, which has been losing mortgages for two years as understaffing led to a surge in approval times, said it has only begun work digitising processes.

""There's no doubt we've got some catching up to do,"" CEO Shayne Elliott was quoted as saying in The Australian.

SLOW START

Banks were slow to start automating retail products partly because large compliance and risk management overhauls sapped both investment budgets and management attention since regulatory scrutiny dramatically increased in 2018, analysts and industry participants said.

Rebecca Engel, head of Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Australian financial services unit, said there was a ""massive increase in investment, deployment, acceptance and trust in technology"" by banks in tandem with heightened regulatory attention and higher transaction volume during the pandemic.

""The goal should be higher levels of assurance, higher levels of quality, at a lower cost,"" Engel told Reuters.

""That is driven by technology.""

125,57,Microsoft,2022-05-17,Self-driving startup Wayve taps Microsoft for 'supercomputer muscle',"













LONDON, May 18 (Reuters) - British startup Wayve said on Wednesday it will use supercomputer infrastructure designed for the firm by its investor Microsoft (MSFT.O) to process vast amounts of data as it develops machine learning-based models for self-driving cars.

Wayve's technology relies on machine learning using camera sensors fitted on the outside of the vehicle, where the system learns from traffic patterns and the behaviour of other drivers, instead of the conventional method of relying on detailed digital maps and coding to tell vehicles how to operate.

""Microsoft is providing supercomputing muscle,"" Wayve Chief Executive Alex Kendall told Reuters. ""What we're looking to do goes beyond the bounds of what's possible for commercial cloud offerings today.""

Kendall said Microsoft will be able to process the terabyte of data - 1 trillion bytes, or equivalent to around an hour of consumer video - that Wayve's cars generate every minute.

That will help the startup as it scales up its self-driving technology for trials on last-mile delivery vehicles with UK online grocery technology company Ocado (OCDO.L) and supermaket chain Asda.

Those grocery delivery trials will start this year with a human safety operator on board.

""We see this as being a commercial fleet offering,"" he said. ""That's how we think autonomy is first going to come to market.""

Earlier this year, Microsoft participated in the London-based startup's $200 million Series B funding round. read more

126,586,Microsoft,2022-05-18,Morning Bid: Extreme fear? Seriously?,"













A look at the day ahead in markets from Julien Ponthus.

One might think that with CNN's popular gauge of investor sentiment stuck on 'extreme fear', it would take some seriously good news to lift up markets these days.

But all it took yesterday was a whiff of COVID-19 optimism from China and decent U.S. retail data to send global equity markets back into a jolly bullish risk-on mode.

Tech and growth stocks that many investors would no longer touch with a barge pole outperformed with Microsoft (MSFT.O), Apple (AAPL.O) Tesla (TSLA.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) lifting the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq higher.

The upbeat mood was hard to reconcile with BofA's self-described ""extremely bearish"" monthly survey which showed fund managers had not been as underweight on stocks since May 2020. read more

Supposedly weary traders were also more than happy to knock the dollar further away from last week's two-decade high and dash into riskier currency bets across Oceania, Asia, Europe and even cyberspace with bitcoin claiming back $30k.

Adding to the upward thrust enjoyed by the dollar's rivals were fast rising bond yields displaying confidence central banks would be able to carry on monetary tightening despite lingering recession fears and Citi's economic surprise index falling in negative territory.

Even U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell insisting interest rates would go as high as needed to tame inflation didn't deter the buy-the-dip crowd. read more

As it stands this morning in Europe though, the latest batch of data might have the bulls hesitate before seeking to pursue this tentative bounce any further.

Consider this: in the last few hours Japan announced its economy shrank in the January-March period, China said new-home prices in April fell and Britain just unveiled its highest inflation reading since the 1980s with a whopping 9% in April. read more

127,337,Microsoft,2022-05-18,"Mastercard to cover employee travel, lodging for out-of-state abortions","













May 18 (Reuters) - Mastercard Inc (MA.N) on Wednesday said it will fund travel and lodging for employees seeking abortions outside their home states from June, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.

Three of the six major U.S. banks have already taken initial steps towards the effort. Citigroup Inc (C.N) began covering travel expenses for employees who go out of state for abortions in March, the first major bank to do so.

Peers JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) are also reviewing its policies that cover abortion benefits for employees. read more

Besides expenses related to pregnancy terminations, Mastercard will also cover surrogacies, adoption services, vasectomies and access to contraception, the memo said.

128,97,Microsoft,2022-05-18,Microsoft seeks to dodge EU cloud computing probe with changes,"[1/2] President of Microsoft Brad Smith reacts during an interview with Reuters at the Web Summit, in Lisbon, Portugal, November 3, 2021. REUTERS/Pedro Nunes















BRUSSELS, May 18 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) will revise its licensing deals and make it easier for cloud service providers to compete, its president Brad Smith said on Wednesday, as the U.S. software giant sought to dodge a lengthy EU antitrust probe into its cloud computing business.

Microsoft was fined 1.6 billion euros ($1.7 billion) by EU antitrust regulators in the previous decade for various violations.

The company found itself under the EU competition body's scrutiny again after German software provider NextCloud, France's OVHcloud (OVH.PA), Italian cloud service provider Aruba and a Danish association of cloud service providers complained to the European Commission about Microsoft's cloud practices. read more

Microsoft was taking the first step, but not the last, to address the concerns, Smith told a conference organised by think tank Bruegel in Brussels.

He recounted the ""extraordinary defeat"" that Microsoft had faced in a challenge to the EU antitrust body in 2007 that had forced it to embrace change ""which is a lot more fun than like knocking heads"".

Microsoft wants to listen and act on the complaints, Smith said.

""It really starts by giving more options to European cloud providers. So if there's a company that has a data center but wants to run solutions in its cloud PBX data center, we're creating more options for them to do so with our software, because that's what they've been asking for,"" he said.

Microsoft will help cloud providers to offer Windows and Office directly as part of a complete desktop solution that they can build on, sell and host on their infrastructure.

It will revise licensing deals and allow customers to use their licenses on any European cloud provider delivering services to their own datacenters. Customers will also be allowed to buy licenses just for the virtual environment without the need to buy the physical hardware.

While some cloud service providers lauded the news, others said it was not enough.

""Cloud adoption and the development of European digital capabilities are a priority for the European Union. Microsoft has a unique role to play in supporting this effort,"" the European Cloud Alliance, whose members include Microsoft, said in a statement.

CISPE, which counts world No. 1 cloud service provider Amazon(AMZN.O), OVHCloud and Aruba as its members, dismissed the move and urged the EU antitrust watchdog not to ease up.

""The initiative announced today fails to tackle in any meaningful way the unfair licensing practices at the heart of complaints and concerns among cloud infrastructure service providers and customers across Europe,"" CISPE Secretary General, Francisco Mingorance said in a statement.

""It does nothing to end the anti-competitive tying of productivity suites with cloud infrastructure services,"" he said.

Asked about workplace messaging app Slack's 2020 complaint on Microsoft's tying of its Teams product into its Office productivity suite, Smith said bundling was in a different category, but did not provide details.

129,180,Microsoft,2022-05-18,Market rout throws off math for open deals,"













NEW YORK, May 19 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Stock prices aren’t always reliable measures of how likely deals are to get done. While Twitter (TWTR.N) shares sink on each new broadside read more from putative $44 billion buyer Elon Musk, many companies subject to offers have seen their stocks slide on little news. A tumultuous market means takeover targets’ shares may have further to fall if they’re left at the altar. Even if the odds of a deal going ahead haven’t changed, arbitrageurs need to factor that in.

Look at video-game publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O), awaiting approval for its $69 billion sale read more to Microsoft (MSFT.O). Investors must price in the risk that merger-phobic regulators block the deal. But that risk hasn’t really changed since the tie-up’s announcement, while Activision’s shares have trended downwards. What has changed is the carnage in the stock market.

Here's how the math works. Arbitrage-focused hedge funds look to balance the probability a deal will close – and the payoff they’ll receive if it does – against where a stock would probably trade if the takeover fails. Microsoft is offering $95 per share for Activision. The stock closed at $65.39 before the transaction became public. Assuming Activision fell back to that price if regulators block the merger, its closing price of $78.54 on Tuesday implies that the market assigns only a 44% chance of closing.

But Activision shares would drop a lot further if the deal breaks, because technology stocks have fallen since the January announcement. The MVIS Global Video Gaming & eSports Index is down nearly 19% since then. Assuming Activision’s shares would have tracked the index, the implied probability of the deal closing is 61%, according to a new Breakingviews calculator. On the day of the announcement, Activision’s closing price of $82.31 implied a 57% likelihood of success. In other words, the implied chances of the deal going ahead have slightly improved.

Not so for Twitter. Even considering the nearly 25% decline in the Dow Jones Internet Index since just before Musk made his investment in the company public ahead of announcing his $54.20-a-share offer, its Tuesday closing price of $38.32 implies only around 36% odds that the deal will close. That may even be optimistic: One possibility is that Twitter accepts a lower bid. But spreads have widened on a bevy of deals with blue-chip buyers that should follow a clear-cut path, like SailPoint Technologies’ (SAIL.N) $6.9 billion sale to Thoma Bravo. Those moves may be about increasing risks to investors, rather than the deals themselves.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Activision Blizzard agreed to sell itself to Microsoft on Jan. 18 for $95 per share in a $69 billion all-cash deal. Shares in the video-game publisher have persistently traded below the deal price, partly reflecting the risk that U.S. antitrust authorities will not approve the transaction. The gap between Activision’s trading price and the deal price has widened, from as little as 8.5% on the day of the deal’s announcement to around 17% on May 17.

- Since the two companies agreed to a deal, the MVIS Global Video Gaming & eSports Index is down almost 19%.

- Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk reached an agreement to acquire Twitter on April 25 for $54.20 a share, in a deal that values the social network at $44 billion. The billionaire has since expressed doubt about Twitter’s business, saying that the deal is on hold until the number of bots on the service can be independently verified.

JERUSALEM, May 18 (Reuters) - Masterschool, an Israeli network of tech career-training schools, said on Wednesday it had raised $100 million in an early stage funding round led by venture firm Group 11.

Target Global, Pitango Ventures, Dynamic Loop Capital, Ronald Cohen, and other strategic investors had also contributed to the financing, Masterschool said.

It added that the funding would be used to scale up its network, rapidly increasing the number of schools to provide the opportunities ""that come with a tech career to an ever-widening group of people"".

Masterschool said students only had to pay for the courses, which lasted six to nine months, after they had been hired.

Since its founding in 2019, graduates from dozens of Masterschool schools have been hired by some of the largest tech companies, including Google, Microsoft, and Intel, the firm said.

TOKYO/DUBAI, May 18 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) has taken a 5.01% stake in Nintendo Co Ltd (7974.T) as the sovereign wealth fund increases its exposure to the Japanese video gaming industry.

The investment in the Kyoto-based group company was made for investment purposes, a filing said, and comes as PIF has also taken stakes in video game companies Nexon (3659.T), Capcom (9697.T) and Koei Tecmo (3635.T).

PIF, which is chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is an anchor investor in SoftBank Group Corp's (9984.T) $100 billion Vision Fund but also invests independently as part of the prince's plans to transform the country's economy.

The sovereign wealth fund, which manages more than $600 billion, took a stake in Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O), the ""Call of Duty"" publisher which Microsoft said in January it would buy.

PIF has launched its own video game and e-sports company, Savvy Gaming. read more

WASHINGTON, May 23 (Reuters) - Videogame publisher Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) enforced a social media policy that conflicted with workers’ rights and illegally threatened staff in the policy's enforcement, a U.S. government agency said on Monday.

Unless Activision settles, the Los Angeles-based regional director of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) will issue a complaint, a spokesperson of the NLRB said in a statement.

The NLRB had been looking into allegations brought to the agency last September by labor union Communications Workers of America (CWA).

The announcement came on the same day that a small group of Activision employees at a Wisconsin studio that works on the popular ""Call of Duty"" franchise voted to join the CWA. read more

The union has increasingly focused in recent years on organizing non-union workers in the tech and video game industries.

The ""Call of Duty"" videogame maker said on Monday the allegations were false.

""These allegations are false. Employees may and do talk freely about these workplace issues without retaliation, and our social media policy expressly incorporates employees' NLRA rights,"" a company spokesperson said.

""Our social media policy explicitly says that it ‘does not restrict employees from engaging in the communication of information protected by law, including for example, rights of employees in the United States protected by the National Labor Relations Act,'"" the spokesperson said.

In recent months, Activision Blizzard workers have banded together to try to influence the company's future, including staging a walkout and circulating a petition calling for the removal of Chief Executive Officer Bobby Kotick. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) announced plans to acquire Activision in January. read more

The company's labor issues come as it also faces claims from a California civil rights agency of widespread discrimination against female employees. Activision has denied wrongdoing and said the agency did not thoroughly investigate workers' discrimination complaints before suing.

Activision had faced similar claims from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which it settled in March for $18 million. read more

May 23 (Reuters) - A small group of Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) workers voted for unionizing at a studio that works on the popular ""Call of Duty"" franchise, the second victory in a push to organize the video gaming industry.

Employees in the quality assurance department at Raven Software in Middleton, Wisconsin, voted 19-3 for joining the Communications Workers of America (CWA), according to a tally by U.S. National Labor Relation Board (NLRB) officials on Monday.

The union must still bargain and reach a deal on a contract with Activision. The vote will not have to be re-certified if Microsoft (MSFT.O) succeeds in its plan to acquire Activision, according to the CWA.

“We respect and believe in the right of all employees to decide whether or not to support or vote for a union. We believe that an important decision that will impact the entire Raven Software studio of roughly 350 people should not be made by 19 Raven employees,” Activision said in a statement following the vote.

Wisconsin is a right-to-work state, meaning any worker can choose not to be a union member.

Employees are speaking up at Activision following multiple accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct. They have walked out in protest of the company response to the allegations and layoffs of quality assurance testers. Employees have circulated a petition calling for the removal of Chief Executive Officer Bobby Kotick.

In the broader market, workers are also becoming more vocal and active about better pay and working conditions.

""Employees in this sector tend to be overworked and underpaid and treated as disposable, which probably goes against the public image that people have of tech workers,"" said John Logan, a professor of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University adding that many feel the only way to gain respect is by unionizing.

In December, Vodeo became the first video game studio in North America with workers to secure union representation.

Employees at an Amazon (AMZN.O) warehouse in Staten Island, New York, recently voted to unionize and workers at an Apple (AAPL.O) store in Atlanta filed a petition for a union election. read more

Workers at more than 58 U.S. Starbucks cafes have elected to join Workers United, while at least four stores voted against the union, out of more than roughly 262 that have sought to hold elections since last August.

""There's certainly a huge amount of energy and optimism, particularly amongst young workers at the moment,"" Logan said.

In Wisconsin, the organizers called for a healthier work environment with realistic development timelines, appropriate compensation and career development opportunities in an industry where quality assurance is undervalued, according to the organizers official Twitter account.

The number of ballots received was 24 of 28 eligible voters. There were two challenged ballots, which is not enough to change the outcome of the vote.

""Other workers in the video game industry will be excited and inspired by the success of the Raven Software workers in forming their union. We urge Activision to respect their decision and commit to bargaining a fair contract,"" said CWA Communications Director Beth Allen said in a statement before the vote.

Summary Companies JPMorgan Chase upbeat interest income outlook boosts banks

Broadcom shares fall on potential VMware buyout

Indexes up: Dow 1.98%, S&P 1.86%, Nasdaq 1.59%















NEW YORK, May 23 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended higher on Monday as gains from banks and a rebound in market-leading tech shares supported a broad-based rally following Wall Street's longest streak of weekly declines since the dotcom bust more than 20 years ago.

All three major U.S. stock indexes advanced between 1.6% and 2.0%, with the heftiest boost coming from rebounding megacap tech stocks Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

Interest rate-sensitive banks (.SPXBK) jumped 5.1% after the largest U.S. lender, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) raised its current year interest income outlook. read more

JPMorgan Chase's stock surged 6.2%.

""It feels like a relief rally more than a fundamental change in investor sentiments,"" said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors, in New York. ""Investors as a whole feel like there's another shoe to drop and they're probably right in the short term.""

On Friday, the S&P 500 closed 18.7% below its record closing high reached on Jan. 3. If the benchmark index closes 20% or more below that record, it will confirm it has been in a bear market since then.

Markets have been roiled in recent weeks by worries about persistently high inflation and aggressive attempts by the Federal Reserve to rein it in while the global economy copes with fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""Today it would appear the market is less fearful over the inflation factor and the Fed being able to orchestrate a soft landing so to speak,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.

But ""the bias is still to the downside,"" Carlson added.

Economic indicators this week might lend further support to the notion that inflation peaked in March, and show whether high prices have hurt consumer spending power.

All 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 ended the session green, with financials (.SPSY) enjoying the largest percentage gain, advancing 3.2%

First-quarter reporting season is nearly a wrap, with 474 of companies in the S&P 500 having posted results. Of those, 78% beat expectations, according to Refinitiv.

Looking ahead, current quarter pre-announcements are generally pessimistic, with 59 negative projections and 32 positive, compared with the year-ago quarter's 37 negative and 52 positive, per Refinitiv.

135,524,Microsoft,2022-05-24,IT firm Softline expects turnover to decline in major market Russia,"













May 24 (Reuters) - London-listed IT firm Softline (SFTLq.L) said on Tuesday turnover in its major market, Russia, would likely shrink from April to June due to ongoing uncertainty, but was confident of double-digit growth elsewhere.

Reporting results for the full year ended March 31, Softline, which provides digital solutions, hardware and cloud services, said turnover grew 22% year-on-year to $2.2 billion in reported currency.

Softline, which works closely with Microsoft (MSFT.O), withdrew its business outlook in March, but on Tuesday gave guidance for the three months from April to June, saying it expected year-over-year turnover growth of at least 15%.

""In Russia, the company expects growth to decline at least mid-single digits year-over-year based on the continued uncertainty in the market,"" it said, adding that it expected the business, including its Russia operations, to deliver positive core earnings.

Headquartered in London and operating in 60 countries, Softline's primary market is Russia, accounting for 51% of turnover for the full year, the company said.

Softline has been at pains to downplay its connection to Russia, especially in the wake of broad-ranging Western sanctions on Russian companies over Moscow's stated ""special operation"" in Ukraine.

""Softline Holding PLC does not consider itself to be an entity owned by or acting on behalf or at the direction of a person connected with Russia,"" it said in early March.

Russian founder Igor Borovikov is a tax resident of Portugal.

Softline this month said its Russian and non-Russian businesses now differ significantly in operations, priorities, and go-to-market strategies and it is exploring options to adjust the group's assets and ownership structure.

Softline on Tuesday denied a report by Forbes Russia on Monday that Softline was planning to cut salaries at its Russian operations by 25% and adopt more performance-based targets.

Chief Operating Officer Sergey Chernovolenko said all companies operating in Russia should be adjusting their approaches in the current circumstances and said staff numbers were not being reduced.

The company said it planned to reorganise one of the divisions in the Russian office in the near future.

""In some divisions of the Russian office, directly or indirectly related to sales, in order to strengthen the focus on results, it is planned to change the structure of employees' income, in which the bonus part will increase,"" a spokesperson said.

BRUSSELS, May 24 (Reuters) - U.S. business software maker Oracle Corp (ORCL.N)is set to gain unconditional EU antitrust clearance for its $28.3 billion acquisition of U.S. healthcare IT company Cerner Corp (CERN.O),three people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

Oracle announced the deal, its biggest ever, in December last year. It will give it access to a trove of data and could attract more healthcare clients to its cloud platform. read more

Cerner's data can help Oracle train and improve the software maker's artificial intelligence-based cloud services. The company, whose software traditionally ran in its customers' data centers, has started shifting its service to cloud computing providers.

The European Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by June 1, and Oracle declined to comment.

Tech giants such as Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) have ramped up investments in the healthcare sector, spurred by demand for cloud-based solutions during the pandemic.

137,615,Microsoft,2022-05-25,S.Korean Naver's robotics ambitions challenged by 5G on-the-ground realities,"[1/5] A robot using 5G network moves during a demonstration at the Naver 1784 company in Seongnam, South Korea, May 13, 2022. REUTERS/ Heo Ran















SEONGNAM, South Korea, May 25 (Reuters) - On weekdays, South Korean tech company Naver Corp's (035420.KS) new headquarters near Seoul resembles a scene straight out of a science-fiction movie, with some 40 robots ambling across floors and delivering parcels and Starbucks coffee to humans.

The Rookies, as the robots are called, weave their way between people and even take a see-through elevator reserved for them to traverse the building's 28 floors. Crucially for Naver, the Rookies' brains are stored in the cloud and connected to the robots via a private superfast 5G network.

While the robots seem to be doing their jobs well, senior Naver executives are cautious on the commercial future of the fledgling robot business, on which the company has already invested $550 million, as 5G technology presents challenges.

""This will be a long-term task,"" Seok Sang-ok, CEO of R&D arm Naver Labs, which leads the robots project, told Reuters, declining to make any financial forecasts for the business.

Naver is South Korea's dominant search portal operator and one of its 10 most valuable listed companies with a market capitalisation of $35 billion. It has been making a push into 5G, becoming the country's first non-telecoms company to be allowed to run a locally licensed 5G network in December.

Naver's cautious outlook for the robots business underscores the challenges companies face in turning innovative ideas that 5G has promised into commercial successes.

These include regulatory hurdles involving new services like autonomous driving, patchy network rollouts and incremental upgrades in technologies.

And even in a technologically advanced country such as South Korea, Asia's 5G pioneer which launched a fifth-generation mobile network in 2019, demand for the service has remained muted and telcos have been reluctant to invest the massive sums needed to ramp up connection speeds to support services like autonomous driving. read more

COST ADVANTAGE?

While Naver's robots currently perform basic functions and their reliability is being tested in comparatively controlled settings, Naver executives are banking on its affordability as a USP for wider use.

Naver declined to disclose the robots' price, but said the removal of the central processing unit and graphics processing unit from the robot and keeping its ""brain"" in the cloud can reduce a unit's cost by more than $1,500.

""5G's low latency is the key to ditching computers inside robots so it can access large computing power unlimited by robot size,"" said Seok.

Naver plans to increase the number of robots to 100 this year and also enable them carry out set-up and maintenance work at its massive data centre that will be completed in 2023. The centre will span 300,000 square metres and be able to operate at least 100,000 servers, matching the scale of Microsoft or Apple's largest data centres, according to the company.

""5G is a network with many advantages, but it has to be optimised for robots instead of phones. No one can do it, but we are doing it,"" said Naver Labs' Won Choong-lyol in the interview.

138,352,Microsoft,2022-05-25,Qualcomm CEO sees growth in high-end phones even if economy slows,"













DAVOS, Switzerland, May 25 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) CEO Cristiano Amon sees growth for the chip supplier as consumers increasingly want ""better phones,"" he said in an interview on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum, even as talk about an economic slowdown dominates the event in the Swiss ski town of Davos.

""Qualcomm has redefined its mobile strategy to be focused on premium and high-tier, and we’re winning share in a flat market,"" Amon said. ""For example, with devices such as the Samsung Galaxy, we had a 40% share and now we have in excess of 75%.""

Amon said the market for smartphones is ""mature,"" limiting growth. Risks to the global economy have topped the concerns of the world's business leaders, policy makers and academics at the annual Davos gathering, with some citing the threat of a worldwide recession. read more

Amon said that throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the usefulness of smartphones continued to increase, with greater reliance for Zoom meetings at work and school and for staying in touch with family.

""People are looking to have better phones, with more capabilities"" Amon said. ""Those are things that may keep the mobile market stable even in the face of inflation and with the risk of a slowdown.""

In April, Qualcomm forecast third-quarter revenue above analyst expectations. read more

Qualcomm's technology powers augmented and virtual reality devices, including those made by Facebook owner Meta Platforms (FB.O), Amon said, adding that Qualcomm's relationship with Facebook is ""expanding.""

""Augmented reality could be as big as phones,"" he said.

Qualcomm already has partnerships with Microsoft Inc (MSFT.O) and TikTok for virtual and augmented reality devices, and there are more set to be announced, Amon said.

May 25 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) will raise the starting pay for its U.S. employees, the iPhone maker said on Wednesday, as companies face a tight labor market and a surge in unionization efforts amid rising inflation.

The starting pay for the company's U.S. team members will rise to $22 per hour, or higher based upon the market, a 45% jump from 2018 levels, Apple said in a statement to Reuters.

""This year as part of our annual performance review process, we're increasing our overall compensation budget,"" a company spokesperson said.

Apple has informed some workers their annual reviews would be advanced by three months and the new pay will take effect in early July, the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the changes in compensation, said.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for further details on the compensation changes.

Cupertino, California-based Apple is known for its reticent culture, but last year some current and former workers began criticizing the company's working conditions online.

In April, workers at Apple's Atlanta store filed a petition to hold a union election, seeking to become the company's first U.S. store to unionize amid a wave of labor activity at other major firms. read more

Google (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) are among other tech companies that have revised performance reviews or adjusted pay this year as they fight to retain workers.

140,731,Microsoft,2022-05-26,Chipmaker Broadcom to buy VMware in $61 bln deal,"













May 26 (Reuters) - Broadcom Inc (AVGO.O) said on Thursday it will acquire cloud computing company VMware Inc (VMW.N) in a $61 billion cash-and stock deal, the chipmaker's biggest and boldest bid to diversify its business into enterprise software.

The acquisition is the second biggest announced globally so far this year, trailing only Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) $68.7 billion deal to buy video game maker Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O).

The offer of $142.50 in cash or 0.2520 of a Broadcom share for each VMware stock represents a premium of nearly 49% to the stock's last close before talks of the deal were first reported on May 22. Broadcom will also assume $8 billion of VMware's net debt.

The chipmaker's shares closed up 3.5% and VMware rose 3.1%.

Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan, who built his company into one of the world's biggest chipmakers through acquisitions, is now bringing his dealmaking playbook to the software sector.

In one fell swoop, the deal will almost triple Broadcom's software-related revenue to about 45% of its total sales.

Broadcom will instantly be validated as a major software player with the acquisition of VMware, Futurum Research analyst Daniel Newman said.

""Having something like VMware ... will have a significant number of doors open that their current portfolio probably doesn't open for them,"" Newman added.

The deal comes at a time when there is an increased push by the Biden administration for more competition in all sectors ranging from agriculture to technology.

""The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) could be concerned Broadcom will use the acquisition to potentially bundle services or raise prices,"" Josh White, assistant professor of finance at Vanderbilt University, said.

""Ultimately, the FTC will want to understand if this consolidation would impact overall competition and prices, especially in this inflationary environment,"" White, also a former financial economist for the Securities and Exchange Commission, said.

The agreement is also a coup for Dell Technologies Inc (DELL.N) Chief Executive Michael Dell, who spun VMware out of the computer maker last year.

Michael Dell owns a 40% stake in VMware, while his financial backer Silver Lake, a private equity firm, owns 10%. They have both agreed to vote in favor of the deal.

Broadcom has already got commitments from a consortium of banks for $32 billion in debt funding. VMware, which said the offer was unsolicited, will be allowed to solicit offers from rival bidders for 40 days as part of the agreement.

If VMware picks another offer after this time lapses, the firm will have to pay Broadcom $1.5 billion as break-up fee.

However, if it decides to pick another offer before this period ends, a termination fee of $750 million must be paid.

Both the companies also reported quarterly results, with Broadcom forecasting better-than-expected revenue for the third quarter, while VMware suspended its full-year outlook due to the pending acquisition.

Broadcom's board also authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $10 billion.

BID TO DIVERSIFY

Broadcom's pivot into software started after its attempt to acquire mobile chip giant Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) was blocked by former U.S. President Donald Trump in 2018 on national security grounds.

Since then Broadcom took over business software firm CA Technologies Inc for $18.9 billion and acquired Symantec Corp's security division for $10.7 billion. It also explored acquiring analytical software company SAS Institute Inc, but did not proceed with a bid.

Broadcom then went on to slash costs at the acquired businesses. It cut the sales and marketing budgets of the CA and Symantec businesses from about 29% of their revenue to 7%.

VMware is dominant in the so-called virtualization software market, that allows corporate customers to run multiple applications on their servers.

This business has started to slow as companies have found new tools to operate through cloud computing, pushing VMware to seek new offerings, including through a partnership with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).

Broadcom doesn't have a track record of spending big on research and development, Keith Townsend, analyst at advisory firm CTO Advisor, said.

This could bode poorly for the launch of new products at VMware, Townsend, who also had a brief stint with VMware as an enterprise data center architect, said.

""As I talk to customers, they're in desperate need for innovation from companies like VMware.""

Summary Companies PCE price index indicates inflation peaked in March

Dell climbs on strong Q1 results

Gap, American Eagle Outfitters cut profit forecasts

Indexes jump: Dow 1.76%, S&P 2.47%, Nasdaq 3.33%















NEW YORK, May 27 (Reuters) - Wall Street closed sharply higher on Friday as signs of peaking inflation and consumer resiliency sent investors into the long holiday weekend with growing optimism that the Federal Reserve will be able to tighten monetary policy without tipping the economy into recession.

All three major U.S. stock indexes brought a decisive end to their longest weekly losing streaks in decades.

The S&P and the Nasdaq suffered seven consecutive weekly declines, the longest since the end of the dot-com bust, while the blue-chip Dow's eight-week selloff was its longest since 1932.

""The market has now discounted a lot of the negative news, a lot (of which) hit all at once,"" said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at GLOBALT in Atlanta. ""Now we have absorbed that news and the actions the Fed is going to take, and we’re wrapping up earnings season.""

""The signs are lining up and the boxes are being checked that we expect to develop when the market starts to form a bottom,"" Buchanan added.

During the S&P's seven straight weeks of losses, from its April 1 to May 20 Friday closes, the bellwether index shed 14.2% of its value and threatened to confirm it has been in a bear market since its Jan. 3 record closing high.

But this week, in a sharp reversal, the S&P reclaimed much of that lost ground by soaring 6.6%, its best week since November 2020.

""It was inevitable that the losing streak would end,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist Ingalls & Snyder in New York. ""Corrections and bear markets are followed by 'up' markets.""

Generally upbeat earnings guidance and solid economic indicators have fueled hopes that the Fed's hawkish maneuvers to contain decades-high inflation will not cool the economy into contraction.

Data released on Friday showed better-than-expected consumer spending and appeared to confirm that inflation, which has dampened corporate earnings guidance and weighed on investor sentiment, has peaked. read more

This, combined with the minutes from the central bank's most recent policy meeting, which reaffirmed its commitment to rein in spiking prices while remaining responsive to economic data, helped boost risk appetite.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 575.77 points, or 1.76%, to 33,212.96, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 100.4 points, or 2.47%, to 4,158.24 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 390.48 points, or 3.33%, to 12,131.13.

All 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 advanced amid light trading, with consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD), tech (.SPLRCT) and real estate (.SPLRCR) notching the biggest percentage gains.

Shares of Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) provided the strongest lift.

First-quarter earnings season is largely in the bag, with 488 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 77% have beaten consensus expectations, according to Refinitiv.

Ulta Beauty (ULTA.O) gained 12.5% following its upbeat quarterly earnings report.

Computer hardware company Dell Technologies Inc (DELL.N) surged 12.9% after beating quarterly profit and revenue estimates. read more

Trading volumes were light ahead of the long weekend, with U.S. stock markets closed on Monday in observance of Memorial Day.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.92 billion shares, compared with the 13.13 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 6.49-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 4.13-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 3 new 52-week highs and 29 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 40 new highs and 84 new lows.

142,425,Microsoft,2022-05-27,First steps in reforming global health emergency rules agreed at WHO meeting - sources,"Law firms Un Cha Kim Follow















GENEVA (Reuters) - Countries have agreed to an initial U.S.-led push to reform of the rules around disease outbreaks, known as the International Health Regulations, after early opposition from Africa and others was overcome this week, sources told Reuters on Friday.

The amendments, once confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO) assembly, are one of a handful of concrete outcomes from a meeting seen as a once-in-a-generation chance for the U.N. health agency to strengthen its role following some 15 million deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The reform sought by Washington and backed by others like Japan and the European Union is a first step in a broader reform of the IHR, which set out countries' legal obligations around disease outbreaks, expected to take up to two years.

Earlier this week, African countries and others voiced opposition to the approach but three diplomatic sources said this was overcome through changes to the proposal's wording.

""A compromise was reached in the corridors last night,"" said one of the sources who was not authorised to speak about the negotiations publicly.

The new proposal, yet to be formally approved by the assembly, now refers to steps to address ""equity"" issues - a key issue for developing countries including many in Africa which are seeking guarantees about the sharing of vaccines and treatments for future health emergencies.

The initial changes foresee a change to Article 59 that would speed up the implementation of reforms from 24 to 12 months.

Other U.S. proposals yet to be negotiated by the WHO's 194 members include the possible deployment of expert teams to contamination sites and the creation of a new compliance committee to monitor the rules' future implementation.

Russia has also submitted IHR reform proposals that have not yet been made public.

He joins DocuSign as chief legal officer, on the heels of general counsel departure















(Reuters) - DocuSign Inc has hired a new legal chief, bringing on former Workday Inc general counsel Jim Shaughnessy.

The electronic signature software company said Thursday that Shaughnessy, who most recently held a corporate affairs advisory role at Workday, will join as chief legal officer.

San Francisco-based DocuSign last week lost its general counsel, Trâm Phi, to enterprise software company Databricks Inc.

Shaughnessy was Workday's general counsel for about eight years until September 2019, according to his LinkedIn bio. He moved into corporate affairs roles as former Microsoft lawyer Rich Sauer took over as general counsel.

Workday, an enterprise management software company, did not immediately respond to a request Friday for comment on Shaughnessy's departure.

Shaughnessy previously held law department leadership positions at Orbitz Worldwide Inc, Lenovo Group Ltd and PeopleSoft Inc and Hewlett Packard, the company said.

DocuSign is a publicly traded company that helps businesses manage agreements electronically.

The company's leadership was hit with a shareholder derivative lawsuit last week alleging they misled investors about demand for its services in the long term as COVID-19 pandemic restrictions eased.

Brian Kelly, vice president and deputy general counsel at DocuSign, said in a statement the new case ""copies from allegations"" in a securities class action filed last year, ""which we believe lack merit and will defend against vigorously.""

144,181,Microsoft,2022-05-31,JPM says Meta will become Broadcom's next billion-dollar customer,"













May 31 (Reuters) - Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) will use Broadcom Inc's (AVGO.O) custom chips to build its metaverse hardware, becoming the chipmaker's next billion-dollar ASIC customer, analysts at J.P. Morgan said on Tuesday.

ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) chips will drive $2 billion to $2.5 billion in revenue for Broadcom this year, helped by its deals with Meta and partnerships with Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), the analysts said.

""We believe these wins are primarily at 5 nanometre and 3 nanometre and will be used to power Meta's metaverse hardware architecture that it will deploy over the next few years,"" analyst Harlan Sur said.

Meta is investing heavily in the metaverse - a virtual space where people interact, work and play - by adding new features to hardware devices that serve as access points to the virtual world.

Sur added that Meta will emerge as Broadcom's next $1 billion-a-year ASIC customer over the next three to four years after Google.

ASICs are designed to perform hyper-specific tasks, including in AI and machine learning, efficiently.

Broadcom and Google have co-developed Google's custom chip used for machine learnings tasks since 2016 and the brokerage estimates this to be worth over $1.3 billion in 2022.

Meta is developing a range of hardware products for the metaverse that include smart glasses and virtual reality headsets, and has even opened its first physical store where shoppers can try out these devices and other gadgets. read more

""Near-term ASIC program pipeline is strong as we believe Broadcom will be ramping Meta/Facebook and Microsoft ASICs this year,"" Sur added.

Broadcom's semiconductor solutions business, which makes custom chips, contributed more than 70% to the company's nearly $27.5 billion revenue in 2021.

145,415,Microsoft,2022-05-31,"Salesforce sees robust profit, expects little impact from inflation","













May 31 (Reuters) - Salesforce Inc (CRM.N) raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast and said it did not see any material impact from the uncertain broader economic environment, sending the enterprise software firm's shares up about 8% in extended trading.

The company said on Tuesday there was strong demand for its software from companies looking to improve efficiencies and incorporate modern-day work-flows, including hybrid work, despite a four-decade high inflation and tapering consumer demand.

Shares of the San-Francisco-based company rose 7.7% to $172.50, after plummeting about 37% this year as investors moved out of growth stocks on a series of bad news including high inflation in the United States and the Ukraine crisis.

Shares of rivals Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), which have also forecast an upbeat year, have fallen between 18% and 19% this year.

""Macroeconomic or geopolitical headwinds may show up sooner or later, but Salesforce is well positioned to capitalize on enterprise spending on digital transformation, and the company has a fairly resilient model,"" SMBC Nikko Securities analyst Steven Koenig said.

Salesforce increased its adjusted profit estimate for the fiscal year ending January 2023 to $4.75 per share from its prior forecast of $4.63.

The profit forecast raise is a big positive as it's a key area of investor focus, especially in the current market environment, said William Blair & Company analyst Arjun Bhatia.

However, foreign exchange headwinds forced the company to marginally lower its revenue forecast for the year to $31.7 billion to $31.8 billion, from its earlier forecast of $32 billion to $32.1 billion.

Revenue in the first quarter ending April 30 rose 24% to $7.41 billion from a year earlier, above analysts' average estimate of $7.38 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Net income fell to $28 million from $469 million.

NEW YORK, May 31 (Reuters) - Dealmakers at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett are riding high.

They worked on the three biggest mergers and acquisitions (M&A) announced so far this year, pushing Simpson Thacher to the No. 1 spot of the U.S. dealmaking league tables for law firms for the first time in 17 years.

Veteran M&A lawyer Alan Klein, who has advised Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on every major acquisition of the past decade, landed the biggest deal announced so far this year when the technology giant agreed to buy video game maker Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) in January for $68.7 billion.

Klein was also brought in to advise Twitter Inc's (TWTR.N) board of directors alongside another law firm, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, when Elon Musk negotiated a $44-billion deal last month to acquire the social media company.

Klein's Simpson Thacher partner Atif Azher, who has advised on numerous large deals - including Dell Technologies Inc's (DELL.N) $67-billion acquisition of data-storage company EMC, and Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) $68-billion purchase of pharmaceutical peer Wyeth - advised private equity firm Silver Lake earlier this month on the $61-billion sale of cloud software VMware Inc (VMW.N) to chip maker Broadcom Inc (AVGO.O).

""This is obviously incredibly fortuitous and impressive to have been involved with three deals north of $40 billion, two of them over $60 billion, in the first five months of the year. To have those deals in the course of any one full year would be extraordinary,"" said Klein.

While Simpson Thacher has consistently ranked among the top ten most-active law firms in U.S. M&A, it has not finished a year as No 1 since 2005. It is now on track to do so; it has advised on deals worth $230 billion so far this year, more than any other law firm. It is trailed by Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, which has advised on $193 billion worth of deals.

Simpson Thacher partner Anthony Vernace, who worked on the Activision and Twitter deals alongside Klein, said the firm's decades-long relationships with the likes of Silver Lake and Microsoft was key to edging out other top-drawer U.S. law firms for the lead roles on those transactions.

""Each of these three transactions represents the culmination of the kind of broad base experience and client relationship strength we've cultivated and nurtured over a long period of time,"" Vernace said.

147,412,Microsoft,2022-06-01,Navigation firm TomTom to cut jobs as it automates mapmaking,"













June 1 (Reuters) - TomTom (TOM2.AS) will slash hundreds of jobs due to improvements it has made in automating its mapmaking activities, the Dutch digital navigation company said on Wednesday, adding that the cuts would amount to around a tenth of its global workforce.

""Regrettably, this will have an intended impact on approximately 500 employees in our Maps unit,"" the company said in a statement. ""The full assessment of the financial implications of the reset of the Maps unit is ongoing.""

ING analyst Marc Hesselink estimated that the cuts would hit relatively lower-paid workers, adding that savings and restructuring charges for the company should balance out around 30 million euros ($32 million) each.

""Over recent years TomTom has been working towards the holy grail of a fully automated map-making process,"" Hesselink said in a research note, adding that an investment drive launched this year appears to have been successful.

Chief Executive Harold Goddijn said higher levels of automation would build better, broader maps enabling it to address a wider market across its carmaker and tech customers.

TomTom shares rose slightly in Amsterdam during morning trade, but the stock has lost more than a quarter of its value since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

The company, whose clients range from Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Renault (RENA.PA) to (UBER.N) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), has been hit by pandemic-caused supply chain shortages which forced automakers around the globe to slash production.

It had reaffirmed its cash and sales forecasts in April, when it said it had seen limited immediate effects from Russia's war in Ukraine as some factories belonging to carmakers and suppliers in the country remained in operation.

TomTom said it would provide an update as it announces its quarterly financial results on July 15.

BENTONVILLE, Ark., June 1 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (WMT.N) shareholders on Wednesday struck down by an overwhelming margin an activist investor-led proposal asking the retailer to produce a report assessing the impact on its employees if the U.S. Supreme Court rolls back abortion rights.

The proposal, made by Clean Yield Asset management on behalf of activist investor Julie Kalish, urged Walmart's board to detail ""any known and any potential risks and costs to the company caused by enacted or proposed state policies severely restricting reproductive rights"" by the end of the year.

Only 12.9% of the votes cast were in favor of the resolution made at the company's annual general meeting.

The vote was held as corporate America deals with the possibility that the Supreme Court will weaken or overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.

Walmart, the nation's largest retailer operating more than 5,000 stores, hires about 1% of the U.S. private sector workforce, or 1.6 million employees. Women make up nearly 50% of its U.S. workforce.

Nearly 30% of Walmart's stores are located in states with so-called trigger laws that would ban or greatly restrict abortions if Roe v. Wade is overturned, as a leaked draft Supreme Court opinion indicated would occur. Arkansas, where Walmart is based, is one of those states. read more

Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommended that investors vote in favor of the resolution, saying the ""the likelihood that the company's female workforce will be impacted has increased.""

""As an employer in all 50 states, including many where access to reproductive healthcare has already been restricted, and where more restrictions are expected if Roe vs. Wade is overturned, Walmart should consider the impact it will have on its workforce and business,"" a representative for Kalish said during the virtual meeting streamed on the company's website.

The loss of access to reproductive care, including abortions, could prevent employees from remaining in Walmart's workforce and could hurt its ability to recruit workers, the representative added.

Walmart had opposed the proposal, saying it already offers a variety of affordable healthcare options for employees and preparation of a report would be of little value for shareholders, according to a regulatory filing.

Other prominent U.S. companies including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) have announced abortion-related policies including covering expenses for employees who must travel to obtain the procedure - moves that could help them retain workers.

The proposal was one of seven activist-led resolutions voted down on Wednesday that challenged Walmart's policies on various issues including treatment of workers, workplace practices and charitable donations.

About 50% of Walmart's stock is controlled by the Waltons - the family of founder Sam Walton - raising the bar for any effort to win a majority of investor support.

149,0,Microsoft,2022-06-02,Microsoft micromanages tech jitters,"













NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Giant companies tend to be slow and reliable, and profit warnings are rare. So it’s unusual that Microsoft (MSFT.O) decided to alert investors on Thursday that revenue would fall about 1% short of guidance, and earnings per share 2%, because of a strong dollar. The $2 trillion technology giant, whose stock was off just 1.6%, has good reason to handhold investors.

Microsoft often exceeds guidance read more , and lately, tempering expectations has proved wise. Other firms like Amazon.com (AMZN.O) have unpleasantly surprised investors. The $1.2 trillion e-commerce giant’s stock is off by a quarter in the past year while Microsoft is up 7%.

A currency-caused slowdown doesn’t reflect any problems in operations. Still, Microsoft is richly valued relative to historic multiples, at about 9 times estimated revenue over the next 12 months, according to Refinitiv. Five years ago, it was valued at 5 times.

Small changes to its earnings might alarm investors, especially with the Nasdaq Composite Index off 25% in the year-to-date. Future warnings more specifically about the business will be harder to shake off. For now, Microsoft’s micromanaging has softened the blow.(By Robert Cyran)

151,345,Microsoft,2022-06-02,U.S. tech sector sees highest job cuts in May since Dec. 2020- report,"













June 2 (Reuters) - U.S. employers in the technology sector cut nearly nine times more jobs in May than in the first four months of the year as rising inflation and slowing demand force companies to cut corners.

Though overall layoffs in the country reported by global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas on Thursday fell 14.7% in May from April, thanks to strong demand in the labor market, the technology sector cut 4,044 jobs, up from the 459 between January and April.

It is the highest monthly total since December 2020 when tech companies cut as many as 5,253 jobs.

""Many technology startups that saw tremendous growth in 2020, particularly in the real estate, financial, and delivery sectors, are beginning to see a slowdown in users, and coupled with inflation and interest rate concerns, are restructuring their workforces to cut costs,"" said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of challenger, Gray & Christmas.

U.S. tech layoffs and sector performance

The impact of the Ukraine crisis, a four-decade high inflation and rising interest rates has led to forecast cuts by companies such as Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), while others like Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) have slowed hiring to rein in costs.

Fintech companies also announced 268% more job cuts in May than in the first four months of 2022, the report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.

However, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 200,000 for the week ended May 28, the Labor Department said on Thursday. read more

152,334,Microsoft,2022-06-02,South African company helps hang local art in virtual world,"













JOHANNESBURG, June 2 (Reuters) - As South African artist Fhatuwani Mukheli paints a portrait of a woman at his Johannesburg studio, he is creating not only the work before him but also a digital asset destined to adorn a virtual world.

Mukheli uses The Tree, an online marketplace for South African artists to promote and sell their art as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

""There's a virtual world where people are buying land in it,"" said Mukheli, referring to the metaverse, a three-dimensional digital reality that tech giants like Microsoft and Facebook say is the future of the internet.

""People have properties there ... and your art can be on those walls.""

Mukheli's customers receive both the actual canvas and the NFT, while other artists on The Tree sell up to five limited edition NFTs for each piece, akin to digital prints. Mukheli has already made thousands of dollars by using the platform.

""I think it's important as an artist and a creative to always play where the ball is going and not necessarily where it's at,"" said Trevor Stuurman, one of the four other artists currently showcasing their work on The Tree.

Critics say blockchains, digital ledgers used to store information, are not climate-friendly because they guzzle computing power.

The Tree says it saves energy by running on Polygon, a blockchain that uses a fraction of the power, and offsets each transaction by sending money to Greenpop, an environmental organisation that plants trees across Sub-Saharan Africa.

""It's not just about art and artists and the story, it's about making sure that this growth in technology for artists doesn't come at a cost to the planet,"" said Dan Portal, co-founder of The Tree.

153,309,Microsoft,2022-06-02,Apple to improve working hours for retail staff - Bloomberg News,"













June 2 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) will make work schedules for retail staff flexible amid a push towards unionization, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, citing sources.

The company told staff at some stores that scheduling changes will take effect in coming months, the report said, quoting workers. The changes will include extending the minimum time period between shifts to 12 hours from 10 hours.

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Last week, the iPhone maker told Reuters it will raise pay for its U.S. employees to $22 per hour or more. read more

The Cupertino, California-based company, known for its reticent culture, was last year criticized online for its working conditions by some current and former workers.

In April, workers at Apple's Atlanta store filed a petition to hold a union election, seeking to become the company's first U.S. store to unionize amid a wave of labor activity at other major firms. read more

Meanwhile, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Thursday it will not resist unionization efforts by its employees as it recognizes their legal right to choose to form or join a union.

June 2 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) will not resist unionization efforts from its employees, its President Brad Smith said on Thursday, in a sign of growing receptiveness in the tech sector that has been for long unconcerned about organized labor.

Microsoft recognizes employees legal right to choose to form or join a union, although they ""will never need to organize to have a dialogue"" with leaders, Smith said in a blog post on Thursday.

The comment comes against the backdrop of recent agitations from employees at several technology companies.

Last month, a small group of workers in a division of ""Call of Duty"" videogame maker Activision Blizzard, which is being taken over by Microsoft, voted in favor of unionizing. read more

In response, Activision said it believes 19 employees should not be able to make a decision impacting a larger group of its employees.

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) has been long opposed to unionization efforts by its warehouse employees and was last month accused of threatening staff over a union vote.

""Recent unionization campaigns across the country — including in the tech sector — have led us to conclude that inevitably these issues will touch on more businesses, potentially including our own,"" Smith said.

Microsoft does not believe that employees or other stakeholders will benefit by resisting lawful efforts to participate in activities like unionization, he added.

155,3,Microsoft,2022-06-02,"Microsoft warns of forex hit, cuts forecast","













June 2 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Thursday cut its fourth-quarter forecast for profit and revenue, making it the latest U.S. company to warn of a hit from a stronger greenback.

A hawkish Federal Reserve and heightened geopolitical tensions have driven a 14% gain in the dollar against a basket of currencies over the last year, forcing companies such as Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and Procter & Gamble (PG.N) to temper expectations for the rest of the year.

A stronger greenback typically eats into the profits of companies that have sprawling international operations and convert foreign currencies into dollars.

""Software companies including Microsoft have significant operations outside the U.S. and I think Microsoft is being prudent here to get ahead of (market) expectations and be transparent around currency impacts,"" said Steve Koenig, managing director at SMBC Nikko Securities.

Microsoft, which gets about half its revenue from outside the United States, lowered its revenue forecast for all three segments, which include Windows products, cloud services and personal computing.

Corporate hedging activity has increased as more companies try to guard their profits against the impact of currency fluctuations amid surging inflation.

It is common for companies to protect themselves from unexpected forex moves, but the urgency comes after years of muted forex volatility, during which currency fluctuations had limited impact on earnings.

Value of the U.S. dollar rises

The tech giant expects revenue for the quarter to be between $51.94 billion and $52.74 billion, down from its prior range of $52.40 billion to $53.20 billion.

It cut the profit view to between $2.24 and $2.32 per share from a prior expectation of between $2.28 and $2.35 per share. read more

Analysts are forecasting earnings of $2.33 per share on revenue of $52.87 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

The company in April forecast double-digit revenue growth for the next fiscal year, thanks to demand for its office software and cloud services as economies reopen and businesses shift to a hybrid model of allowing staff to alternatively work from office and home.

A Microsoft executive is scheduled to speak at Jefferies Software Conference later in the day.

Shares of the Redmond, Washington-based company were down 2.3% at $266.1.

156,86,Microsoft,2022-06-06,U.S. House speaker Pelosi discloses trades in Apple and Microsoft,"













June 6 (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi disclosed new stock market trades on Monday, showing purchases of options to buy shares of Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

In a periodic transaction report signed last Friday and appearing on the House of Representatives' website on Monday, the senior Democrat disclosed that her husband, financier Paul Pelosi, on May 13 bought Apple call options for between $500,001 and $1 million.

On May 24, he bought more Apple call options, in an amount between $250,001 and $500,000, the disclosure shows. On the same day, Paul Pelosi bought Microsoft call options for as much as $600,000.

Users on social media platforms including Twitter, Reddit, Youtube and TikTok have scrutinized Pelosi's trade disclosures in recent months, believing her position as House Speaker gives her and her husband an edge. read more

A 2012 law makes it illegal for lawmakers to use information from their work in Congress for their personal gain. The law requires them to disclose stock transactions by themselves or family members within 45 days.

Pelosi in January signaled that she might be willing to advance legislation to completely ban stock trading by lawmakers. That was a reversal from her previous position defending lawmakers' right to trade stocks.

Proposals by Democrats in Congress this year to prohibit stock trading by lawmakers have yet to pass.

Pelosi's stock trading performance ranked sixth-best in Congress in 2021, with Republican Congressman Austin Scott leading the way, according to an analysis by Unusual Whales, a service selling financial data.

Paul Pelosi's purchases of Apple and Microsoft options in May followed a steep Wall Street selloff this year related to worries about inflation and rising interest rates.

So far in 2022, Pelosi has filed six transaction reports, disclosing several trades in Apple, the world's most valuable company. She has also disclosed trades in Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), PayPal Holdings (PYPL.O) and other widely held stocks.

The Justice Department ended investigations of stock trades by at least three senators ahead of the 2020 market slump, caused by the coronavirus pandemic, without filing charges.

157,725,Microsoft,2022-06-06,"Lawyer David Boies bills $1,950 hourly in Google case, court filing shows","Summary

Summary Law firms Veteran litigator on plaintiffs' team alleges privacy violations against Google

Google denies it violated any court orders and is contesting lawsuit's claims















(Reuters) - Prominent trial lawyer David Boies is billing $1,950 an hour in a case alleging privacy violations against Alphabet Inc's Google LLC, according to a court filing seeking fees after a judge sanctioned the company for litigation misconduct.

The fee petition filed on June 3 by Boies and other lawyers on the plaintiffs' team came in response to a U.S. magistrate judge's ruling in San Jose, California, federal court last month that said Google failed to timely disclose certain pieces of evidence, including the names of key employees.

The judge said the plaintiffs were entitled to some legal fees as a sanction against Google. The internet search company denied that it had violated any court orders, and it has contested the underlying privacy claims in the proposed class action over its ""Incognito"" web-search setting.

Google's attorneys have urged the judge not to impose any sanctions.

Boies, 81, who founded litigation-focused firm Boies Schiller in 1997, developed his name as a lawyer for the U.S. government in its landmark antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. More recently, Boies faced criticism over his work for Harvey Weinstein, the former Hollywood producer convicted of rape in 2020. Boies' law firm has seen numerous departures to rival firms in recent years.

He did not return messages seeking comment on Monday.

The average hourly rate charged by law firms in 2021 across the market was $533, according to a 2022 report by Thomson Reuters Institute and Georgetown University Law Center. The report said large U.S. firms led the pack amid a ""fairly aggressive"" increase in billing rates.

Well-known lawyer Kannon Shanmugam of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison was billing last year at $1,824 hourly. Recent filings in a bankruptcy case showed Hogan Lovells partner Neal Katyal charging $2,465 hourly.

Jim Jones, senior fellow at Georgetown Law's Center on Ethics and the Legal Profession, called $2,000 hourly rates ""very high"" and would be limited ""to people who were right at the top of their game and major rainmakers.""

The underlying lawsuit was filed in 2020 and alleges Google invaded the privacy of web users who were browsing sites while in ""private"" mode. The complaint said Google had secretly collected information from those users of the company's ""Incognito"" browsing mode.

A Google spokesperson did not immediately comment on Monday, and a lawyer for Google at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

The plaintiffs' firms, which also include Susman Godfrey and Morgan & Morgan, are seeking more than $1.07 million in fees and costs for their work drafting certain court filings and preparing for a hearing.

The case is Brown v Google LLC, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 4:20-cv-03664.

For Brown: Mark Mao of Boies Schiller Flexner; Bill Carmody of Susman Godfrey; and John Yanchunis of Morgan & Morgan

For Google: Andrew Schapiro of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan

158,380,Microsoft,2022-06-06,Meituan is having its cake and eating it too,"













HONG KONG, June 6 (Reuters Breakingviews) - China’s technology companies need not sacrifice growth for profitability. The $142 billion Meituan (3690.HK) reported operating profit in its core food delivery business jumped 41% year-on-year to 1.6 billion yuan ($241 million) in the three months to March, partly thanks to an easing subsidy war with rivals. At the same time, the company grew annual users by over a fifth to 693 million. E-commerce giant Alibaba (9988.HK), , which also has a competing food delivery app, grew users by just 2% over the same period.

That Meituan is winning over customers without having to splurge on marketing is a promising sign its food delivery unit, which accounted for 52% of revenue, is getting healthier. Operating margins in the quarter increased to 6.5%, compared to 5.4% in the same period last year. Meituan’s Hong Kong shares surged 8% on Monday; the stock is up by a third over the past three months.

Executives have flagged takeout orders will “materially decelerate” in the second quarter, as tough Covid-19 lockdowns across Shanghai and other major cities bite. And it’s still racking up huge losses in new ventures like groceries. Still, Meituan is proving to investors it can grow while delivering profit. (By Yawen Chen)

159,812,Microsoft,2022-06-06,Apple dives deeper into autos with software for car dashboard,"













CUPERTINO, Calif., June 6 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Monday announced it would more deeply integrate its software into the core driving systems of cars, while the iPhone maker rolled out a slew of features for payments and business collaboration and a pair of new laptops.

The announcements at Apple's annual developer conference showed a company that was once an outsider working its way firmly into the mainstream of nearly every screen in day-to-day life. read more

The company whose late 1990s turnaround meant branding itself for rebels and troublemakers spent Monday talking up how to use iPads to collaborate on business presentations and how its software will eventually help display fuel economy on car dashboards. Notably absent were any hints of Apple's expected next big product, a mixed-reality headset that can overlay digital objects on a view of the real world. Hopeful fans got only a few tidbits of new augmented reality technology at a technical talk.

And Apple announced Apply Pay Later, a service that lets users make interest-free installments. The business, which will work over the MasterCard Inc (MA.N) network wherever Apple Pay is accepted, puts Apple in direction competition with payment providers like Affirm Holdings Inc (AFRM.O) and PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O).

But mostly Apple doubled down on existing products. A MacBook Air laptop was redesigned around a new M2 silicon processor, which it says is 35% faster than the previous M1 chip. The new laptop will be 2.7 pounds (1.2 kg) and have a 1080p high-definition camera to provide better images on video calls. The MacBook Air will start at $1,199, Apple announced at its WWDC 2022 conference.

The M2 chip will also power the 13-inch MacBook Pro, which will start at $1,299 and be available next month. Both chips will use a second generation of 5-nanometer chip manufacturing technology. Apple did not say who would make the chip, but likely manufacturers include longtime Apple partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW), which is struggling with delays of newer technology.

""They have to do volume"" with the new laptops, said Bob O'Donnell of TECHnalysis Research. ""That's the safe choice,"" he said of the 5-nanometer chips.

But Apple did break with its tradition of not tipping its hand about future technology when it showed off a new car dashboard that it said would be able to display data from major instruments such as speed, fuel levels and gas mileage. Apple said it was in talks with automakers such as Ford Motor Co (F.N), Nissan Motor Co (7201.T), Mercedes-Benz (MBGn.DE) and Honda Motor Corp (7267.T). Vehicles with the software will not be announced until late next year.

The software connects more deeply into core driving systems than prior versions that were limited to the vehicle's infotainment displays for playing music and showing maps. While Apple's car software has been in vehicles since 2014 is currently available in more than 600 models - even including a few motorcycles - it is largely separate from the vehicle's own operating systems. Vehicles owners must leave the system for even basic functions like adjusting a car's climate controls, a shortcoming the updated system is designed to address.

Polestar, the premium electric vehicle maker owned by China's Geely (GEELY.UL) and Volvo Cars, is installing the current version of Apple CarPlay into its Polestar 2 cars through an over-the-air update later this month, Polestar spokesman JP Canton said. Which Polestar cars will get the newer version Apple announced on Monday are under discussion and no further information was available, he said.

A spokeswoman for Ford, which announced a software deal with Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google last year, declined to comment on Apple's announcement. Automakers remain wary of allowing the tech giants unfettered access to the data generated by connected cars, or to allow them to displace the automakers' brands with their own in dashboard displays.

Apple's iPad also received a revamp to make it easier for users to juggle multiple applications and displays and to collaborate on business-centric documents such as presentations. The company also previewed an app called Freeform, which will act as a virtual whiteboard that multiple users can tap to share ideas during video meetings over Apple's FaceTime service. The productivity features put Apple in more direct competition with Microsoft (MSFT.O), whose Surface tablet computers are popular among business users.

Apple also added an edit button to iMessage for sent messages, beating Twitter (TWTR.N) to a long-requested feature.

The tech giant is also adding a tool called ""Safety Check"" to turn off access to sensitive information for people in abusive situations.

Apple introduced a new technology called Passkeys to replace passwords on websites. Apple said Passkeys are safer than traditional passwords because Passkeys are never stored on a web server. The company said it is working to enable the use of Passkeys with non-Apple devices.

Apple shares closed up less than 1%, similar to their level at the start of the presentation.

160,382,Microsoft,2022-06-07,Toxic coalmining buyout shows signs of age,"













MELBOURNE, June 7 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Even the best-planned deals can be overtaken by events. Yankuang Energy’s (600188.SS) bid to buy the 38% of Yancoal Australia (YAL.AX) it doesn’t own is floundering of its own accord. It’s a dud to begin with: The Chinese coalminer wants to pay with a bond convertible into its own stock at a discount to Yancoal’s undisturbed closing price, and it may not be able to get Australian government approval anyway. Yancoal’s three independent board members would not have worked up a sweat rejecting it. Shareholder Glencore (GLEN.L) has already turned up its nose.

The buyer confirmed on Tuesday that it will continue discussions. It’s using Yancoal’s historical average prices to argue it is offering a premium. Trouble is, the target’s stock jumped around 50% in early March two months before the bid. Update the trailing averages to the most recent close instead of Yankuang’s chosen date of May 25, and it would need to raise its offer by at least 8% to abide by its premium calculations. That’s regardless of the undisturbed price: The offer was so noxious Yancoal’s stock has actually fallen since. Time, for now at least, is not on Yankuang’s side. (By Antony Currie)

Summary Companies Target's margin cut hits some retail stocks

Kohl's climbs on sale talks with Franchise Group

Indexes: Dow up 0.8%, S&P 500 up 1%, Nasdaq up 0.9%















NEW YORK, June 7 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied late on Tuesday to end higher for a second straight day as technology and energy shares gained, while Target Corp's warning about excess inventory weighed on retail stocks for much of the session.

Apple Inc (AAPL.O) shares climbed 1.8% despite news earlier in the day that the company must change the connector on iPhones sold in Europe by 2024 after EU countries and lawmakers agreed to a single charging port for mobile phones, tablets and cameras.

The S&P 500 technology index (.SPLRCT) rose 1% and gave the benchmark index its biggest boost. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) shares added 1.4%.

The S&P 500 energy sector index (.SPNY) jumped 3.1% to end at its highest level since 2014, with oil prices sharply higher.

At the same time, shares of Target Corp (TGT.N) fell 2.3% after the retailer said it would have to offer deeper discounts and cut back on stocking discretionary items. read more

Equity trading was choppy, with indexes down early in the day, but the market has been recovering from recent steep losses.

Recently, ""we've had a nice bounce ... and in general investors are feeling better right now. But we are very much in a seesaw market as we've seen all year,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York.

""At some point, we will put in a bottom, and the market will move higher. We have a hard time believing that's any time soon, given a number of fundamental issues overhanging the market,"" he said. ""Certainly what we've seen today from Target isn't good news in terms of the consumer.""

Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields tumbled after the Target news, however, as it fueled some speculation that the worst of inflation may be in the past.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 264.36 points, or 0.8%, to 33,180.14, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 39.25 points, or 0.95%, to 4,160.68 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 113.86 points, or 0.94%, to 12,175.23.

Shares of Walmart (WMT.N) fell 1.2%, and the S&P retail index (.SPXRT) was down 1%.

Consumer price data on Friday is expected to show that inflation remained elevated in May, though core consumer prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy sectors, likely ticked down on an annual basis.

Not all retailers were in the red. Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) shares jumped 9.5% after news the department store chain entered exclusive talks with retail store operator Franchise Group Inc (FRG.O) over a potential sale that would value it at nearly $8 billion. read more

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.36-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.69-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 3 new 52-week highs and 30 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 35 new highs and 121 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.38 billion shares, compared with the 12.50 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

June 8 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Wednesday the company would stop enforcing existing non-compete clauses in the United States, while also committing to a civil rights audit of its workforce policies in 2023.

The Redmond, Washington-based software firm said changes to the enforcement of non-compete clauses would not apply to the company's most senior leadership.

Microsoft added the civil rights audit of its workforce policies and practices would be conducted by a third party and a report would be published.

The software firm also aims to have salary ranges in all of the company's internal and external job postings across the U.S. by at least January 2023. It would also no longer include confidentiality language in its U.S. settlement and separation agreements that prohibits workers from disclosing conduct they perceive as illegal.

The company had last week said it would not resist unionization efforts from its employees in a sign of growing receptiveness in the tech sector that has been for long unconcerned about organized labor. read more

163,324,Microsoft,2022-06-08,UK financial regulators to directly oversee cloud services,"













LONDON, June 8 (Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog will have powers to make onsite visits to oversee cloud computing firms like Amazon (AMZN.O), Google (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) that provide ""critical"" services to financial firms, the finance ministry said on Wednesday.

Banks have moved some services to a handful of outside cloud computing firms to cut costs.

Over 65% of UK firms used the same four cloud providers in 2020, the ministry said, raising concerns of widespread disruption if one of the cloud providers was hacked.

The Bank of England (BoE) said last year that contract terms of providers can be secretive and opaque, and called for standards to ensure they are resilient. read more

The ministry said it proposed to designate which outsourced services are ""critical"" and therefore come under direct supervision of the BoE and Financial Conduct Authority.

The designation would be backed by secondary legislation, allowing regulators to make rules on the provision of services, make onsite inspections, and take enforcement action.

""This will enable the regulators to ensure that services critical third parties provide to firms in the finance sector are resilient, thereby reducing the risk of systemic disruption,"" the finance ministry said in a statement.

Last month, the European Union reached provisional agreement on its set of rules for third party service providers, called the Digital Operational Resilience Act or DORA.

WASHINGTON, June 8 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Fertilizer shortages due to the war in Ukraine are hitting more than just food costs. On Wednesday lawn-care firm Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG.N) issued a sales and profit warning as higher commodity costs continued to squeeze margins. It’s a warning of pain being spread across industries.

A surge in fertilizer prices has shaken the global economy. Even in January before Russia invaded Ukraine, certain costs had more than doubled, according to the International Food Policy Research Institute. Then it went up by nearly 20% when the war began.

Now fertilizer, along with fuel, make up one-third of Scotts cost of goods sold, versus less than 20% three years ago. A late U.S. spring and other headwinds caused Scotts to slash its outlook for adjusted earnings per share. Its shares were down about 10% in Wednesday morning trading. While rising food prices are the biggest economic worry, Scotts shows how widespread fallouts from commodities disruption can be – even for fertilizer. (By Gina Chon)

165,379,Microsoft,2022-06-08,Credit Suisse’s investment-bank drag will persist,"













LONDON, June 8 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Profit warnings are becoming a tradition at Credit Suisse (CSGN.S). The $17 billion Zurich-based group on Wednesday told investors that it expected to report a loss in the second quarter, citing weak results in investment banking businesses like debt trading and underwriting. Credit Suisse’s shares fell by 5%. Unfortunately for under-pressure Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein, the pain is far from over.

The Swiss bank’s historically strong investment banking businesses, such as credit trading and leveraged finance, are suffering from rising interest rates, while Chinese lockdowns have whacked Asian wealth management. That means Gottstein has nothing steady to fall back on while he shrinks other businesses like prime broking. And it’s hard to see what could get better. Rising corporate bond yields will be bad for debt trading and underwriting, and the Asian private banking opportunity may have been overhyped. Plus Credit Suisse’s capital buffers are thinner than they look. Citigroup analysts reckon Wednesday’s profit warning is Gottstein’s fourth in the last five quarters. There may be more to come.

166,388,Microsoft,2022-06-08,EU working on possible ban on providing cloud services to Russia - source,"













BRUSSELS, June 8 (Reuters) - The European Union is working on a possible ban on the provision of cloud services to Russia as part of new sanctions against the Kremlin for the invasion of Ukraine, an EU official told Reuters on Wednesday, noting the measure was technically complex.

If introduced, it is unclear how the EU ban would affect Russia, because top cloud providers in Europe are U.S. companies, including Amazon (AMZN.O), Google (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O).

The European Union last week adopted a new package of sanctions against Russia and Belarus which included an oil embargo, restrictive measures on Russian banks and a ban on the provision of consultancy services to Moscow read more .

An initial version of a press release on the sanctions package issued by the EU Council on June 3 also referred to a ban on the provision of cloud services, but was later amended to delete that reference. That sanction does not appear in the legal texts published in the official journal of the EU.

A press officer for the Council said the initial mention of the sanction on cloud services was ""a material error"", and declined to say whether it may have been caused by a debate on the matter among EU states.

An EU official familiar with decisions on sanctions said the measure on cloud services was never proposed by the European Commission, but added that the EU was working on introducing the ban in possible future rounds of sanctions despite it being technically difficult.

In a tweet on Tuesday, the Ukrainian president's adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said that the editing of the press release by the EU Council had been done without offering a clear explanation and that it suggested a possible watering down of sanctions.

""We must increase the sanctions pressure, not decrease,"" he said.

Bloomberg News, which first reported the news, said more than 400 employees will be affected.

June 9 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) will bring several Xbox games to Samsung's 2022 smart TVs from June 30 in a major step towards attracting gamers without the console.

Subscribers to Xbox's cloud-gaming service can play more than a 100 titles on the TVs, which will be able to pair with popular bluetooth-enabled controllers, Microsoft said on Thursday.

Titles including ""Halo Infinite"" and ""Forza Horizon 5"" will be available on the new range of TVs and the Xbox console will not be needed to play the games.

Xbox started working with major TV manufacturers in 2021 in an effort to take its games across devices and boost its subscription-based offering called Xbox Game Pass.

It launched the streaming of games on Android smartphones in 2018.

169,629,Microsoft,2022-06-10,Wall Street suffers biggest weekly loss since January after hot CPI data,"Summary

Summary Companies Consumer price index rose to 1% in May from 0.3% in April

Netflix falls after Goldman Sachs downgrades to 'sell'

Indexes: Dow down 2.7%, S&P 500 down 2.9%, Nasdaq down 3.5%















NEW YORK, June 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks posted their biggest weekly percentage declines since January and ended sharply lower on the day Friday as a steeper-than-expected rise in U.S. consumer prices in May fueled fears of more aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.

Tech and growth stocks, whose valuations rely more heavily on future cash flows, led the decline. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) drove losses in the S&P 500.

Following the inflation report, two-year Treasury yields , which are highly sensitive to rate hikes, spiked to 3.057%, the highest since June 2008. Benchmark 10-year yields reached 3.178%, the highest since May 9.

The U.S. Labor Department's report showed the consumer price index (CPI) increased 1.0% last month after gaining 0.3% in April. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the monthly CPI picking up 0.7%.

Year-on-year, CPI surged 8.6%, its biggest gain since 1981 and following an 8.3% jump in May. read more

Stocks have been volatile this year, and recent selling has largely been tied to worries over inflation, rising interest rates and the likelihood of a recession.

""Today's report should extinguish any pretense that a 'pause' in rate hikes will likely be appropriate by the end of summer, as the Fed is clearly still behind the eight ball on bringing inflation under control,"" said Jason Pride, chief investment officer for private wealth at Glenmede in Philadelphia.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 880 points, or 2.73%, to 31,392.79; the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 116.96 points, or 2.91%, to 3,900.86; and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 414.20 points, or 3.52%, to 11,340.02.

[1/3] A trader works on the trading floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., May 20, 2022. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly 1 2 3

The major indexes registered their biggest weekly percentage drops since the week ended Jan. 21, with the Dow down 4.58%, the S&P 500 down 5.06% and the Nasdaq down 5.60% for the week.

The S&P 500 is now down 18.2% for the year so far.

On Friday, the S&P 500 growth index (.IGX) took a 3.7% hit, while the value index (.IVX) fell 2.2%.

The inflation report was published ahead of an anticipated second 50 basis points rate hike from the Fed on Wednesday. A further half-percentage-point is priced in for July, with a strong chance of a similar move in September.

One worry is that an aggressive push higher on rates by the Fed could send the economy into recession. read more

Among the day's losers, Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) slid 5.1% after Goldman downgraded the streaming video giant's stock to ""sell"" from ""neutral"" due to a possibly weaker macro environment.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 5.70-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 4.05-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and 44 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 17 new highs and 326 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.62 billion shares, compared with the 11.88 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

170,447,Microsoft,2022-06-10,"Activision Blizzard recognizes new ""Call of Duty"" workers union","













NEW YORK, June 10 (Reuters) - Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) on Friday recognized the Communications Workers of America and began negotiations on behalf of a small group of quality assurance testers at the ""Call of Duty"" videogame maker who voted to unionize last month.

Workers across technology companies are becoming more vocal about better pay and working conditions. More than 200 workers at Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) formed a labor union for U.S. and Canadian offices last year.

""While first labor contracts can take some time to complete, we will meet CWA leaders at the bargaining table and work toward an agreement that supports the success of all our employees,"" Chief Executive Bobby Kotick said in a letter to all U.S. Activision employees.

Quality assurance employees at Raven Software in Middleton, Wisconsin, voted 19-3 in favor of joining the CWA, according to a tally by U.S. National Labor Relation Board (NLRB) officials. read more

Wisconsin is a right-to-work state, meaning any worker can choose not to be a union member.

CWA said Activision employees' vote will not have to be re-certified if Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) succeeds in acquiring the company,in a $69 billion deal announced in January. read more

The videogame maker initially urged the NLRB to dismiss the petition for a union election, citing a recent reorganization, and argued that any vote on unionization should be conducted among a much larger group of employees. read more

Jennifer Hadsall, a regional NLRB director in Minneapolis, ruled that the proposed unit should stand, finding that the testers the CWA sought to represent had a ""meaningfully distinct collective-bargaining interest.""

The CWA has increasingly focused in recent years on organizing non-union workers in the tech and video game industries.

171,743,Microsoft,2022-06-13,S&P 500 confirms bear market as recession worry grows,"Summary

Summary Companies Expectations for 75 basis point hike in June climb

Wall Street 'fear gauge' surges to one-month high

S&P 500 hits lowest level since March 2021















NEW YORK, June 13 (Reuters) - U.S. equities tumbled on Monday, with the S&P 500 confirming it is in a bear market, as fears grow that the expected aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve would push the economy into a recession.

The benchmark S&P index has fallen for four straight days, with the index now down more than 20% from its most recent record closing high to confirm a bear market began on Jan. 3, according to a commonly used definition.

All the major S&P sectors were sharply lower, with only about 10 components of the S&P 500 in positive territory on the day. Markets have been under pressure this year as climbing prices, including a jump in oil prices due in part to the war in Ukraine, have put the Fed on track to take strong actions to tighten its monetary policy, such as interest rate hike.

The Fed is scheduled to make its next policy announcement on Wednesday and investors will be highly focused on any clues for how aggressive the central bank intends to be in raising rates. read more

High-growth market heavyweights such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) were the biggest drags on the S&P 500, as the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note hit 3.44%, its highest level since April 2011. Growth stocks are more likely to see their earnings suffer in a rising rate environment.

A hotter-than-expected consumer price index (CPI) reading on Friday prompted traders to price in a total of 175 basis point (bps) in interest rate hikes by September.

Goldman Sachs late on Monday said it expects 75-basis-point increases in June and July. Expectations for a 75 basis point hike at the June meeting jumped to 96% late on Monday from 30% earlier in the day, according to CME's Fedwatch Tool.

""The market had been trying to rally around the idea that inflation has peaked, and the Fed would not have to be more aggressive,"" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky.

""That story fell apart on Friday with the CPI report, showing broad inflation being entrenched everywhere you look.""

According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 149.91 points, or 3.85%, to end at 3,750.95 points, while the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) lost 526.82 points, or 4.65%, to 10,813.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 857.70 points, or 2.73%, to 30,535.09.

S&P 500 bear markets

In addition, the two-year 10-year U.S. Treasury yield curve briefly inverted for the first time since April, which many in the markets see as a reliable signal that a recession could come in the next year or two. read more

The Nasdaq Composite index (.IXIC), which suffered its fourth straight drop, confirmed it was in bear market territory on March 7 and has declined roughly 30% this year.

The CBOE Volatility index (.VIX), also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, spiked to its highest level since May. Still, many analysts view the level as subdued and could mean more selling pressure is in store.

""This is a market that does not look like it is capitulating as much as it is frustrated,"" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle.

""Even with some of the securities being thrown out, it is just not deep enough, violent enough to see that people have taken positions off.

for 2022

Cryptocurrency- and blockchain-related stocks, including Riot Blockchain (RIOT.O), Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA.O) and Coinbase Global (COIN.O), all plunged as bitcoin slumped more than 10% after major U.S. cryptocurrency lending company Celsius Network froze withdrawals and transfers citing ""extreme"" conditions.

June 13 (Reuters) - Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) topped Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit and revenue on Monday, as demand for its cloud products soars amid an industry-wide shift to cloud-based platforms.

Shares in the Austin, Texas-based company, whose fourth-quarter revenue jumped 5%, rose about 12% in extended trade.

""We believe that this revenue growth spike indicates that our infrastructure business has now entered a hyper-growth phase,"" Oracle Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz said in a statement.

Oracle, which reported a currency headwind of 5% in the fourth quarter, up from 2% to 3% in the third quarter, said it expects substantial revenue growth in its cloud business, despite rising inflation and a stronger greenback.

Microsoft (MSFT.O) in April and Salesforce Inc (CRM.N) last month also indicated a strong future for the cloud market as companies increase spending, though the former cut its fourth-quarter forecast for profit and revenue earlier this month due to unfavorable exchange rates. read more

Oracle warned of a $100 million hit per quarter in fiscal year 2023 as a result of suspending services in Russia.

The company, however, expects first-quarter revenue growth between 17% and 18%, boosted by its $28-billion acquisition of healthcare IT company Cerner Corp.

Oracle's forecast comes on a day U.S. equity markets tumbled with the S&P 500 (.SPX) confirming it was in a bear market as investors fear aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve could plunge the economy into recession. read more

The company expects first-quarter adjusted EPS between $1.04 and $1.08 compared with analysts' average estimate of $1.13.

Revenue for the fourth quarter ended May 31 grew to $11.84 billion, above analysts' average estimate of $11.66 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Excluding items, the company earned $1.54 per share, beating estimates of $1.37 per share.

173,414,Microsoft,2022-06-15,More than 100 CEOs urge U.S. Congress to pass China competition bill,"













SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON, June 15 (Reuters) - Chief executives from Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Wednesday called on Congress to pass legislation aimed at boosting U.S. economic competitiveness against China, including in chip manufacturing.

Those executives and more than 100 others signed a letter urging the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, which each have passed different versions of the legislation, to reach an agreement and send a bill to President Joe Biden for his signature. Legislators will break for a summer recess in August, after which most observers expect lawmakers to shift their attention to this fall's midterm elections.

""Our global competitors are investing in their industry, their workers, and their economies, and it is imperative that Congress act to enhance U.S. competitiveness,"" saidthe letter.

The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), which organized the letter signing, said the letter was the largest group of corporate leaders so far to endorse the bill.

The legislation includes $52 billion in federal funding to expand U.S. semiconductor manufacturing capacity, which happens in factories called ""fabs,"" short for fabrication plants.

“The leaders of our industry are under pressure to get fabs up to respond to the growing demand for chips. And they can't wait,” said SIA CEO John Neuffer, adding that the bill would “ensure that more of those fabs are going to be built in the U.S. rather than overseas.”

The SIA is also calling for an investment tax credit for semiconductor manufacturing and design in the competitiveness legislation.

Democratic House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said he hoped lawmakers could complete the legislation by the end of the month. He added that Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told him “he is not going to do anything to oppose or undermine consideration of this bill.”

JERUSALEM, June 15 (Reuters) - U.S. defence contractor L3Harris (LHX.N) is in talks to buy Israeli spyware firm NSO Group, U.S. and Israeli media reported, citing sources with knowledge of the deal.

The deal is yet to be finalised and needs to be approved by Israel, the U.S. and L3Harris’ board of directors, according to the joint report by Haaretz, The Washington Post and The Guardian, and confirms parts of a report published in Intelligence Online this week.

It noted that The White House is concerned that any deal with to buy the Israeli firm’s hacking tools would raise serious counterintelligence and security concerns.

NSO declined to comment on the reports.

The surveillance firm, which makes the Pegasus software, has been in the spotlight after revelations its tools had been used by governments and other agencies to spy on people’s cellphones. NSO has said its technology helps catch criminals.

NSO lost many of its existing customers when the U.S. Commerce Department in November banned the company.

The reports said that if approved, the deal could see NSO removed from the banned list – either directly, or by having its assets bought by L3Harris, which will only work with the United States and its allies.

In January, NSO had told Reuters it was in talks with a number of U.S. funds over ""various financial moves"", confirming media reports that it was discussing a sale of its assets.

Apple (AAPL.O) is among those to have sued NSO, saying it violated U.S. laws by breaking into the software installed on iPhones.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc , Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) have also criticised NSO or taken legal action.

175,295,Microsoft,2022-06-15,Roblox May bookings take hit from strong dollar,"













June 15 (Reuters) - Roblox Corp (RBLX.N) on Wednesday became the latest U.S. company to report a hit from a stronger dollar, saying its bookings fell up to 11% last month despite a jump in daily active users.

The announcement sent the gaming platform's shares down 4% in premarket trading and echoed remarks from other major American corporations such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Coca-Cola Co (KO.N). read more

""We estimate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations led to a reduction of around 4% in May 2022 bookings,"" said Roblox, one of the world's most popular gaming sites for children.

A hawkish Federal Reserve and heightened geopolitical tensions have driven a 10% gain in the dollar so far this year. A stronger greenback typically eats into the profits of companies that convert foreign currencies into dollars.

The dollar strength adds to the woes of Roblox, which said in May that net losses would continue for the ""foreseeable future"" after a slowdown in the pandemic-era gaming boom dented its first-quarter bookings.

In May, estimated bookings were between 9% and 11% lower from a year earlier, it said.

Bookings refer to Roblox's virtual currency ""Robux"" that players can spend in-game to upgrade their avatars by purchasing items such as clothing, collectibles or accessories.

176,468,Microsoft,2022-06-16,Analysis: Investors worry that U.S. profit forecasts are too high,"













NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - Concerns are growing that U.S. corporate earnings are increasingly at risk from dizzying inflation, a strong dollar and rising interest rates, complicating the outlook for investors already reeling from the S&P 500's bear market confirmation earlier this week.

While second-quarter profit growth forecasts have fallen in recent weeks, estimates for the third and fourth quarters and for all of 2022 have held up or risen, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. As of Friday, Wall Street analysts expected S&P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, up from 8.8% at the start of April and from 8.4% on Jan. 1.

Strategists worry those estimates are unlikely to hold up. Many expect more negative outlooks from U.S. companies in the coming weeks and said that guidance will then be reflected in consensus profit growth estimates.

Most S&P 500 companies will report second-quarter earnings after mid-July, and software giant Microsoft (MSFT.O) and retailer Target (TGT.N) have been among the companies issuing dour outlooks in recent weeks.

""Estimates are too high, and you'll see them start to come down as the second-quarter numbers come out and as companies talk about what they're seeing,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel.

Falling profit expectations could spell more trouble for a market that has been pummeled by worries over how an aggressive Federal Reserve response to surging inflation could hit growth.

The S&P 500 (.SPX) finished Monday more than 20% below its record closing high, confirming the index is in a bear market, according to a commonly used definition. The drop followed stronger-than-expected inflation data last week that ratcheted up expectations for how much the Fed will need to tighten monetary policy in order to tame consumer prices. read more

The Fed on Wednesday raised rates by 75 basis points, its biggest increase since 1994 and has now increased borrowing costs by a total of 150 basis points this year. read more

Worries that corporate profits are wavering could bolster the argument that stocks remain richly valued, even after their sharp decline this year. The S&P 500's forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio stood at 17.1 as of Friday versus 22.1 at the end of December but was still above its long-term average of about 16, Refinitiv data showed.

Challenges facing U.S. companies include a stronger dollar, which was cited by Microsoft when the software-maker cut its fourth-quarter forecast for profit and revenue earlier this month. A stronger greenback typically eats into the profits of companies that have international operations and convert foreign currencies into dollars. read more

The U.S. currency is up about 9% so far this year and near a two-decade high against a basket of its peers, driven by expectations of higher U.S. rates and heightened geopolitical tensions.

After Microsoft's announcement, investors will be listening for what other software and tech companies like Adobe Inc (ADBE.O) and IBM(IBM.N) have to say about currency issues in upcoming reports, said Daniel Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus Trust. Adobe is due to release second-quarter results after the bell Thursday.

Also closely watched will be retailers and other consumer discretionary companies, which have struggled under the effects of surging inflation. Shares of Walmart (WMT.N) and other big retailers took a hit last week after Target cut its quarterly profit margin forecast and said it would have to offer deeper discounts to clear inventory. read more

Other challenges include sky-high oil prices and rising interest rates, which have weighed on tech and growth stocks, whose valuations heavily rely on future cash flows. Recent COVID-related lockdowns in China could also take a toll. read more

""We expect the energy crunch to hit growth and higher labor costs to eat into profits. The problem: Consensus earnings estimates don’t appear to reflect this,"" analysts at Blackrock wrote in a recent note on why they are not ""buying the dip"" in stocks.

To be sure, while consumer spending is ""shifting,"" it does not seem to be slowing, said Steve DeSanctis, small- and mid-capitalization equity strategist at Jefferies. That may suggest some retailers could benefit from changing consumer habits, even as others feel the pinch.

At the same time, investors may already be pricing in expected hits to earnings given stocks' recent tumble, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco.

177,413,Microsoft,2022-06-16,"Meta, Google, Twitter vow to fight fake news better as EU gets tougher","













BRUSSELS, June 16 (Reuters) - Meta , Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Twitter (TWTR.N) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) agreed on Thursday to take a tougher line against disinformation under an updated EU code of practice that could hit them with hefty fines if they fail to do so.

More than 30 signatories including advertising bodies have committed to the updated Code of Practice on disinformation, the European Commission said.

The signatories agree to do more to tackle deep fakes, fake accounts and political advertising, while non-compliance can lead to fines as much as 6% of a company's global turnover, the EU executive said, confirming a Reuters report last week. read more

The companies, which include TikTok and Amazon's (AMZN.O) live streaming e-sports platform Twitch, have six months to comply with their pledges and will have to present a progress report at the beginning of 2023.

""The new code is a testimony that Europe has learned its lessons and that we are not naive any longer,"" Commission Vice-President Vera Jourova told a news conference.

She said Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic and Britain's withdrawal from the European Union accelerated the EU's crackdown on fake news.

Sanctions may including banning companies from Europe, EU industry chief Thierry Breton said.

""If there is consistent flouting of the rules, we can also think about stopping their access to our space of information,"" he told the news conference.

Critics such as the Association of Commercial Television and Video on Demand Services in Europe (ACT) said there were grave shortcomings in the revised Code.

""The Review does not offer concrete commitments to limit 'impermissible manipulative behavior'. Commitments go no further than a blanket statement to follow the law which is obvious and does not require a Code,"" it said.

June 17 (Reuters) - More workers in Britain are opting for a three-day office week as they warm to a hybrid model, data from workspace provider IWG (IWG.L) showed on Friday.

The pandemic has upended the way people work, prompting several firms to encourage employees to split time between their homes and offices, while cutting down on the cost of renting largely unused spaces.

Employees favoured coming to the office on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, with the midweek accounting for 23% more visits than on Mondays and Fridays, according to the latest UK footfall, data from the owner of Regus and Spaces brands showed.

The data from IWG's 300 workspaces in Britain covering hundreds of thousand of workers also showed 15% more employees visited their offices in May than in April.

""The data shows there is strong appetite to spend part of the time in an office environment, particularly local flex spaces, and that the era of long daily commutes is well and truly over,"" IWG CEO Mark Dixon said in a statement.

The workspace provider, which counts Microsoft (MSFT.O), Uber (UBER.N), BT (BT.L) and Deliveroo (ROO.L) among others as its customers in Britain, however, did not specify the impact of the higher footfall on occupancy levels or its income streams.

Tuesday has been the most popular day to be in the office so far this year in the UK, closely followed by Wednesday and Thursday.

""The trend is reinforced by the hospitality industry, whose leaders have said Wednesday and Thursday evenings have become the new Thursdays and Fridays for drinking and dining out,"" IWG said.

179,288,Microsoft,2022-06-16,Activision board says no evidence senior execs ignored harassment cases,"













June 16 (Reuters) - Activision Blizzard Inc's (ATVI.O) board and external advisers said on Thursday there was no evidence to suggest that senior executives intentionally ignored or attempted to downplay reported instances of gender harassment.

There were some substantiated instances of gender harassment, the independent directors of the company's board said in a filing.

But these instances did not support the conclusion that senior leadership or the board were aware of and tolerated gender harassment, the directors said.

Activision, which is being acquired by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) for $68.7 billion, has been under fire for alleged misconduct at the company.

California in July last year brought a lawsuit against the company, alleging it ""fostered a sexist culture"".

Activision has also been the subject of investigative stories detailing allegations of sexual harassment internally, with employees staging walkouts to protest the company's response to the issues. read more

Workers in November last year circulated a petition calling for the removal of Chief Executive Officer Bobby Kotick amid mounting criticism of the culture at the company.

In response, Activision's board formed a Workplace Responsibility Committee to oversee its progress in improving culture.

Activision Blizzard is also seeing unionization efforts from its employees with a small group of quality assurance testers voting for joining the Communications Workers of America last month. read more

180,166,Microsoft,2022-06-17,Internet Explorer gravestone goes viral in South Korea,"













SEOUL, June 17 (Reuters) - For Jung Ki-young, a South Korean software engineer, Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) decision to retire its Internet Explorer web browser marked the end of a quarter-century love-hate relationship with the technology.

To commemorate its demise, he spent a month and 430,000 won ($330) designing and ordering a headstone with Explorer's ""e"" logo and the English epitaph: ""He was a good tool to download other browsers.""

After the memorial went on show at a cafe run by his brother in the southern city of Gyeongju, a photo of the tombstone went viral.

Microsoft scaled down support for the once omnipresent Internet Explorer on Wednesday after a 27-year run, to focus on its faster browser, Microsoft Edge.

Jung said the memorial showed his mixed feelings for the older software, which had played such a big part in his working life.

""It was a pain in the ass, but I would call it a love-hate relationship because Explorer itself once dominated an era,"" he told Reuters.

He said he found it took him longer to make sure his websites and online apps worked with Explorer, than with other browsers.

But his customers kept asking him to make sure their websites looked good in Explorer, which remained the default browser in South Korean government offices and many banks for years.

Launched in 1995, Explorer became the world's leading browser for more than a decade as it was bundled with Microsoft's Windows operating system that came pre-installed in billions of computers. read more

But it started losing out to Google's Chrome in the late 2000s and became a subject of countless internet memes, with some developers suggesting it was sluggish compared with its rivals.

Jung said he had meant to give people a laugh with the gravestone, but was still surprised about how far the joke went online.

""That's another reason for me to thank the Explorer, it has now allowed me to make a world-class joke,"" he said.

""I regret that it's gone, but won't miss it. So its retirement, to me, is a good death.""

181,333,Microsoft,2022-06-17,Regulator calls for Big Tech privacy cases to be handled by EU watchdog,"













BRUSSELS, June 17 (Reuters) - Cross-border Big Tech privacy cases should be handled by the EU watchdog rather than national agencies, the head of the bloc's data protection watchdog said on Friday as he lamented the poor enforcement of landmark rules adopted four years ago.

The rules known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have drawn criticism over the costs of compliance and long-running investigations with few decisions.

The Irish regulator, which has oversight of Google (GOOGL.O), Meta , Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N), has in particular come under fire for its slow pace of enforcement.

One solution could be to hand over big cases to the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) whose members are national privacy regulators and the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) which oversees EU institutions, EDPS head Wojciech Wiewiorowski said.

""I myself share views of those who believe we still do not see sufficient enforcement, in particular against Big Tech,"" he told a conference.

""At a certain moment, a pan-European data protection enforcement model is going to be a necessary step to ensure real and consistent high-level protection of fundamental rights to data protection and privacy across the European Union,"" Wiewiorowski said.

He said this could mean that key investigations, based on a certain threshold, would be done at a central level, in essence the EDPB, and subject to direct scrutiny of Europe's top court.

Empowering the EDPB to take on Big Tech cases directly would mean changing GDPR rules, a move which the European Commission is unlikely to do under the current leadership because of insufficient time, a European Commission official told Reuters.

REUTERS/Stringer















NEW DELHI, June 17 (Reuters) - Authorities imposed restrictions on Friday on gatherings in a satellite city of India's capital that is home to offices of several multinational firms, and one person was killed as protests against a new military recruitment process spread.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government unveiled the new recruitment system this week, called Agnipath or ""path of fire"" in Hindi, triggering turmoil with police firing into the air to break up stone-throwing crowds and the torching of railway infrastructure.

The system aims to bring in more people to the military on short, four-year contracts to lower the average age of India's 1.38 million-strong armed forces and cut down on burgeoning pension costs. read more

But many potential recruits object, concerned about employment opportunities after serving their four-year terms and disappointed to miss out on a pension, and thousands of young men took to the streets on Friday, with protests turning violent in at least three states.

One protester was killed in a clash with police in the southern city of Secunderabad, a government official said.

The administration of Gurugram district, south of New Delhi, said no more than four people could gather at one place in an effort to forestall demonstrations.

""This order shall come into force with immediate effect,"" Gurugram's administration said in a notice, a copy of which was posted on social media by district's information department.

While there have been no reports of protests in Gurugram, some demonstrators were out in the neighbouring district of Palwal on Thursday.

Some of the world's major companies have offices in Gurugram including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Meta and Google Inc. (GOOGL.O). it is also home to manufacturing facilities of major Indian companies like Maruti Suzuki (MRTI.NS).

The new recruitment system has drawn criticism from opposition parties, and even from some members of Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, who say it will lead to more unemployment in a country grappling with joblessness. read more

The government has said the armed forces aim to recruit about 46,000 people under the new system this year, and will keep only 25% of them on at the end of their four-year terms.

'NO PENSION'

In the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, protests erupted in 14 districts, and police fired into the air to push back stone-throwing crowds, senior police official Prashant Kumar said.

""The police are trying to disperse protesters by holding talks with them,"" Kumar told Reuters.

Avnish Kumar, a 19-year-old from Uttar Pradesh's Ballia district who hoped to join the army, said he was disappointed with the new scheme.

""The tenure of the job is only four years and only 25% people will get job after that,"" he told Reuters by telephone. ""There is no pension.""

In neighbouring Bihar state, protesters torched train coaches in at least two stations and disrupted rail services, police said.

Hundreds of people gathered in Secunderabad in the south, clashing with police and setting fire to railway station property, police said.

The new process will bring in men and women between the ages of 17-and-a-half and 21 for a four-year tenure at non-officer ranks, with only a quarter retained for longer.

Soldiers have previously been recruited by the army, navy and air force separately, and typically serve for up to 17 years, for the lowest ranks.

The government on Friday also announced a one-time extension for the maximum entry age into the scheme to 23 since recruitment had been frozen for the past two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Indexes up: Dow 2.15%, S&P 2.45%, Nasdaq 2.51%















June 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes jumped over 2% on Tuesday as investors scooped up shares of megacap growth and energy companies after the stock market swooned last week on worries over a global economic downturn.

All 11 major S&P 500 (.SPX) sectors gained, as stocks rebounded broadly after the benchmark index last week logged its biggest weekly percentage decline since March 2020.

Investors are trying to assess how far stocks can fall as they weigh risks to the economy with the Federal Reserve taking aggressive measures to try to tamp down surging inflation. The S&P 500 earlier this month fell over 20% from its January all-time high, confirming the common definition of a bear market.

""Do I think we have hit bottom? No. I think we are going to see more volatility, I think the bottoming process will likely take some time,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. ""But I do think it is a good sign to see investor interest.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 641.47 points, or 2.15%, to 30,530.25, and the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 89.95 points, or 2.45%, at 3,764.79. The Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 270.95 points, or 2.51%, at 11,069.30.

The energy sector (.SPNY), the top-gaining S&P 500 sector this year, surged 5.1% after tumbling last week. Every sector gained at least 1%.

Megacap stocks Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) all rose solidly to give the biggest individual boosts to the S&P 500. Apple rose 3.3%, Tesla jumped 9.4% and Microsoft added 2.5%.

The Fed last week approved its largest interest rate increase in more than a quarter of a century to stem a surge in inflation.

Investors are pivoting to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony to the U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday for clues on future interest rate hikes and his latest views on the economy.

Investors are ""trying to read the tea leaves to see how aggressive the Fed is going to get,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. ""That's a hard question to answer right now because they are going to see what happens to the inflation story.""

June 21 (Reuters) - Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) shareholders voted in favor of a proposal on Tuesday for a report on the video game company's efforts to prevent employee abuse, harassment and discrimination.

June 21 (Reuters) - Meta (META.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and other tech giants racing to build the emerging metaverse concept have formed a group to foster development of industry standards that would make the companies' nascent digital worlds compatible with each other.

Participants in the Metaverse Standards Forum include many of the biggest companies working in the space, from chip makers to gaming companies, as well as established standards-setting bodies like the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the group said in an statement announcing its creation on Tuesday.

Conspicuously missing from the member list for now however is Apple (AAPL.O), which analysts expect to become a dominant player in the metaverse race once it introduces a mixed reality headset this year or next. read more

Gaming companies Roblox and Niantic also were not included among the forum's participants, nor were emerging crypto-based metaverse platforms like The Sandbox or Decentraland.

Apple has not yet publicly acknowledged plans for a headset, although it has reportedly given its board a sneak peek of the product, according to Bloomberg. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the new metaverse forum.

The logo of Meta Platforms is seen in Davos, Switzerland, May 22, 2022. Picture taken May 22, 2022. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo

Introducing such a device would put Apple in direct competition with Meta, which has staked its future on the growth of the metaverse and invested heavily in hardware to make its vision of interconnected virtual worlds a reality.

Meta, known as Facebook until it changed its name as part of its metaverse pivot last year, has disclosed plans for a mixed-reality headset code-named ""Cambria"" to be released this year.

Apple has been heavily involved in creating web standards such as HTML5 in the past. For three-dimensional content in the metaverse, Apple worked with Pixar on the ""USDZ"" file format and with Adobe to ensure it supported the format.

Neil Trevett, an executive at chip maker Nvidia who is chairing the Metaverse Standards Forum, said in a statement to Reuters that any company is welcome to join the group, including participants from the crypto world.

The forum aims to facilitate communication between a variety of standards organizations and companies to bring about ""real-world interoperability"" in the metaverse, he said, without addressing how Apple's absence would affect that goal.

OAKLAND, Calif., June 21 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Tuesday said it would stop selling technology that guesses someone's emotion based on a facial image and would no longer provide unfettered access to facial recognition technology.

The actions reflect efforts by leading cloud providers to rein in sensitive technologies on their own as lawmakers in the United States and Europe continue to weigh comprehensive legal limits.

Since at least last year, Microsoft has been reviewing whether emotion recognition systems are rooted in science.

""These efforts raised important questions about privacy, the lack of consensus on a definition of 'emotions,' and the inability to generalize the linkage between facial expression and emotional state across use cases, regions, and demographics,"" Sarah Bird, principal group product manager at Microsoft's Azure AI unit, said in a blog post.

Existing customers will have one year before losing access to artificial intelligence tools that purport to infer emotion, gender, age, smile, facial hair, hair and makeup.

Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google Cloud last year embarked on a similar evaluation, first reported by Reuters. read more Google blocked 13 planned emotions from its tool for reading emotion and placed under review four existing ones, such as joy and sorrow. It was weighing a new system that would describe movements such as frowning and smiling, without seeking to attach them to an emotion.

Google did not immediately respond to request for comment on Tuesday.

Microsoft also said customers now must obtain approval to use its facial recognition services, which can enable people to log into websites or open locked doors through a face scan.

The company called on clients to avoid situations that infringe on privacy or in which the technology might struggle, such as identifying minors, but did not explicitly ban those uses.

187,489,Microsoft,2022-06-22,Amazon has a plan to make Alexa mimic anyone's voice,"













LAS VEGAS, June 22 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) wants to give customers the chance to make Alexa, the company's voice assistant, sound just like their grandmother -- or anyone else.

The online retailer is developing a system to let Alexa mimic any voice after hearing less than a minute of audio, said Rohit Prasad, an Amazon senior vice president, at a conference the company held in Las Vegas Wednesday. The goal is to ""make the memories last"" after ""so many of us have lost someone we love"" during the pandemic, Prasad said.

Amazon declined to share when it would roll out such a feature.

The work wades into an area of technology that has garnered close scrutiny for potential benefits and abuses. For instance, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) recently restricted which businesses could use its software to parrot voices. The goal is to help people with speech impairments or other problems but some worry it could also be used to propagate political deepfakes. read more

Amazon hopes the project will help Alexa become ubiquitous in shoppers' lives. But public attention has already shifted elsewhere. At Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, an engineer made the highly contested claim that a company chat bot had advanced to sentience. Another Amazon executive said Tuesday that Alexa had 100 million customers globally, in line with figures the company has provided for device sales since January 2019.

Prasad said Amazon's aim for Alexa is ""generalizable intelligence,"" or the ability to adapt to user environments and learn new concepts with little external input. He said that goal is ""not to be confused with the all-knowing, all-capable, uber artificial general intelligence,"" or AGI, which Alphabet's DeepMind unit and Elon Musk-co-founded OpenAI are seeking.

Amazon shared its vision for companionship with Alexa at the conference. In a video segment, it portrayed a child who asked, ""Alexa, can grandma finish reading me the Wizard of Oz?""

A moment later, Alexa affirmed the command and changed her voice. She spoke soothingly, less robotically, ostensibly sounding like the individual's grandmother in real life.

188,19,Microsoft,2022-06-22,"Russian cyber spies attack Ukraine's allies, Microsoft says","













SAN FRANCISCO, June 22 (Reuters) - Russian government hackers have conducted multiple cyber spy operations on countries allied with Ukraine since Moscow's February invasion of that country, Microsoft said in a report on Wednesday.

""The cyber aspects of the current war extend far beyond Ukraine and reflect the unique nature of cyberspace,"" Microsoft President Brad Smith said in the report.

The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Moscow has in the past denied conducting foreign cyber espionage missions, saying it ""contradicts the principles of Russian foreign policy.""

Researchers had already traced a series of destructive cyberattacks on Ukrainian entities to Russian state-backed hacking groups since the conflict began.

The Microsoft report said researchers found 128 organizations in 42 countries outside Ukraine were also targeted by the same groups in stealthy, espionage-focused hacks.

Outside Ukraine, the United States was the country most-targeted by such intrusion efforts, the report said, but member countries of the military alliance NATO — which has provided critical support to Ukraine amid the conflict – were hit too.

These include organizations based in Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Poland, as well as Finland and Sweden, countries that have voiced a desire to join the NATO alliance.

""The target appeared to be mostly governments, although also included think tanks, humanitarian groups, and critical infrastructure providers,"" the report said.

Microsoft said the hacking against allies was successful about 29% of the time and in some cases led to data being stolen.

Foreign policy experts say they fear Russia’s combined kinetic and cyber warfare strategy against Ukraine will become a model for future conflicts.

In an earlier report, Microsoft indicated cyberattacks - which involved data wiping malware - laid the groundwork for military missions in Ukraine.

The latest research cited six incidents since the invasion when cyberattacks against targets in Ukraine appeared to precede military attacks. In one, it said Russian hackers tried to breach a Ukrainian nuclear power company’s computer network a day before Russia’s army occupied the company's largest plant.

Russia calls the invasion a ""special operation"" to root out ""Nazis."" Kyiv and the West call that a baseless justification for a war to wipe out Ukraine's identity as a separate nation.

New Russian law may encourage more foreign firms to go

'Trickle is becoming a torrent,' says analyst















June 23 (Reuters) - U.S. companies Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) and Nike (NKE.N) plan to fully exit Russia, the two firms told Reuters on Thursday, as the pace of Western firms departing accelerated.

Telecoms equipment maker Cisco will wind down its business in Russia and Belarus, the company said. Nike (NKE.N) is making a full exit from Russia three months after suspending its operations there, the sportswear maker said. read more

Foreign companies seeking to exit Russia over the war in Ukraine face the prospect of a new law being passed in the coming weeks allowing Moscow to seize assets and impose criminal penalties. That has encouraged some businesses to accelerate their departure.

""What was a trickle is becoming a torrent"", said Paul Musgrave, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts, commenting on the latest round of companies announcing they would leave.

Cisco suspended business operations, including sales and services, in Russia in March.

""We have now made the decision to begin an orderly wind-down of our business in Russia and Belarus,"" it said in an emailed statement on Thursday.

Earlier this month, Cisco's rival International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) began winding down its business in Russia and Microsoft said it was making substantial cuts to its Russian business. read more

The withdrawal of top technology firms such as Cisco, IBM and Microsoft limits access to critical equipment for Russian businesses and households. They may now have to depend on older equipment and domestic alternatives.

Cisco has offered relocation options to its few hundred employees in those countries, it said. The company did not disclose which countries the employees were offered as alternative locations.

RIVALS MAY BENEFIT

Companies heading for the exit may struggle to return, said Musgrave. ""This presents opportunities for domestic firms in some markets but even more for brands from China and elsewhere to make inroads,"" he said.

Nike said on March 3 it would temporarily suspend operations at all its Nike-owned and operated stores in Russia. It has now decided to leave entirely, it said Thursday.

Cisco and Nike join the likes of McDonald's and Renault in making complete exits from Russia. More companies are expected to leave in the coming weeks ahead of the new law.

The law, which could be in place within weeks, allows Russia to appoint administrators over companies owned by foreigners in ""unfriendly"" countries, who want to quit Russia as the conflict with Ukraine drags down its economy.

Nike's rival Adidas said in March it was shutting its Russian stores and pausing online sales.

Adidas currently has no plans to resume business in Russia, the German sportswear company told Reuters on Thursday.

""The operation of Adidas' stores and Adidas' online retail in Russia continues to be suspended until further notice, this also applies to the delivery of goods to Russia,"" it said in an emailed statement.

190,399,Microsoft,2022-06-23,Accenture tempers 2022 profit view due to stronger dollar,"













June 23 (Reuters) - IT services company Accenture Plc forecast fourth-quarter revenue below expectations and tempered its fiscal 2022 profit forecast on Thursday, threatened by rising inflation and the impact of a stronger dollar on its overseas earnings.

Foreign exchange headwinds have also forced companies such as Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Salesforce (CRM.N) to temper their expectations for the year.

A hawkish Federal Reserve and heightened geopolitical tensions have driven gains in the dollar against a basket of currencies over the last year.

Typically, a stronger dollar eats into the profits of companies that have sprawling international operations and convert foreign currencies into dollars.

Accenture, which makes more than half of its revenue from outside the United States, said it now expects a negative foreign-exchange impact of 4.5% in fiscal 2022, worse than its previous forecast of a 3% forex hit.

Shares of the company fell 2.8% in trading before the bell. They were down about 31% so far this year as fears of aggressive interest rate hikes by the U.S. Fed to tame red-hot inflation led to a sell-off in the tech sector.

After years of muted forex volatility, many companies are now scrambling to protect their earnings from the impacts of currency fluctuation, leading to increased corporate hedging.

Accenture cut the higher end of its annual profit forecast range. It expects fiscal 2022 earnings per share to be in the range of $10.61 to $10.70, compared with its previous estimate of $10.61 to $10.81.

It also forecast fourth-quarter revenue to be in the range of $15.0 billion to $15.5 billion, compared with analysts' average expectation of $15.70 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The forecast reflects the company's assumption of a negative 8% foreign-exchange impact, Accenture said.

Revenue for the quarter ended May 31 was $16.16 billion. Analysts on average had expected $16.03 billion in revenue.

Summary Companies Energy, cyclical sectors lag

Lower bond yields support technology, growth stocks

U.S. business activity slows considerably in June-survey

Indexes up: Dow 0.64%, S&P 0.95%, Nasdaq 1.62%















June 23 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes posted solid gains on Thursday, fueled by strong performance from defensive and tech shares that outweighed declines for economically sensitive groups as worries persisted about a potential recession.

The benchmark S&P 500 swung between positive and negative during the session, but stocks picked up steam heading into the market's close. Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields fell to two-week lows, supporting tech and other rate-sensitive growth stocks.

Trading has remained volatile in the wake of the S&P 500 last week logging its biggest weekly percentage drop since March 2020. Investors are weighing how far stocks could fall after the index earlier this month fell over 20% from its January all-time high, confirming the common definition of a bear market.

“There is a tremendous amount of uncertainty about the outlook and so the market is confused,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in South Carolina.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 194.23 points, or 0.64%, to 30,677.36, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 35.84 points, or 0.95%, to 3,795.73 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 179.11 points, or 1.62%, to 11,232.19.

In his second day of testifying before Congress, U.S. central bank chief Jerome Powell said the Fed's commitment to reining in 40-year-high inflation is ""unconditional"" but also comes with the risk of higher unemployment. read more

U.S. business activity slowed considerably in June as high inflation and declining consumer confidence dampened demand across the board, a survey on Thursday showed.

“The Fed wants to see things start to slow and the data is starting to reflect that,” said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson.

[1/2] A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., June 22, 2022. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid 1 2

Citigroup analysts are forecasting a near 50% probability of a global recession. read more

“Economic growth is slowing. Is it going to slow enough to go into a recession, that’s the big question,” Ragan said.

Defensive groups considered safer bets in rocky economic times were the top-performing S&P 500 sectors. Among them, utilities (.SPLRCU) gained 2.4%, healthcare (.SPXHC) rose 2.2% and real estate (.SPLRCR) added 2%.

The heavyweight tech sector (.SPLRCT) rose 1.4%, with Microsoft (MSFT.O) gaining 2.3% and Apple (AAPL.O) up 2.2%.

The energy sector (.SPNY) slumped 3.8%, continuing its recent pullback after soundly outperforming the market for most of 2022. Declines in Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Chevron (CVX.N) were the biggest individual drags on the S&P 500, with Exxon dropping 3% and Chevron falling 3.7%.

Other economically sensitive sectors also fell. Materials (.SPLRCM) lost 1.4%, while industrials (.SPLRCI) and financials (.SPSY) dipped about 0.5% each.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.41-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.67-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and 40 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 32 new highs and 194 new lows.

About 12.4 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 12.5 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

192,809,Microsoft,2022-06-24,"Column: Markets not braced for Japanese, Swiss central bank liquidity drain","













ORLANDO, Fla., June 23 (Reuters) - If estimates that world markets face a record $4 trillion liquidity drain over the next 18 months are even close to accurate, hold on to your hats.

That's how much analysts at Morgan Stanley reckon G4 central banks - the U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and Bank of England - will shrink their balance sheets by, via quantitative tightening (QT), by the end of next year.

The estimate does not include the Swiss National Bank (SNB), one of the world's biggest liquidity providers of the last decade.

Perhaps even more significant than the SNB's 50 basis point interest rate increase last week was its admission that the franc is reasonably valued, suggesting that currency market intervention of recent years has ended.

If this is the case, the SNB's role as a marginal but steady buyer of U.S. and euro zone bonds, and mega-cap Wall Street stocks, may be over.

The SNB's balance sheet stands at around $1 trillion, up from around $200 billion in 2010. That's an average of around $70 billion injected annually into world markets that could now disappear.

This is a strong signal that even the world's most dovish central banks are changing tack. While we're not there yet, an even bigger shock would be the Bank of Japan (BOJ) calling a day on its 'yield curve control' policy of buying unlimited government bonds to cap the 10-year yield at 0.25%.

In some ways, Morgan Stanley's $4 trillion liquidity drain estimate is even more remarkable in that it predicts the BOJ's contribution will essentially be zero.

""The SNB and BOJ have contributed a very significant liquidity injection over the years that has led to large inflows into asset markets. If it were to stop, for whatever reason, that would be very dramatic,"" said Jens Nordvig, founder and CEO of Exante Data.

'ZIRP' & 'NIRP'

Japan's contribution to global market liquidity - via the BOJ's unparalleled balance sheet expansion, and Japanese investors' purchases of overseas assets - cannot be overstated.

The BOJ has employed zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) and quantitative easing (QE) for years, and the country's large, accumulated current account surpluses have been plowed back into higher-yielding assets abroad.

Japan has long been the world's largest creditor nation and its net stock of foreign assets, accumulated over the last few decades, especially, hit a record $3.24 trillion last year.

The SNB, meanwhile, has gone one better on rates and pushed them below zero - 'NIRP', or negative interest rate policy - and has pumped hundreds of billions of dollars of cash accrued in sustained currency market intervention across swathes of the world's major bond and equity markets.

Unique among major central banks, the SNB is a publicly-traded company, and also a huge investor in overseas stock markets. A quarter of its balance sheet is in foreign stocks, - a record share - much of it on Wall Street in multi-billion dollar stakes in companies like Apple (AAPL.O) , Microsoft and Amazon .

Reuters Image

BREXIT & PLAZA

Some of the world's major stocks and bond markets are having one of their worst first-half-of-the-year performances since the Great Depression, as the Fed has raised rates, signaled more to come and just started reducing its balance sheet via QT.

As the following chart from Exante Data shows, the total amount of bank reserves created by the BOJ and SNB to purchase financial assets towers over all others, as a share of GDP. The BOJ's bank reserves amount to 104% of GDP, and the SNB's 88%.

Reuters Image

The SNB's hawkish pivot will ultimately halt the build up of 'sight deposits' via franc-weakening currency intervention, and the Nasdaq's 30% slump this year could dampen its appetite for adding to its $177 billion equity portfolio.

As far as Japan goes, investors' purchases of foreign stocks and bonds since 'Abenomics' was launched in 2013 have totaled around $15-$20 billion a month on a 12-month moving average basis, peaking in 2016.

Last year, however, they were sellers of foreign stocks and their bond purchases slowed further. As Exante Data notes, they have resumed modest purchases of foreign equities again this year, but have become sellers of foreign bonds.

Reuters Image

But the yen has just hit a 24-year low against the dollar around 136 yen , and by some measures is the weakest in 50 years on a real effective exchange rate measure. If inflation pressures in Japan finally become embedded, the impact of a potential BOJ pivot would be huge.

""At some point, they are going to have to exit, and when they do it is going to be like one of these days that people remember in their careers, like Brexit, or for the older bears out there, Plaza,"" said Marc Chandler, managing director at Bannockburn Global Forex, referring to Britain's departure from the European Union in 2016 and the G5 coordinated effort to weaken the dollar in 1985.

June 24 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O)accepts the outcome of a vote by Maryland store workers to become its first U.S. employees to join a union and is ready to bargain with them, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.

Apple is one of several major American companies whose workforces have moved to unionize, with workers at some Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and Amazon Inc (AMZN.O) locations also voting to join a union in recent months.

Nearly two-thirds of the employees at the Apple store in Towson, Maryland who organized as the Coalition of Organized Retail Employees (CORE), voted to join a union last week. The store is the first of Apple's roughly 270 U.S. outlets to do so.

The successful vote came after another planned vote in Georgia was called off earlier this year.

Apple intends to participate in the bargaining process in ""good faith,"" the person familiar with the matter said.

The Maryland employees voted to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM).

In a statement, David Sullivan, the union's eastern territory vice president, said the members ""look forward to bargaining with Apple and obtaining a strong first contract that makes positive changes for Apple workers and the customers they are proud to serve.""

Companies have responded to employee efforts to organize in different ways.

Amazon challenged the outcome of a plan to unionize at a warehouse in New York City, while Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O)President Brad Smith said in a blog post earlier this month that his company will not resist efforts by employees to organize.

Apple employees at a store in Georgia earlier this year had plans to vote on unionization but canceled the vote, with union officers later filing a complaint alleging Apple intimidated its employees. Employees at two other Apple stores in New York are also considering unionization.

194,777,Microsoft,2022-06-24,"Disney, other U.S. companies offer abortion travel benefit after Roe decision","













NEW YORK, June 24 (Reuters) - U.S. companies including Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) said on Friday they will cover employees' expenses if they have to travel for abortion services after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday overturned the landmark 1973 ruling that recognized a woman's constitutional right to an abortion, handing a victory to Republicans and religious conservatives who want to limit or ban and, in some states criminalize, the procedure. read more

Many states are expected to further restrict or ban abortions following the ruling, making it difficult for female employees to terminate pregnancies unless they travel to states where the procedure is allowed.

For example, in Oklahoma a bill due to take effect in August bans abortion except in medical emergencies and penalizes providers who violate the law with up to $100,000 in fines and 10 years in prison. States offering abortion protections include New York and Maryland. read more

Disney told employees on Friday that it remains committed to providing comprehensive access to quality healthcare, including for abortions, according to a Disney spokesperson. read more

The company's benefits will cover the cost of employees who need to travel to another location to access care, including to obtain an abortion, it said.

Facebook owner Meta will reimburse travel expenses for employees seeking out-of-state reproductive care, but the company was also ""assessing how best to do so given the legal complexities involved,"" according to a spokesperson.

But Meta also moved to limit internal discussion of the ruling. Moderators on its forum Workplace removed posts mentioning abortion, citing a ""respectful communications"" policy barring employee discussions of political topics, according to a LinkedIn post by a Meta employee in Seattle.

Moderators also took down links to Facebook posts by outgoing Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg that condemned the ruling, the employee wrote.

The Meta spokesperson declined to comment on internal policy when asked about the reports of limiting internal discussion.

Policies supporting abortions varied among companies.

Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS.N) Chief Executive Lauren Hobart said on LinkedIn that the company would pay up to $4,000 in travel for employees or their family members and a support person if abortion was not available nearby.

Companies that offer reimbursements for abortion-related travel could be vulnerable to lawsuits by anti-abortion groups and Republican-led states, and even potential criminal penalties.

Lawyers and other experts said employers could face claims that their policies violate state laws banning, facilitating or aiding and abetting abortions.

Ride hailing company Lyft (LYFT.O) said it would legally shield drivers in abortion cases, saying it would expand a recent policy as new state laws were passed. ""No driver should have to ask a rider where they are going and why,"" a spokesperson said.

A draft of the Supreme Court ruling on abortion was leaked in May. At that time, many other companies, including online review site Yelp (YELP.N), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), and Tesla (TSLA.O), said they would help cover the cost of travel for employees seeking reproductive services. Apple (AAPL.O) repeated that it supported employees making their own decisions on reproductive health and that its healthcare covered travel for services unavailable nearby.

Yelp co-founder and Chief Executive Jeremy Stoppelman on Friday said the ruling ""puts women's health in jeopardy, denies them their human rights, and threatens to dismantle the progress we've made toward gender equality in the workplace since Roe.""

Alaska Air Group (ALK.N), parent of Alaska Airlines, said on Friday it is ""reimbursing travel for certain medical procedures and treatments if they are not available where you live. Today's Supreme Court decision does not change that.""

Other companies offering the benefit include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), online dating sites OkCupid and Bumble Inc (BMBL.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the nation's largest bank. read more

OkCupid sent in-app messages to customers in 26 states likely to ban abortions, gearing up for a political fight. ""Act now by calling your representatives and demanding freedom and choice,"" said a copy of the message tweeted by OkCupid Chief Marketing Officer Melissa Hobley.

195,467,Microsoft,2022-06-24,Analysis: Swiss policy pivot signals exit for big stock and bond investor,"Summary

Summary Companies Central bank no longer sees Swiss franc as ""highly valued""

Had invested FX bought to weaken the currency

May start unwinding its huge stock and bond holdings

SNB says would seek to minimise any market impact















LONDON, June 24 (Reuters) - From Silicon Valley shares to U.S. and European government bonds, securities that are already under heavy pressure stand to lose a major buyer as Switzerland ends its long-standing policy of recycling euros and dollars into foreign markets.

The Swiss National Bank recently delivered a surprise half-point interest rate hike and for the first time in years omitted references in its statement to the franc being highly valued.

The shift is a momentous one, suggesting the SNB will no longer prioritise weakening the currency by purchasing foreign exchange - a policy that enabled it to build a reserve pile of nearly $1 trillion.

Unlike most central banks, it recycled these proceeds of intervention into world markets rather than holding them at home, making it a huge stock and bond investor. In recent years it ranked among the top shareholders in the likes of Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. read more

Any reduction in its purchases, or an eventual move towards selling - a possibility after the bank said it is also ready to check a weakening of the franc - risks heightening volatility on already shaky markets.

""The SNB's departure from its previous approach to keep the franc weak means they will unwind their large U.S. stock holdings, particularly in FAANGS, which should increase selling pressure on these mega-cap names,"" said Kaspar Hense, senior portfolio manager at Bluebay Asset Management, referring to the tech quintet of Facebook (Meta), Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google.

The SNB had already cut back forex buying in recent weeks, as evidenced by a drop in ""total sight deposits"" at Swiss banks that are seen as a proxy for intervention. These deposits declined by 1.3 billion Swiss francs in the week ending June 17, versus a rise of 756 million francs a month earlier and an increase of nearly 6 billion francs in early April.

The SNB said it would seek to minimise the market impact whether it were to let existing bonds expire or actively sell assets, with the focus remaining on the overall liquidity of the portfolio.

With inflation above the SNB's target, the franc has been allowed to rise to seven-year highs against the euro , briefly pushing beyond one franc per euro in March. It has performed less well against the dollar , which has soared on expectations of aggressive policy tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve.

FAANGs

The SNB's recent policy shift is not quite on a par with its shock decision in 2015 to ditch the franc's euro exchange rate peg. But tighter policy and its potential step back from markets coincides with a deepening market selloff that has sent global stocks to a 21% loss this year.

Bond yields have also surged as inflation hits multi-decade highs, prompting steep rate hikes.

""In isolation, the impact (of potential asset sales) would have been limited but it comes in the middle of a sharp re-pricing and lower market liquidity so the effect will likely be magnified,"" said ING senior rates strategist Antoine Bouvet.

It is difficult to gauge accurately the impact of any investment pullback, as the SNB does not provide a breakdown of exactly which assets it holds in each currency.

SNB data does show that a quarter of its FX reserves were in equities as of end-March.

At that time, U.S. regulatory filings show the SNB's U.S. equity portfolio was worth $177 billion, including $12.4 billion in Apple shares, $9.5 billion in Microsoft and $6.4 billion in Amazon. Other holdings included $1.5 billion in Exxon Mobil and $1.1 billion in Coca Cola.

The SNB also holds 600 billion francs in foreign government bonds, making up 64% of FX reserves, according to Reuters calculations from SNB data.

Assuming bonds make up the same share of holdings in each currency as they do across its entire FX portfolio, Reuters calculations show that might include some $248 billion of U.S. Treasuries and 221 billion euros of euro zone government debt - most of it likely to be in top-rated bonds like Germany's.

""Their activities have been quite large over the last few years, and we did see in general increased euro holdings by central banks, and the SNB is one of them,"" BofA strategist Sphia Salim said. She predicted pressure on short-dated German bonds.

Unsurprisingly, last week's policy pivot sent euro zone and U.S. bond yields surging. read more

If the SNB were to wind down bond holdings, it would first stop reinvesting the proceeds of maturing bonds, Lyn Graham-Taylor, senior rates strategist at Rabobank said. That could see the SNB drop nearly 5 billion euros of German government debt by year-end, he estimates.

In 2023, ""you'll get those concerns around the SNB potentially selling bonds, merged with higher issuance next year and the potential for ECB QT,"" BofA's Salim said - a reference to expectations the European Central Bank may eventually start reducing its own balance sheet, a process known as Quantitative Tightening.

Summary Companies Rising crude prices boost energy stocks

Durable goods, pending home sales surprise to the upside

Indexes down: Dow 0.2%, S&P 0.3%, Nasdaq 0.8%















NEW YORK, June 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed lower on Monday, with few catalysts to sway investor sentiment as they approach the half-way point of a year in which the equity markets have been slammed by heightened inflation worries and tightening Fed policy. read more

The major U.S. stock indexes lost ground after oscillating earlier in the session, with weakness in interest rate sensitive megacaps such as Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) providing the heaviest drag.

""The reason for lack of direction this week and next week is investors are looking for what’s going to happen in the second quarter reporting period,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York.

All three indexes are on course to notch two straight quarterly declines for the first time since 2015. They also appear set to post losses for June, which would mark three consecutive down months for the tech-heavy Nasdaq, its longest losing streak since 2015.

The S&P was on track to report its fifth worst year-to-date price decline since 1962 as of Friday, Stovall said.

""Every time the SPX rose by more than 20% in a year it fell by an average of 11% starting relatively early in the new year. And all years where the decline started in the first half got back to break even before the year was out.""

""No guarantee that’s going to happen this year, but the market could surprise us to the upside,"" Stovall said.

Rising oil prices helped put energy stocks (.SPNY) out front, with economically sensitive smallcaps (.RUT) and semiconductors (.SOX) and transports (.DJT) also outperforming the broader market.

Economic data surprised to the upside, with new orders for durable goods and pending home sales beating expectations and adding credence to U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's assertion that the economy is robust enough to withstand the central bank's attempts to rein in decades-high inflation without sliding into recession. read more

Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, eight ended the session in negative territory, with consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) suffering the largest percentage loss. Energy stocks were the clear winners, gaining 2.8% on the day.

With several weeks to go until second-quarter reporting commences, 130 S&P 500 companies have pre-announced. Of those, 45 have been positive and 77 have been negative, resulting in a negative/positive ratio of 1.7 stronger than the first quarter but weaker than a year ago, according to Refinitiv data.

In extended trading, Robinhood Markets (HOOD.O) fell 4% after FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried said his cryptocurrency exchange was in no active M&A conversations with the retail stock trading platform.

In the earlier trading session, Robinhood had jumped 14% after Bloomberg reported that FTX was exploring a deal. read more

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.17-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and 29 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 24 new highs and 84 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.91 billion shares, compared with the 12.95 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

198,12,Microsoft,2022-06-28,Microsoft faces investor call to publish global tax affairs,"













LONDON, June 28 (Reuters) - Investors managing more than $350 billion of assets have demanded that Microsoft (MSFT.O) publish more transparent tax and financial information, as tech giants face growing scrutiny globally over their tax affairs.

A shareholder resolution on tax transparency had been filed to Microsoft ahead of its annual investor meeting this year, said the organiser of the action, Britain-based proxy advisers Pensions & Investment Research Consultants (PIRC).

Investors including Nordea, AkademikerPension and Greater Manchester Pension Fund had backed the resolution, PIRC said.

The resolution calls on the company to publish financial and tax information on a country-by-country basis outside its home market of the United States so investors can assess whether it is paying fair taxes and identify any risks posed by tax reforms.

It also calls on Microsoft to produce a tax transparency report in line with the tax standard of the Global Reporting Initiative, a standards organisation.

A similar resolution has also been filed to tech giant Cisco (CSCO.O), PIRC said.

Investors voted on a tax transparency resolution at Amazon's investor meeting in May, but it and other investor-led resolutions failed to get sufficient support to pass. read more

Microsoft and Cisco were not immediately available for comment.

199,543,Microsoft,2022-06-28,Climate tech firm to launch scaled-up plant sucking CO2 from air,"













BRUSSELS, June 28 (Reuters) - Construction is due to begin on Wednesday on what could become the world's biggest plant to capture carbon dioxide from the air and deposit it underground, the company behind the nascent green technology said.

Swiss start-up Climeworks AG said its second large-scale direct air capture (DAC) plant will be built in Iceland in 18-24 months, and have capacity to suck 36,000 tonnes of CO2 per year from the air.

That is a sliver of the 36 billion tonnes of energy-related CO2 emissions produced worldwide last year. But it is a 10-fold increase from Climeworks' existing DAC plant, currently the world's largest, and a leap in scale for a technology that scientists this year said is ""unavoidable"" if the world is to meet climate change goals. read more

The new ""Mammoth"" plant will contain around 80 large blocks of fans and filters that suck in air and extract its CO2, which Icelandic carbon storage firm Carbfix then mixes with water and injects underground where a chemical reaction turns it to rock. The process will be powered by a nearby geothermal energy plant.

Co-CEO Christoph Gebald said once this plant launches, Climeworks intends to build a far bigger facility capturing roughly half a million tonnes of CO2 per year - and then replicate multiple plants of that size, backed by project financing, towards the end of the decade.

Mammoth was part-financed by a 600 million Swiss Franc ($627 million) financing round Climeworks announced in April. The firm also sells among the world's most expensive carbon removal credit - costing up to 1,000 euros per tonne - to buyers including Microsoft, Audi and Boston Consulting Group.

""It's the cost of scaling up,"" Gebald told Reuters. ""This is, so to say, the investment we have to do as a company to move forward.""

The world currently has 18 direct air capture facilities, according to the International Energy Agency. U.S. oil firm Occidental also plans to launch a large-scale DAC facility, in late-2024, to collect 1 million tonnes per year of CO2.

The U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said energy-intensive and costly technologies like DAC will be needed to remove CO2 on a large scale in the coming decades, to limit global warming to 1.5C and avoid increasingly severe climate impacts.

Heleen De Coninck, an IPCC author and professor at Eindhoven University of Technology, said DAC must be powered by CO2-free energy to be useful, and should not replace urgent reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

""It can backfire if it leads to avoiding doing what’s necessary right now,"" she said.

REUTERS/Caitlin Ochs















NEW YORK, June 30 (Reuters) - A nearly $17 billion JP Morgan fund is expected to reset its options positions on Thursday, potentially adding to equity volatility at the end of a dismal first half for stocks.

Analysts say the JPMorgan Hedged Equity Fund’s reset roiled markets in the closing hours of the last quarter and has the potential to move markets again this time around. read more

Here is what you need to know:

WHAT IS THE JP MORGAN HEDGED EQUITY FUND?

The JPMorgan Hedged Equity Fund holds a basket of S&P 500 (.SPX) stocks along with options on the benchmark index and resets hedges once a quarter. The fund, which had about $16.71 billion in assets as of June 27, aims to let investors benefit from equity market gains while limiting their exposure to stock declines.

For the year, the fund was down 9.7% through June 29, compared with a 19.3% decline for the S&P 500 Total return Index (.SPXTR).

Its assets have ballooned in recent years, as investors seek protection from the sort of wild swings that rocked markets in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020.

The fund's positions include some of the market's biggest names, such as shares of Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).

HOW DOES THE FUND USE OPTIONS?

The fund uses an options overlay strategy that involves buying put options that make money if the S&P 500 drops about 5% or more from its level at the start of each quarter. To limit the cost of these put purchases, the fund also sells puts that would make money if the S&P 500 drops more than 20%.

In addition, the fund sells call options struck about 3.5%-5.5% above the market level, to help fund the cost of the hedge.

In all, the trade is structured so that investors are protected if the market falls -5% to -20%, and they are able to take advantage of any market gains in the average range of 3.5-5.5%.

In March, the refresh of these positions involved about 130,000 S&P 500 contracts in all, worth some $20 billion in notional terms.

HOW CAN THIS AFFECT THE BROADER MARKET?

Options dealers - typically big financial institutions who facilitate trading but seek to remain market-neutral - take the other side of the fund's options trades.

To minimize their own risk, they typically buy or sell stock futures, depending on the direction of the market's move. Such trading related to dealer hedging has the potential to influence the broader market, especially if done in size, as is the case for the JPM trade.

The S&P 500 Index (.SPX) fell 1.2% in the last hour of trading on March 31 amid a lack of any obvious news - a move some analysts pinned on options hedging flows. read more

Traders say the refresh could exacerbate market swings on Thursday, as the fund rolls over its options positions and dealers buy and sell futures to hedge their exposure.

Charlie McElligott, equities derivatives strategist at Nomura, believes that all else being equal, more volatility and stock weakness could follow after June 30, once the trade is out of the way.

The strategy's puts corresponding to the 3,620 level on the S&P 500, the lower leg of the trade, may have lent support to the market during its slide this month, he said.

Nike slips on downbeat quarterly revenue forecast

Indexes down: Dow 1.56%, S&P 2.01%, Nasdaq 2.98%















NEW YORK, June 28 (Reuters) - Wall Street closed sharply lower in a broad sell-off on Tuesday as dire consumer confidence data dampened investor optimism and fueled worries over recession and the looming earnings season.

The S&P and the Nasdaq fell about 2% and 3% respectively, with Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) weighing the heaviest. The blue-chip Dow shed about 1.6%.

""Markets were fine today until the consumer confidence number came out,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""It was weak and markets immediately began selling off.""

With the end of the month and the second quarter two days away, the benchmark S&P 500 is on track for its biggest first-half percentage drop since 1970.

All three indexes are on course to notch two straight quarterly declines for the first time since 2015.

""At some point this aggressive selling is going to dissipate but it doesn't seem like it's going to be anytime soon,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist Ingalls & Snyder in New York.

Data released on Tuesday morning showed the Conference Board's consumer confidence index dropping to the lowest it has been since February 2021, with near-term expectations reaching its most pessimistic level in nearly a decade. read more

The growing gap between the Conference Board's ""current situation"" and ""expectations"" components have widened to levels that often precede recession:

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 491.27 points, or 1.56%, to 30,946.99, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 78.56 points, or 2.01%, to 3,821.55 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 343.01 points, or 2.98%, to 11,181.54.

Ten of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 ended the session in negative territory, with consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) suffering the largest percentage loss. Energy (.SPNY) was the sole gainer, benefiting from rising crude prices .

With few market catalysts and market participants gearing up for the July Fourth holiday weekend, the day's sell-off cannot be blamed entirely on the Consumer Confidence report, said Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

""It’s hard to attribute (market volatility) to one economic data point with so much noise around portfolio rebalancing at quarter-end,"" Hainlin said.

""There’s not a lot of new information out there and yet you see this volatile stock environment,"" he said, adding that there will not be much new information until companies start earnings.

With several weeks to go until second-quarter reporting commences, 130 S&P 500 companies have pre-announced. Of those, 45 have been positive and 77 have been negative, resulting in a negative/positive ratio of 1.7 stronger than the first quarter but weaker than a year ago, according to Refinitiv data.

Dow up 0.27%, S&P down 0.07%, Nasdaq off 0.03%















NEW YORK, June 29 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended a seesaw session slightly down on Wednesday as investors staggered toward the finish line of a downbeat month, a dismal quarter, and the worst first-half for Wall Street's benchmark index since President Richard Nixon's first term.

The three major U.S. stock indexes spent much of the session wavering between red and green. The Nasdaq joined the S&P 500, closing nominally lower, while the blue-chip Dow posted a modest gain.

""The market’s struggling to find direction,"" said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors in Hunt Valley, Maryland. ""We had disappointing data, and the markets are waiting for earnings season, when we'll get more clarity"" with respect to future earnings and an economic slowdown.

Market leaders Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) provided the upside muscle, while economically sensitive chips (.SOX) small caps (.RUT) and transports (.DJT) were underperforming the broader market.

With the end of the month and the second quarter a day away, the S&P 500 has set a course for its biggest first-half percentage drop since 1970.

The Nasdaq was on its way to its worst-ever first-half performance, while the Dow appeared on track for its biggest January-June percentage drop since the financial crisis.

All three indexes were bound to post their second straight quarterly declines. That last time that happened was in 2015.

""We have a central bank that has had to pivot from a decades-old easy money policy to a tightening cycle,"" Horneman added. ""This is new for a lot of investors.""

""We’re seeing a repricing for what we expect to be a very different interest rate environment going forward.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 82.32 points, or 0.27%, to 31,029.31, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 2.72 points, or 0.07%, to 3,818.83 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 3.65 points, or 0.03%, to 11,177.89.

Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, five lost ground on the day, with energy stocks (.SPNY) suffering the largest percentage drop. Healthcare (.SPXHC) led the gainers.

Benchmark Treasury yields have risen by over 1.606 percentage points so far in 2022, their biggest first-half jump since 1984. That explains why interest rate sensitive growth stocks (.IGX) have plunged over 26% year-to-date.

In economic news, U.S. Commerce Department data showed GDP contracted slightly more than previously stated in the first three months of the year. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of the economy, contributed substantially less than originally reported. read more

A day earlier, a dire consumer confidence report showed consumer expectations sinking to their lowest level since March 2013.

Second-quarter reporting season remains several weeks away, and 130 of the companies in the S&P 500 have pre-announced. Of those, 45 have been positive and 77 have been negative, resulting in a negative/positive ratio of 1.7 stronger than the first quarter but weaker than a year ago, according to Refinitiv data.

What will investors be listening for in those earnings calls?

""Margin pressures, that’s the big concern, pricing pressures, scaling back plans for capex because of the slowdown, and if they see any improvement in the supply chain,"" Horneman said.

ZURICH, June 29 (Reuters) - Siemens (SIEGn.DE) has signed a partnership agreement with chip designer Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) to create an industrial metaverse - an enhanced virtual reality for companies to reduce the costs of running their factories, buildings and speed up new product design.

The deal is a cornerstone of Siemens Xcelerator, a new open digital platform also launched by the German technology and engineering company on Wednesday.

The cloud-based platform, which will feature hardware, software and digital services, is part of Siemens' ambition to grow its digital business by 10% per year from the 5.6 billion euros ($5.89 billion) generated in 2021.

""Siemens Xcelerator will make it easier than ever before for companies to navigate digital transformation – faster and at scale,"" Siemens Chief Executive Roland Busch said in a statement.

Siemens, which bought Brightly Software for $1.58 billion on Monday, is moving further into the digital space because it offers faster growth rates and higher margins than its traditional business of trains and industrial drives and automation. read more

Siemens and Nvidia are just two of the companies which are working in the so-called metaverse, which refers broadly to the idea of a shared virtual platform that people can access through different devices and where they can move through digital environments.

Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (META.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) and others are also looking at metaverse technology can be used in business and leisure.

Siemens's Xcelerator will be the umbrella term for services which will allow customers to visualise yachts or factories, for example, before construction starts.

""We can essentially replace having to build a thing in the real world first,"" Tony Hemmelgarn, CEO of Siemens Digital Industries Software, told reporters.

The platform would also ensure products ""are going to work well, before we commit to building them in the real world when it becomes really expensive and difficult to change,"" he added.

The services will be offered to customers through Siemens's software as a service (SaaS) subscription model, to make it more affordable for small and medium sized companies.

As part of the collaboration, Siemens will connect Xcelerator and its own software and digital twin products with Nvidia's Omniverse, a platform for 3D design.

204,282,Microsoft,2022-06-30,Supermarket chain Wegmans settles with New York over data breach,"













NEW YORK, June 30 (Reuters) - The supermarket chain Wegmans agreed to pay $400,000 and upgrade its security practices over a data breach that exposed personal information of more than 3 million consumers nationwide, New York Attorney General Letitia James said on Thursday.

Wegmans was accused of storing customer information in cloud storage containers hosted on Microsoft Azure that were left open because they had been misconfigured, leaving the data vulnerable to hackers.

James said customers' email addresses and Wegmans account passwords were exposed for about 39 months, while customers' names, mailing addresses and data tied to their driver's license numbers were exposed for about 30 months.

The breach occurred from 2018 until the spring of 2021. Wegmans began alerting customers whose information was compromised in June 2021. More than 830,000 New Yorkers were affected.

""In the 21st century, there's no excuse for companies to have poor cybersecurity systems and practices that hurt consumers,"" James said in a statement.

Wegmans said it takes the security of customers' data very seriously, and there was no indication anyone misused that data.

""While we do not agree with some of the conclusions drawn by the attorney general, we cooperated fully in the investigation and are glad it has been concluded,"" Wegmans said in a statement.

Wegmans is based in Rochester, New York. It said it has 108 stores in New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Washington, D.C., Virginia and North Carolina.

June 30 (Reuters) - China's slowing economy and an inflation-driven drop in consumer spending are expected to drag down global shipments of computers and smartphones this year, according to research firm Gartner.

Shipments to China - the world's biggest smartphone market - are expected to shrink by 18% as demand takes a beating from strict COVID-19 curbs that halted activity in key economic hubs including Shanghai, Gartner said in a report on Thursday.

The research firm expects a 7% drop in worldwide smartphone shipments, also reflecting the expected toll of supply chain snarls and the Russia-Ukraine conflict on demand.

""A perfect storm of geopolitics upheaval, high inflation, currency fluctuations and supply chain disruptions have lowered business and consumer demand for devices across the world, and is set to impact the PC market the hardest in 2022,"" said Ranjit Atwal, senior director analyst at Gartner.

Gartner expects global computer shipments to drop 9.5% this year.

The forecast mirrors commentary from industry players, with chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) saying earlier this month that the PC market was set for a slowdown after two ""very strong"" years. read more

The soft demand for PCs and smartphones is likely to weigh on companies from chipmakers such as Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) to mega-cap tech firms including Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). Those companies are set to report second-quarter earnings starting next month.

206,373,Microsoft,2022-06-30,OVHcloud sets higher annual revenue target after Q3 boost,"













June 30 (Reuters) - French cloud services provider OVHcloud (OVH.PA) on Thursday raised its full-year revenue growth objective, as commercial momentum in its private and public cloud segments boosted third-quarter sales.

Europe's leading cloud provider now expects its revenue to grow between 16% and 18% in the twelve months to Aug. 31, compared with its earlier estimate of 15% to 17%.

Cloud computing services have seen their demand soar in recent years, becoming a major driver of growth for big tech companies such as Amazon (AMZN.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google.

OVHcloud, which made its market debut in October in one of Paris' biggest new listings of 2021, saw its third-quarter revenue increase by 25% to 202 million euros ($211 million), or 11.7% on a like-for-like basis.

The figure excludes direct impacts of the fire that in March last year took down four of its data centres in Strasbourg, the group said.

""This good performance reflects the group's ability to gain new customers, primarily in Public Cloud and Private Cloud, as well as the success of its international development,"" Chief Executive Officer Michel Paulin said in a statement.

Revenues of OVHcloud's private and public cloud segments reported like-for-like growth of 14.6% and 19.4%, respectively, both showing gains in average revenues per active customer.

The group maintained its full-year core profit (EBITDA) margin target of close to 40%, as well as its 2025 guidance.

PARIS, June 30 (Reuters) - French defence company Thales (TCFP.PA) said on Thursday it has created a new firm, dubbed S3NS, in partnership with Google to offer state-vetted cloud computing services for the storage of some of the country's most sensitive data.

The new company is the result of an alliance sealed last year between Thales, Europe's largest defence electronics supplier, and Alphabet unit (GOOGL.O) Google, following a government plan under which France acknowledged U.S. technological superiority. read more

Google and Microsoft, along with market leader Amazon.com's (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services, dominate cloud computing worldwide, which has led to concerns in Europe over the risk of surveillance by the United States.

The French government has said that cloud computing services developed by Google and Microsoft (MSFT.O) could be used to store France's most sensitive state and corporate data, provided the data centres were located in the country and the services licensed to French companies.

S3NS is majority-owned by Thales, which has full control over the commercialisation of the services developed by Google, it said. Google's stake wasn't disclosed.

Some of France's biggest banks and healthcare organisations are among 40 potential customers of the new company, said Thales' head of secure communications and information systems Marc Darmon.

S3NS' cloud services will be available from the second half of 2024, after it receives the blessing of France's cybersecurity agency ANSSI via a so-called ""trusted cloud"" label, Thales said.

The company will operate three France-based data centres on which Google's vetted and secured cloud services will be run, Thales said.

S3NS will compete against Bleu, a joint company to be set up by the end of the year by IT consulting firm Capgemini (CAPP.PA) and telecoms group Orange (ORAN.PA) which aims to use Microsoft's cloud technology.

Several French cloud services companies have already received the ANSSI label, dubbed SecNumCloud, such as OVHcloud (OVH.PA), Dassault Systemes' Outscale (DAST.PA) and Oodrive.

Several companies have criticised the cloud computing offerings developed by Thales and Orange in collaboration with bigger U.S. rivals, casting doubt over their capacity to provide fully secured services to strategic companies.

208,466,Microsoft,2022-07-01,Analysis: Some investors bet top growth stocks will thrive in U.S. recession,"[1/2] A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., June 27, 2022. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo















NEW YORK, July 1 (Reuters) - Concerns about a possible U.S. recession are prompting some fund managers to rotate back into the big tech and growth winners of the last decade in the hope that they can better weather an economic storm.

Many stalwarts like Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Apple and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) have suffered declines on par with or exceeding those in broader stock indexes this year, as jumbo rate hikes delivered by an inflation-fighting Federal Reserve hit the tech and growth names that led markets in previous years.

Since growth companies tend to be less affected by the broader economy’s performance, however, some investors believe the category’s most profitable names may outperform the rest of the market if the Fed’s hawkish policy stance drags the U.S. into recession.

""You are starting to see some cracks in economic growth, which will help select companies that are very well positioned in the technology space,"" said Saira Malik, chief investment officer at Nuveen, who has been increasing her positions in companies including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N).

""The conceptual companies that don't have profitability will continue to be challenged because you need real fundamentals to back it up,"" she said.

The trade is still a nascent one. Global fund managers have increased their allocations to tech by approximately seven basis points as measured by the latest survey from BofA Global Research, although they remain bearish on the sector as a whole.

Retail investors, meanwhile, have been buying ""evergreen large tech companies"" such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on recent market dips, according to Vanda Research.

Overall, the Russell 1000 Growth index (.RLG) is down 28.4% year-to-date, well behind the 13.9% decline for the Russell 1000 Value index (.RLV), which contains stocks in more economically-sensitive sectors like energy. The benchmark S&P 500 index is down 20.7%, marking its worst first-half of the year since 1970. read more

Some names in tech have suffered even steeper losses: Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK.P), which holds an array of newer companies including Zoom Video Communications and Teladoc, is down 57.7% year-to-date. read more

Meanwhile, recession worries have grown in recent weeks. A global poll of investors by Deutsche Bank in June found that 90% now expect a U.S. recession by the end of 2023, up from 78% the month before.

'ATTRACTIVE VALUATIONS'

For Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, those concerns are a good reason to increase positions in companies such as Google-parent Alphabet. Janasiewicz is also betting that the pounding their shares have taken has lowered valuations to attractive levels.

The forward price to earnings ratio for the S&P 500 technology sector, for instance, is down to 19.1, its lowest level since early 2020, according to Yardeni Research.

""We are seeing some of the most attractive valuations for this space that we've seen in a long time,"" Janasiewicz said.

Of course, signs of continued high inflation could further ramp up expectations for Fed hawkishness, potentially driving up bond yields and dealing another blow to tech and growth stocks.

Higher yields dull the allure of companies in technology and other high-growth sectors, whose cash flows are often heavily weighted in the future and are diminished when discounted at higher rates.

Earnings season, which kicks off in July, may present another risk. One important factor for tech companies is likely to be the strength of the dollar, which cuts into profits from overseas earnings. Microsoft cited the strong dollar when it cut forecasts June 2. read more

""We think a better approach for global investors is to stay diversified and rely upon stock selection to extract value from markets,"" said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Allspring Global Investments.

Others, however, are betting that a tech bounce may be ahead.

Signs that commodity prices may have peaked could pave the way for the Fed to pull back from its aggressive rate hiking path in September, said Lindsey Houghton, a portfolio manager on Harbor Capital’s Multi-Asset Solutions Team.

Houghton's firm has been selling some of its energy holdings to rotate shares of large technology companies, which he believes could rally by 20% or more a year over the next several years due to their depressed valuations and increasing market share.

""Over the last two months, those valuations have started to get to a point where they look quite attractive to us,"" he said.

BRUSSELS, July 5 (Reuters) - EU lawmakers gave the thumbs up on Tuesday to landmark rules to rein in tech giants such as Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Facebook and Microsoft (MSFT.O), but enforcement could be hampered by regulators' limited resources.

In addition to the rules known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA), lawmakers also approved the Digital Services Act (DSA), which requires online platforms to do more to police the internet for illegal content.

Companies face fines of up to 10% of annual global turnover for DMA violations and 6% for DSA breaches. Lawmakers and EU states had reached a political deal on both rule books earlier this year, leaving some details to be ironed out. read more

The European Commission has set up a taskforce, with about 80 officials expected to join up, which critics say is inadequate. Last month it put out a 12 million euro ($12.3 million) tender for experts to help in investigations and compliance enforcement over a four-year period.

EU industry chief Thierry Breton sought to address enforcement concerns, saying various teams would focus on different issues such as risk assessments, interoperability of messenger services and data access during implementation of the rules.

Regulators will also set up a European Centre for Algorithmic Transparency to attract data science and algorithm scientists to help with enforcement.

""We have started to gear the internal organisation to this new role, including by shifting existing resources, and we also expect to ramp up recruitment next year and in 2024 to staff the dedicated DG CONNECT team with over 100 full time staff,"" Breton said in a blogpost.

DEEP POCKETS

Lawmaker Andreas Schwab, who steered the issue through the European Parliament, has called for a bigger taskforce to counter Big Tech's deep pockets and array of lawyers.

European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) echoed the same worries.

""We raised the alarm last week with other civil society groups that if the Commission does not hire the experts it needs to monitor Big Tech's practices in the market, the legislation could be hamstrung by ineffective enforcement,"" BEUC Deputy Director General Ursula Pachl said in a statement.

The DMA is set to force changes in companies' businesses, requiring them to make their messaging services interoperable and provide business users access to their data.

Business users would be able to promote competing products and services on a platform and reach deals with customers off the platforms.

Companies will not be allow to favour their own services over rivals' or prevent users from removing pre-installed software or apps, two rules that will hit Google and Apple hard.

The DSA bans targeted advertising aimed at children or based on sensitive data such as religion, gender, race and political opinions. Dark patterns, which are tactics that mislead people into giving personal data to companies online, will also be prohibited. ($1 = 0.9754 euros)

210,614,Microsoft,2022-07-05,"Samsung Q2 solid on server-chip demand, smartphones cloud outlook","Summary

Summary Companies Profit likely up 15% to 14.46 trln won -Refinitiv SmartEstimate

That would be highest April-June profit since 2018

Q2 chip earnings likely soared 49% -analysts' est

Mobile business profit likely down about 17% -analysts' est















SEOUL, July 5 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) is likely to turn in its best April-June profit since 2018 with a 15% year-on-year rise, as lingering demand for its memory chips from server customers offsets lower sales to inflation-hit smartphone makers.

Operating profit for the world's biggest smartphone and memory-chip maker likely jumped to 14.46 trillion won ($11.2 billion) in the quarter, according to a Refinitiv SmartEstimate from 24 analysts, from 12.57 trillion won a year earlier.

Its chip earnings likely soared 49% to 10.3 trillion won, an average of seven estimates shows. The chip business accounts for about half of the South Korean tech giant's profits.

On the overall outlook for global memory chip demand, Park Sung-soon, analyst at CAPE Investment & Securities, said U.S. data centre firms such as Amazon (AMZN.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O) and Meta (META.O) are expected to continue buying ""to meet expanding demand for cloud services"".

Chip inventories at these companies are not high compared to 2018 levels, Park added.

Making a case for strong server demand, Taiwanese contract electronics supplier and Apple iPhone maker Foxconn (2317.TW) on Monday raised its full-year outlook and said it was optimistic about the third quarter. read more

Still, chipmakers worldwide are facing cooling demand after two bumper pandemic years when people bought phones and laptops to work remotely, which resulted in a chip shortage and forced companies including automakers to pay top dollar for key chips, pushing their prices up. read more

Also, China's recent COVID-19 lockdowns choked consumer demand and boosted inflation in the world's No.2 economy, resulting in steep falls in smartphone sales. read more

Concerns about a downturn in major markets, including the United States, due to high inflation and the war in Ukraine are also prompting consumers and corporates to tighten budgets.

'WEAKENED CONSIDERABLY'

Rival memory-chipmaker Micron Technology (MU.O) last week forecast much worse-than-expected quarterly revenue and said the market had ""weakened considerably in a very short period of time"", though it was confident about long-term demand. read more

Data provider TrendForce said prices of specific DRAM chips, used in tech devices and servers, fell about 12% last month from a year earlier, signalling smaller margins for chipmakers in coming quarters.

Samsung's mobile business profit is expected to have slipped some 17% to 2.7 trillion won from a year earlier, analysts said.

They expect the company's smartphone shipments to have dropped to between 61 million and 68 million units in the second quarter, from 74 million in the first.

Industrywide shipments of smartphones to China - the world's biggest smartphone market - are expected to shrink by 18% this year, according to Gartner.

Shares in Samsung, which will announce preliminary results on Thursday, have fallen about 27% this year, versus a 38% slump in the Philadelphia Semiconductor index (.SOX).

211,756,Microsoft,2022-07-05,Ex-TikTok gaming head to launch blockchain games startup as big players keep away,"[1/3] Jason Fung, former head of TikTok's gaming unit who left the company to start a blockchain gaming startup called Meta0, poses after an interview with Reuters in Hong Kong, China July 5, 2022. REUTERS/Lam Yik















HONG KONG, July 5 (Reuters) - The former head of short video giant TikTok's gaming unit, Jason Fung, is launching a blockchain gaming startup as one of two co-founders, he told Reuters in an interview, as the buzz around blockchain games grows while sector heavyweights remain wary.

The 34-year-old left TikTok last month after two years with the firm, and his exit comes as TikTok and its Chinese owner ByteDance have been aggressively expanding into the $300 billion dollar global gaming market to take on rival Tencent Holdings (0700.HK), an effort that has yielded mixed results so far.

It also reflects ballooning interest among entrepreneurs and investors in blockchain games - a new generation of online games built on blockchains which allow players to trade items in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Fung, whose new venture is called Meta0, said he left TikTok after seeing an opportunity to offer a solution to the current segregated nature of infrastructure options available to developers looking to build blockchain games.

""Right now, if you look at any developer when they implement NFTs or blockchain in their games, they have to choose a single blockchain, be it Polygon or Solana or Binance Smart Chain. But imagine a more interoperable option,"" he told Reuters in Hong Kong, referring to popular existing blockchains.

""So we decided, let's do it. Let's co-found this company. Let's give up my cushy corporate life at TikTok and take a giant risk,"" said Fung, who was based in Shenzhen and had reported to TikTok's chief operating officer Vanessa Pappas.

Meta0's founding team comprises six members in addition to the two co-founders, and the firm has closed a first round of funding, said Fung.

He declined to disclose details of the other co-founder, the rest of the team or the investment. He said the company was looking to raise funds through issuing tokens, as well as from venture capitalists and strategic investors.

BIG NAMES STEER CLEAR

Advocates of blockchain games say they will disrupt the gaming industry as cryptocurrencies can make virtual items more transactable and even distribute games' ownership to players. But blockchain games are sometimes also associated with scams, and the virtual economies of some games have collapsed soon after players buy in. read more

Most established gaming companies like Tencent, Sony (6758.T) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) have yet to place any big bets on blockchain games.

Fung, as TikTok's global head of strategy and operations for gaming, was tasked with expanding gaming content and testing new features such as hosting mini-games on the app.

TikTok and ByteDance expanded aggressively into gaming during Fung's tenure, with ByteDance's acquisitions including a $4 billion purchase of gaming studio Moonton, and TikTok trying out mini-game features on its app. read more

The efforts have seen both successes and setbacks. Last month, data tracking firm Sensor Tower said ByteDance's portfolio of mobile games had generated more than $1 billion of revenue worldwide over the past 12 months.

However, ByteDance also disbanded its Shanghai-based 101 Studio last month, laying off half of the 300-plus staff. A product of its 2019 acquisition of Mokun Technology, 101 Studio was the first development unit ByteDance has shut down as it struggled to perform.

Fung, who led the e-sports units in Alibaba Group Holding (9988.HK) and Electronic Arts (EA.O) in Asia before joining TikTok, declined to comment when asked about who might replace him at TikTok.

TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

BLOCKCHAIN GAMES A HOT INVESTMENT TREND

Despite the wariness of some in the industry, blockchain games have become one of the hottest investment trends discussed by crypto tycoons from Silicon Valley to Dubai.

Prior to the recent crypto market meltdown, the blockchain gaming industry had raised a record $1.2 billion in the first quarter, according to a report by investment banking firm Drake Star Partners in April. Last year, a total of $3.6 billion was raised for the sector.

""We've built a protocol for game developers, and we take a flexible, blockchain-agnostic approach to their game development,"" said Fung, discussing future prospects for blockchain gaming.

""With a protocol that we're developing, developers can easily build their game-leveraging strengths of different blockchains, and allow the user the flexibility of transferring their NFTs cross-chain.""

Mandatory Credit: Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports















July 5 (Reuters) - The NBA's Portland Trail Blazers and NFL's Seattle Seahawks will not be put up for sale anytime soon, owner Jody Allen said on Tuesday.

Jody Allen took control of both franchises after her brother Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft, died in 2018, leading to speculation that she would put the teams up for sale.

""As chair of both the Portland Trail Blazers and the Seattle Seahawks, my long-term focus is building championship teams that our communities are proud of,"" Allen said in a statement.

""Like my brother Paul, I trust and expect our leaders and coaches to build winning teams that deliver results on and off the court and field.

""As we've stated before, neither of the teams is for sale and there are no sales discussions happening.""

Allen added that she will eventually direct her brother's wealth to philanthropic causes - as he said he wanted - but added that it could take 10 to 20 years to wind down the estate given its size and complexity.

""There is no pre-ordained timeline by which the teams must be sold,"" she said.

""Until then my focus - and that of our teams - is on winning.""

The Blazers, who last won a championship in 1977, were considered the more likely of the two franchises to be sold and potentially moved out of the Pacific Northwest city, leading to anxiety among the team's loyal fanbase.

The equally beloved Seahawks' lone Super Bowl victory came in 2014.

213,605,Microsoft,2022-07-05,Sullivan & Cromwell leads first-half M&A in slower 2022 for firm dealmakers,"Summary Sullivan & Cromwell advised on $356 billion in total deal value

Goodwin advised on 553 deals

M&A activity fell 21% in first half of 2022 from 2021















(Reuters) - Sullivan & Cromwell and Goodwin Procter have taken top spots among law firms advising on global M&A deals in the first half of 2022, as dealmaking continues to drop following last year's highs.

Global M&A activity dipped 21% to a total of $2.2 trillion in the first half of the year compared to the same period in 2021, according to new data from Refinitiv.

M&A activity has slowed amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February and growing fears of a future economic recession.

New York-founded Sullivan & Cromwell advised on $356 billion worth of announced deals in the first half of 2022, the most by total dollar value of any firm.

The firm also handled the highest total dollar amount of deals last year.

Sullivan & Cromwell advised on 88 deals so far in 2022. The firm advised First Horizon Corp in its $13.4 billion acquisition by Toronto-Dominion Bank Group and Biohaven Pharmacuetical Holding Co in its $11.6 billion acquisition by Pfizer Inc.

Melissa Sawyer, global head of Sullivan & Cromwell's M&A group, said in an emailed statement companies are seeing dealmaking benefits ""despite the challenging regulatory environment and the volatility in macro indicators.""

The Refinitiv data includes all deals on which the firms advised, not just those for which they were principal advisor.

Simpson Thacher & Bartlett took the No. 2 spot by total deal value in the first half of the year, advising on 111 deals worth $325.3 billion.

The New York-founded firm worked on major deals including Microsoft Corp's bid to buy video game maker Activision Blizzard Inc for $68.7 billion, the largest announced M&A transaction so far this year.

Boston-founded Goodwin advised on 553 announced deals in the first half of the year, the highest number of any law firm, according to Refinitiv data.

Kirkland & Ellis followed Goodwin with 410 deals in the same period, the data showed.

Law firms saw high demand for corporate work in 2021, when total M&A activity reached a new peak of more than $5.9 trillion for the year. Many large firms rapidly hired associates, offering rounds of bonuses and salary raises to attract and retain talent.

Firms are still hiring, albeit at a slower pace, but are ""getting more picky,"" said Stephanie Biderman of legal recruiting firm Major, Lindsey & Africa.

Despite the M&A slowdown and economic clouds on the horizon, law firms so far don't appear to be talking about cutting headcount, according to Biderman and two law firm consultants.

They said firms will avoid losing too many deal lawyers, as even an extended M&A slump will eventually reverse.

Still, law firms may have to make some adjustments.

""You put unprecedented [compensation] together with lower, potentially substantially lower hours, and it's just tough to square without changing something,"" said Bruce MacEwen of law firm consultancy Adam Smith Esq.

214,675,Microsoft,2022-07-06,"Chips drive highest Samsung Q2 profit since 2018, but demand cooling","Summary

Summary Companies Server chip demand remains solid on cloud appetite -analysts

Smartphone demand slows as inflation rises -analysts

Strong dollar likely aided profits -analysts















SEOUL, July 7 (Reuters) - South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) turned in its best April-June profit since 2018 on Thursday, underpinned by strong sales of memory chips to server customers even as demand from inflation-hit smartphone makers cools.

Shares of the world's largest memory-chip and smartphone maker closed up 3.2% after preliminary results were announced, versus a 1.8% rise in the wider market (.KS11).

Shares of other chipmakers, including rival SK Hynix (000660.KS) and the world's biggest foundry TSMC (2330.TW), also rose as analysts said tight supply of certain chips could help offset slower demand that is driving down memory chip prices.

Samsung posted an operating profit of 14 trillion won ($10.7 billion), up 11% from 12.57 trillion won a year earlier, just shy of a 14.45 trillion won SmartEstimate from Refinitiv.

Revenue for the second quarter rose 21% to 77 trillion won, in line with market estimates.

The strong quarter for Samsung comes at a time when other chipmakers have warned of a looming chip glut at customers who stocked up during the pandemic to meet higher demand from people working from home.

Chipmakers including Micron (MU.O) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) have also recently signalled waning demand as red-hot inflation squeezes spending. read more

""Memory chipmakers are expected to build inventory this year, keeping supply conservative, and hike shipments when prices rebound and demand recovers next year"", said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment & Securities.

Prices of specific DRAM chips, used in devices and servers, fell about 12% last month from a year ago, according to data provider TrendForce. Prices of NAND Flash chips, used for data storage, are also projected to fall as much as 5% in the July-September period from the previous quarter.

SMARTPHONE DEMAND WEAKENS

Rising inflation, concerns about a downturn in major markets, the war in Ukraine and China's COVID-19 lockdowns have resulted in slowing smartphone sales, leaving server chip demand as the only bright spot, analysts said.

Samsung's profits have been shielded as large U.S. tech firms such as Amazon (AMZN.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google and Meta (META.O) that use a lot of data centre services kept buying chips to meet cloud demand, they added.

Making a case for strong server demand, Taiwanese contract electronics supplier and Apple iPhone maker Foxconn (2317.TW) on Monday raised its full-year outlook and said it was optimistic about the third quarter. read more

A strong dollar, which hit a 20-year high, may have also aided Samsung's chip profits in the second quarter. read more

Samsung's chip sales are made mainly in dollars, while it reports its profit in Korean won, so a firm greenback translates to higher chip earnings.

Estimated smartphone shipments by Samsung's mobile business in the second quarter were about 62-64 million, about 5%-8% lower than a March estimate, Counterpoint Research said, as inflation hit smartphone demand.

Samsung shipped 74 million smartphones in the first quarter.

""This trend is the same for major global smartphone makers, although there is variance to some degree ... In particular, the hit to the demand for low- and mid-end smartphones seems more severe,"" said Jene Park, Senior analyst at Counterpoint.

July 6 (Reuters) - Britain's antitrust watchdog said on Wednesday it had started an investigation into Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) $68.7 billion deal to buy ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O).

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had until Sept. 1 to make its phase 1 decision on whether the deal between the U.S. technology company and video-game maker Activision would reduce competition in the United Kingdom.

""We're committed to answering questions from regulators and ultimately believe a thorough review will help the deal close with broad confidence, and that it will be positive for competition,"" Lisa Tanzi, corporate vice president and general counsel of Microsoft told Reuters in an emailed statement.

""We expect and think it's appropriate for regulators to take a close look at this acquisition,"" Tanzi said.

Activision did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

216,667,Microsoft,2022-07-07,King Dollar stands tall as recession fears churn global markets,"













NEW YORK, July 7 (Reuters) - A cocktail of global growth fears, Federal Reserve hawkishness and euro weakness has boosted the U.S. dollar to its highest level in around 20 years, and some investors are betting there may be more gains ahead.

The dollar index , which measures the greenback against six major currencies, is up 12% against a basket of its peers in 2022 and is on track for its best year since 2014. The measure has logged a gain 7 out of the last 10 years.

Multiple factors are driving the dollar’s gains. Investors believe the Federal Reserve is likely to continue raising interest rates more aggressively than many other global central banks as it faces the worst U.S. inflation in decades, making the dollar more attractive to yield-seeking investors. read more

At the same time, some analysts worry that monetary tightening by the Fed and other central banks risks throwing the global economy into a recession. Other market participants are holding dollars because they believe the United States will weather a looming global downturn better than other countries. read more

The greenback has risen against every G10 peer, with the Japanese yen feeling the most pain as the Bank of Japan bucks the wave of monetary tightening among global central banks. read more

The stampede for dollars amid mounting global recession risks has combined with surging European gas prices to bring the euro to a two-decade low and close to parity with the greenback. read more

If the Fed is still hiking rates even as Europe and the United States slide into a recession, the euro could fall to as low as 0.95 against the dollar, down about 7% from its current level, wrote Deutsche Bank’s George Saravelos.

""We are not yet willing to go that far, but there has been a clear deterioration in the global and euro-specific growth outlook over the last two weeks which in our view justifies the dollar rally,"" he wrote.

Kit Juckes, head of FX strategy at Societe Generale, also believes the dollar may benefit in a global recession.

""The recession fear is global and unaffected by the U.S. data,"" he wrote in a note earlier this week. ""If the U.S. data are weak, we will expect European data to be equally weak.""

History shows that the dollar tends to rise in the months leading up to the first interest rate hike in hiking cycles, before easing following more rate hikes. read more

So far, however, the dollar has shown few signs of slowing down. The dollar index is up 8% since the Fed raised rates on March 16, its first hike since December 2018.

A strong dollar could help the Fed fight inflation by making imports cheaper. At the same time, it makes U.S. exporters’ products less competitive abroad while pressuring the bottom line of U.S. companies that need to convert their foreign profits into dollars.

In June, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) cut its fourth-quarter forecast for profit and revenue, joining a number of U.S. companies warning of a hit from the stronger greenback. read more

The dollar’s strength has been accompanied by a sharp rise in currency market volatility, as traders try to keep up with the rapidly changing global interest rate environment.

The Deutsche Bank Currency Volatility Index , which measures expectations for gyrations in FX markets, was last at 11.09, its highest since March 2020.

Meanwhile, this year, there have been 25 days when the dollar has risen by 0.5% or more, the most for any comparable period since 2015.

International Monetary Market speculators appear to expect further gains for the dollar, with net bullish bets on the U.S. dollar at $13.62 billion.

Speculators have maintained a bullish stance on the dollar for close to a year now, the longest such streak since March 2020, showed the latest data from U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

BRUSSELS, July 7 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are investigating the video licensing policy of the Alliance for Open Media (AOM), whose members include Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Meta , the European Commission said on Thursday.

The investigation is the latest to hit the tech industry, which will be subject to tough new rules in Europe next year that could force companies to change their core business models and do more to tackle illegal content on their platforms.

""The Commission confirms that it has a preliminary investigation ongoing into AOM's licensing policy,"" a spokesperson for the EU executive told Reuters.

""The fact that the Commission has a preliminary investigation does not prejudge the outcome of the investigation on the existence of an infringement,"" the spokesperson said, without providing further details.

AOM did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Founded in 2015, the group aims to create a new standard software for streaming higher-quality 4K video on browsers, devices, apps, and gaming, known as AV1.

While the AV1 software is not yet adopted widely, Netflix (NFLX.O) and YouTube have started using it for some customers, and browsers such as Google Chrome and Firefox have started to support the new format.

Apple and Google did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Meta and Amazon declined to comment. Microsoft (MSFT.O), Netflix, Broadcom (AVGO.O), Cisco (CSCO.O) and Tencent (0700.HK), who are also AOM members, did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.

Intel (INTC.O), Huawei (HWT.UL), Mozilla, Samsung (005930.KS) and Nvidia (NVDA.O) are also AOM members, according to its website.

In a questionnaire sent to some companies earlier this year and seen by Reuters, the EU watchdog said it was investigating alleged anti-competitive behaviour related to the license terms of AV1 by AOM and its members in Europe.

""The Commission has information that AOM and its members may be imposing licensing terms (mandatory royalty-free cross licensing) on innovators that were not a part of AOM at the time of the creation of the AV1 technical, but whose patents are deemed essential to (its) technical specifications,"" the paper said.

It said this action may be restricting the innovators' ability to compete with the AV1 technical specification, and also eliminate incentives for them to innovate.

The questionnaire also asked about the impact of an AOM patent license clause in which licensees would have their patent licenses terminated immediately if they launched patent lawsuits asserting that implementation infringes their claims.

Companies risk fines of up to 10% of their global turnover for breaching EU antitrust rules.

Summary Companies Treasury yield inversion stokes recession worries

Boeing jumps, deliveries reach highest monthly level in 3 years

Gap slides on CEO exit, outlook

Indexes fall: Dow 0.62%, S&P 0.92%, Nasdaq 0.95%















NEW YORK, July 12 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended in negative territory on Tuesday as growing signs of recession kept buyers out of the equities market ahead of inflation data.

While all three major U.S. stock indexes seesawed between modest gains and losses earlier in the session, they turned sharply lower late in the day as Wednesday's Consumer Prices report from the Labor Department drew near, with big bank earnings looming later in the week.

""(Investors are) waiting to hear what happens with CPI and earnings,"" said Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. ""For several months we've swung back and forth between inflation fears and recession fears, almost on a daily basis.""

""We have really confused investors who have chosen to go on a buyers strike,"" Schutte added. ""I don’t hear many people saying 'buy the dip.'""

While the CPI report is expected to show inflation gathered heat in June, the so-called ""core"" CPI, which strips away volatile food and energy prices, is seen offering further confirmation that inflation has peaked, which could potentially convince the Federal Reserve to ease on its policy tightening in autumn.

Paul Kim, chief executive officer at Simplify ETFs in New York, expects year-on-year topline CPI to ""be in the high eight or potentially even nine percentage range, and with inflation that high, the Fed has only one thing in mind.""

Worries that overly aggressive moves by the Fed to reign in decades-high inflation could push the economy over the brink of recession were exacerbated by the steepest inversion of the 2 year and 10 year Treasury yields since at least March 2010, a potential signal of near-term risk and economic contraction.

The market expects the central bank to raise the key Fed funds target rate by 75 basis points at the conclusion of its July policy meeting, which would mark its third consecutive interest rate hike.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 192.51 points, or 0.62%, to 30,981.33, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 35.63 points, or 0.92%, to 3,818.8 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 107.87 points, or 0.95%, to 11,264.73.

All 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 fell, with energy shares (.SPNY), weighed down by plunging crude prices , suffering the largest percentage loss.

The second-quarter reporting season will hit full stride later in the week as JPMorgan Chase & Co , Morgan Stanley , Citigroup and Wells Fargo & Co post results.

As of Friday, analysts saw aggregate annual S&P earnings growth of 5.7% for the April to June period, down from the 6.8% forecast at the beginning of the quarter, according to Refinitiv.

PepsiCo got the ball rolling this week by beating its quarterly earnings estimates and announced it could increase prices amid resilient demand. read more

Shares of Boeing Co jumped 7.4% after the plane maker's June aircraft deliveries hit the highest monthly level since March 2019. read more

That news, along with falling energy prices, helped the S&P 1500 Air Lines index (.SPCOMAIR) rise 6.1%.

Apparel retailer Gap Inc (GPS.N) fell 5.0% following its announcement that its CEO would step down, and that margins would stay under pressure in the second quarter due to input costs. read more

Software provider Service Now (NOW.N) plunged 12.7% after its CEO's remarks about macro headwinds and currency pressures. Other software companies, including Salesforce.com (CRM.N), Paycom Software (PAYC.N), Intuit (INTU.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), were also down.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.37-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.19-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and 30 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 13 new highs and 145 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.86 billion shares, compared with the 12.79 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

219,344,Microsoft,2022-07-12,Victoria's Secret cuts 160 management roles in reorganization,"













July 12 (Reuters) - Victoria's Secret & Co (VSCO.N) said on Tuesday it had cut about 160 management roles, or 5% of its home office staff, and hired a former Amazon executive as part of a reorganization following its separation from L Brands Inc last year.

The company also named executives to three key leadership roles reporting to Chief Executive Officer Martin Waters.

Amy Hauk, who has been heading the company's PINK brand since 2018, will take on the additional role of chief executive of the Victoria's Secret division, the company said.

The lingerie brand's Beauty business will be integrated into Hauk's organization, the company said in an emailed statement.

Greg Unis has been named chief growth officer after leading the Victoria's Secret and PINK Beauty businesses since 2016.

The company also appointed Christine Rupp as chief customer officer. She joins from Albertsons Cos Inc (ACI.N) and has previously worked at Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), where she led Fulfillment by Amazon and launched Amazon Prime Day, Victoria's Secret said.

The company said it expected to record a charge of about $30 million in the second quarter as part of the initiative, and estimated $40 million in cost reductions on an annualized basis from the third quarter.

Through Tuesday's close, Victoria Secret's shares have tumbled 34% since the start of trading in July 2021.

As part of the reorganization, L Brands changed its name to Bath & Body Works .

July 13 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) said on Wednesday it has selected Microsoft Corp as technology and sales partner for its planned ad-supported subscription offering, as the streaming giant looks to plug slowing subscriber growth by rolling out a cheaper plan.

Shares of Netflix rose 2% to $178.06 on the news.

Netflix said in April that it would introduce a new, lower-priced version of its service in a bid to attract more subscribers. The announcement came as the pioneering subscription service posted its first subscriber loss in more than a decade, and projected deeper losses to come.

Chief Operating Officer Greg Peters said in a blog post that Netflix chose Microsoft because of its ability to innovate, as well as for its strong privacy protections.

“It’s very early days and we have much to work through. But our long-term goal is clear. More choice for consumers and a premium, better-than-linear TV brand experience for advertisers,"" Peters said.

Microsoft is expected to power Netflix's ad sales.

The software giant brought in $10 billion in ad revenue last year, selling ads on various services such as its Bing search engine and its business-focused social network, LinkedIn. Last month, Microsoft completed its acquisition of AT&T Inc's online advertising platform, Xandr Inc., which allows advertisers to buy ad space across thousands of websites and target audiences.

Microsoft President Brad Smith has served on Netflix's board since 2015.

The partnership announcement comes ahead of Netflix’s second-quarter earnings report on Tuesday. The company cautioned investors it could lose as many as 2 million subscribers in the period, despite the return of such popular series as “Stranger Things,” which broke viewer records.

Netflix joins a number of its rivals in offering ad-supported service, including Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) Hulu, NBCUniversal’s Peacock and Warner Brothers Discovery’s HBO Max.

Disney also plans to introduce a version of Disney+ with commercials.

Researcher Comscore Inc said such ad-supported services are seeing a faster rate of adoption than subscription services, as inflation pinches consumers' wallets.

“The time is ripe for traditionally subscription-based streaming services like Netflix to consider launching an ad-supported tier to enhance their growth trajectory,” Comscore's James Muldrow said in a statement.

223,233,Microsoft,2022-07-14,"Google's cloud unit taps Arm-based chips, adding to Intel, AMD pressure","













July 13 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google Cloud unit on Wednesday said it will start adopting computing chips based on technology from Arm Ltd, making it the latest company to join a transition that will take market share from Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O).

Arm, the British chip firm that has said it plans to go public after a megadeal to be acquired by Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) fell through earlier this year, has long supplied designs and other intellectual property that power chips for smart phones and tablets. In 2018, Arm started offering technology for chips used in data centers, a market dominated by Intel and AMD.

In the four years since, Arm's technology, which it licenses to other companies to weave into complete chips, has showed up in data centers around the world, including those at Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp and Oracle Corp in the United States and Alibaba (9988.HK), Baidu (9888.HK) and Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) in China.

Those firms buy huge volumes of computing chips and then rent out the computing power to software developers via their paid cloud computing services. They all still offer services based on chips from Intel and AMD. But with Google joining the ranks of cloud providers offering Arm-based chips, nearly every major provider now has at least a few offerings based on Arm.

Some of the cloud computing firms such as Amazon and Alibaba are designing their own Arm-based chips and having them manufactured by chip factories. Several others - including Google - are turning to Ampere Computing, a chip firm founded by former Intel executives that has filed confidential paperwork with U.S. securities regulators for an initial public offering.

Google said on Wednesday its new offering will be based on Ampere's ""Altra"" chips. Ampere is also selling chips to Microsoft and Oracle, among others.

224,703,Microsoft,2022-07-15,Can business travel get into a more sustainable flight-path post-Covid?,"Summary Corporate travellers in Europe comprise about 12% of customers but are responsible for 30% of emissions

Study ranking 230 of the world’s largest companies found 193 were failing to act with sufficient speed and ambition to tackle travel emissions

A quarter of travel predicted to be replaced by video conferencing in 2022, while drone use can replace site visits

Green Stay Initiative aims to plug data gap on travel stays, scoring hotels on sustainability factors















July 14 - As the travel sector seeks to recover from the pandemic, business travel will be crucial to the sector’s fortunes. But when it comes to sustainability, business travel is a big part of the problem.

Flying is the key issue, mainly because there are currently so few sustainable alternatives to traditional jet fuel, and none is expected until after 2030. Just 1% of people cause half of all aviation emissions, according to European non-governmental organisation (NGO) Transport & Environment, and many of these trips are business-related.

In Europe, corporate travellers comprise about 12% of customers but are responsible for 30% of emissions, says Denise Auclair, corporate travel campaign manager at Transport & Environment, which launched a campaign in May with several other European NGOs and U.S. NGO Stand.earth, urging companies to reduce corporate travel emissions by 50% compared with 2019 levels.

In a study ranking 230 of the world’s largest companies, the NGOs found that 193 were failing to act with sufficient speed and ambition to tackle corporate travel emissions, despite the fact that in some sectors they are the biggest part of companies’ carbon footprints. Only eight companies, Novo Nordisk, Swiss Re, Legal & General, Fidelity International, Zurich Insurance, Lloyds Banking Group, Ernest & Young and Credit Agricole, were awarded top scores of As, while 22% were given Ds for either failing to disclose their business travel emissions or having no specific targets to reduce business travel.

Before global lockdowns shut down all movement, business travel was booming. According to McKinsey, in 2019 it was a $1.4 trillion market, with the United States and China comprising nearly half of that, and was growing at 5% a year, faster than global GDP. The impacts of COVID-19 led to a 52% drop in business travel, although McKinsey forecasts a full recovery by 2024.

Yet even before the pandemic, there were signs that some companies where starting to think about the climate impact of business travel, as the Scandinavian concept of Flygskam (flight shame) was becoming more widespread.

The past few years has also seen the emergence of science-based targets, the net-zero movement and the broadening of corporate emissions reduction targets from companies’ own direct emissions to Scope 3 emissions in their value chain.

Auclair of Transport & Environment, says the pandemic showed that, thanks to video conferencing and other digital technologies, companies can function perfectly well without business travel. “Businesses had to find different ways of doing business and keeping in touch,” she said.

A Morgan Stanley survey suggested that about a quarter of travel would be replaced by video conferencing in 2022, and a fifth in 2023.

It is not just meetings that can be done remotely, Auclair points out. “If you need to know what’s going on in a factory, you can use virtual reality technology and it’s almost as if you’re there. And there is an increasing use of drones to do site visits and inspections, particularly for remote and hazardous sites.”

One of the most carbon-effective moves is to travel by train rather than flying. Eurostar says that flights emit up to 13 times more than the equivalent rail journey.

Many trips in places such as Europe, Japan and China, where geography and good rail networks exist, are being replaced by rail. Indeed, France’s parliament voted in 2021 to ban flights where there is a rail alternative of 2.5 hours or less. Such moves are obviously less feasible in markets such as Australia and parts of North America.

Kathryn Read, international sales and marketing consultant at financial consultancy Aon, says: “I’m seeing many companies rethinking whether it’s really worth driving three to four hours for that 60- to 90-minute meeting. If meetings need to be done in person, staff are requested to bundle meetings on that day so that they travel for, say, three to four meetings, not just the one.

""Wherever possible public transport should be used, and all efforts should be made to avoid domestic flights.”

Gavin Geminder, national managing principal of growth and strategy at KPMG U.S. says KPMG uses its internal carbon price to encourage employees to think twice about flying.

We are charging a carbon fee proportional to the emissions of each airline ticket booked, which is then allocated to the business group responsible for the travel emissions. The fee is designed to fund green investments that decarbonise our operations,” said Geminder.

He added that KPMH had updated its events and meetings policy to reduce travel for internal meetings. “While business travel remains important today, it should be reserved for the in-person moments that matter.”

Nevertheless, there is a big gap between ambition and action on cutting CO2 emissions in business travel, according to the Global Business Travel Association. A survey of 762 members and 100 external stakeholders, including policymakers and NGOs, earlier this year found that while tackling climate change is now the top priority for 88% of the business travel sector, only 14% think the industry is currently well advanced on sustainability. Barriers cited included higher costs, limited data, and lack of access to transparent information. Even where rail travel is a feasible alternative to air travel, for example, it is significantly more expensive.

There was a big divergence between what business customers were demanding and what the industry was supplying, with 73% of buyers encouraging or mandating taking fewer trips, and 60% of suppliers not encouraging such reductions in travel. Europeans are much more likely to support the encouragement of less travel and six times more likely than North Americans to support mandating multimodal travel options.

In an effort to plug the data gap, travel management group HRS launched the Green Stay Initiative 15 months ago. The initiative, which now has hotels in 72 countries in the scheme, scores hotels on factors such as carbon, water and waste, providing advice on how hotels can become greener, and giving companies carbon footprint data so they can manage their business travel emissions.

The scoring scheme, which uses methodology from the Hotel Carbon Measurement Initiative, incorporates all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from activities within a hotel, including restaurants, meeting spaces, spas and gyms, to give a carbon footprint per occupied room.

Jason Long, senior vice president for global business development, says this could be as little as 5kg per occupied room for an eco-hotel to as much as 125kg per occupied room for a hotel with a spa and golf course.

Dina Belon is vice-president of operations and real estate for StayPineapple, a boutique group with 10 urban hotels across the United States that is a member of the Green Stay Initiative.

“For corporate travellers, sustainability is important, particularly large corporates,” she says. “We are part of their supply chain. They have to report on those emissions, and they want data on that.”

Courtney Kelso is executive vice president and general manager of global commercial cards at American Express, which introduced a carbon footprint dashboard for corporate clients in 2019. “We know our corporate clients are increasingly looking for solutions to better understand their impact when it comes to carbon emissions around employees’ travel,"" she says.

Last year, American Express announced a goal to pilot low-carbon product innovations for its customers as part of its Advancing Climate Solutions initiatives and its own 2035 net-zero goal. It is also launching an offset referral suite to allow companies to manage their footprint via offset solutions, including investments in large-scale carbon removal, reduction projects and avoidance projects. Currently available only to U.S. clients, Amex hopes to expand the service to other markets in future.

Auclair at Transport & Environment points out that laggards in its business travel survey include companies that have signed up to some of the ambitious climate targets, such as Microsoft, IBM, Google and Accenture.

However, many of these same companies are part of the 60-member World Economic Forum's Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition, which is working to increase the uptake of sustainable aviation fuel as the most viable solution to decarbonising the aviation industry in the short term.

In June 2021, the coalition launched a sustainable aviation fuel certificate framework, a “book and claim” system where companies seeking to offset their corporate flights can purchase certificates that will cover SAF’s price premium even though it may not be available at their departure airport. It will instead be fed into another aircraft in an airport where it is available.

Microsoft, for example, has bought certificates from Alaska Airlines and SAF producer SkyNRG to cover employee travel between Seattle and three Californian airports. It is also purchasing certificates in another pilot project announced last September with Air BP and United Airlines to supply 26,500 litres of waste-based SAF at British airports.

In June, Shell, Accenture and American Express launched Avelia, a blockchain-powered SAF book and claim system, offering an initial 1 million gallons of SAF for companies to offset their business travel, enough to power 15,000 individual business traveller flights from London to New York. The SAF will be blended 50% with kerosene. Shell said it intends to cover 45% of its corporate travel emissions through SAF by 2030.

But Auclair at Transport & Environment said investing in SAF shouldn't be a substitute for making efforts to fly less. ""Between flying less and SAFs, it's not either/or but both/and. We need to stop making aviation's climate problem worse, and at the same time find alternatives to burning fossil fuels on planes.""

225,534,Microsoft,2022-07-15,"TomTom sticks with revenue and cashflow guidance, giving shares a boost","













July 15 (Reuters) - Dutch digital mapping group TomTom (TOM2.AS) on Friday confirmed its revenue and cashflow guidance for 2022 and 2023, boosting its shares, after reporting a bigger-than-expected second-quarter loss, citing high inflation and strained supply chains.

The confirmation of TomTom's guidance helped to drive the company's shares up more than 12%, putting them on course for their strongest day in almost four years. The shares have lost a fifth of their value this year.

ING analyst Marc Hesselink said: ""OK results despite challenging circumstances"" and he also highlighted the confirmation of guidance as reassuring.

The company, whose clients range from Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Renault (RENA.PA) to (UBER.N) and Microsoft , has been hit by the global chip shortage that has disrupted the automotive and electronics industries and forced automakers to slash production.

""We are not sure the chip shortage will get better this year, there is no evidence to support that yet"", Chief Executive Officer Harold Goddijn told Reuters, pointing to predictions indicating the shortage will continue in the first half of 2023.

TomTom also pointed to uncertainties related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and increasing inflation.

""These could impact supply chains, cost levels, general macro-economic activity as well as the valuation of our assets and liabilities on the balance sheet,"" the company said in a statement.

TomTom, which in June initiated restructuring of its maps business, said the plan had impacted its operating expenses by 31 million euros in the quarter. read more

Cash outflows related to restructuring are expected to be weighted towards the second half of the year, with roughly one third of the total costs expected in 2023, it said.

""We expect the first effects of the restructuring to come through in Q3 of this year, and of course benefits will be visible in Q4 2022, or maybe in Q1 2023"", Goddijn told Reuters.

He said around 20 TomTom sites across the world were affected by the reorganisation, mostly in Europe, and that the group was still in talks with trade unions.

The Amsterdam-based company, whose products are used by major carmakers and leading global tech firms, posted a quarterly operating loss of 55.5 million euros ($55.7 million), against analysts' average forecast for a loss of 20 million euros.

226,750,Microsoft,2022-07-15,"Analysis: As dollar roars higher, few dare to stand in its way","













NEW YORK, July 15 (Reuters) - An epic rally in the dollar has investors wondering how much further it can run, though many are biding their time before turning bearish on the U.S. currency.

The dollar is up about 13% this year to a two-decade high against a basket of peers and is on pace for its best year since 1997, lifted by a hawkish Federal Reserve and investors seeking a haven from global economic uncertainty.

Its steady climb has rippled through markets, helping push the euro to its lowest level in more than two decades and weighing on the earnings of U.S. corporations such as Microsoft and BlackRock (BLK.N). read more

The extent of the dollar's strength has taken markets by surprise.

A model used by BoFA Global Research comparing macroeconomic fundamentals in different economies, for example, last month showed the dollar was overvalued against the currency of every G10 country. Moreover, history shows that while the greenback tends to strengthen before a Fed hiking cycle, it begins to fall soon after, a pattern it has so far deviated from. read more

Still, the dollar’s momentum has made investors hesitant to stand in its way.

""Almost any currency looks attractive compared to the dollar on a longer-term basis, but investors have to ask themselves ... what happens if you put on a position and the dollar keeps on strengthening?"" said Brian Rose, senior economist at UBS Global Wealth Management.

Though recession worries have flared in the U.S. as the Fed tightens monetary policy, the outlook for many other economies appears even gloomier, increasing the dollar’s allure. A potential energy crunch in the euro zone, for example, has investors doubting the European Central Bank can raise rates far without hurting growth. read more

""One cannot have a weak USD (dollar) without a strong EUR (euro), and right now, the latter is in the midst of a structural shift that will be incredibly painful,"" analysts at TD Securities wrote. They believe the euro could fall as low as $0.85, after breaching $1.00 this week for the first time in 20 years.

Meanwhile, the Fed has raised interest rates faster than expected in an effort to tame inflation, putting yields in the U.S. higher than those in many developed countries. Higher rates make the dollar more attractive to investors.

That gap may narrow as other central banks accelerate their own monetary policy tightening. The Bank of Canada raised rates by 100 basis points on Wednesday -- though this week’s blistering U.S. inflation reading has bolstered expectations for a similar move from the Fed.

At the same time, positioning in rate futures markets shows investors expect policymakers to raise rates swiftly this year before easing in early 2023, as growth slows. read more

""The moment the U.S. economy runs into some kind of growth problem, the U.S. dollar is going to turn,"" said Thanos Bardas, senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, who has reduced his dollar bets but remains bullish on the currency.

The median forecast in a Reuters poll earlier this month showed analysts expect the dollar to fall 8% against the euro over the next year. Most also see it strengthening in the next three months, however. read more

""If you close your eyes for 12 months, the dollar will probably have depreciated by the time you open them, but there will likely be significant volatility in the meantime,"" said Francesca Fornasari, head of currency solutions at Insight Investment, a UK-based asset manager, with about 817.1 billion pounds ($968.51 billion) in assets under management as of March 31.

Investor positioning shows the dollar likely has room to run, Fornasari said. Net bullish futures bets on the dollar stood at $18.20 billion in the latest week, compared with a $35 billion peak in 2019, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed.

Dollar bears are not completely extinct.

Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, is underweight the dollar, betting that the near-20% drop U.S. stocks have experienced this year will weigh on the economy and increase the likelihood of the Fed ending its tightening cycle earlier.

""As equities continue to weaken, that is a big tightening of financial conditions. That is going to hurt the U.S. consumer,"" he said.

Others, however, believe little can stop the dollar from strengthening until there’s evidence that the Fed’s policy tightening is peaking.

""The USD remains king of FX and it will be incredibly brave and naive to assume otherwise,"" wrote TD’s analysts.

July 15 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) plans to raise the monthly subscription fee for its sports streaming platform ESPN+ by $3 a month, a 43% hike, the company said on Friday.

The price of an ESPN+ subscription will rise to $9.99 per month starting Aug. 23, while the cost of an annual subscription will go up to $99.99 from $69.99. Subscribers will be officially notified next week.

However, the fee for those getting a bundle of all of Disney's streaming services, including Hulu and Disney+, will not get impacted, the company said.

Shares of Disney rose nearly 4% in afternoon trading.

Over the last year and half, Disney said it has added expanded National Football League (NFL) rights, expanded its rights to Wimbledon and the Australian Open, renewed rights for the popular FA Cup and more on ESPN+.

Media companies have been searching for new ways to generate more revenue amid reduced ad spending and strong competition in the congested streaming market, with Disney betting on a strong comeback from live-sports streaming from a pandemic-led lull.

Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), on the other hand, has teamed up with Microsoft Corp for its planned ad-supported subscription offering, as it looks to plug slowing subscriber growth by rolling out a cheaper plan. read more

Summary Law firms

Law firms Related documents Legal fee settlement closes 2019 lawsuit over cannabis policy documents at U.S.-Canada border

In U.S. records cases, fees above $100,000 are rare















(Reuters) - The U.S. government has agreed to pay $150,000 in legal fees to Davis Wright Tremaine in a settlement closing a federal public records lawsuit that the law firm filed to obtain cannabis policy information for the U.S.-Canada border.

Reuters obtained a copy of the settlement from Davis Wright after U.S. District Judge Ricardo Martinez in the Western District of Washington last week issued an order closing the case at the parties' request.

The Seattle-based law firm in March 2019 sued U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for policy records concerning entry bans on foreign nationals at the U.S.-Canada border who were involved with Canada's legal cannabis businesses.

The law firm said it sued for records ""to protect our clients from over-aggressive and potentially unlawful enforcement actions, and appropriately advise them on crossing the U.S.-Canada border.""

CBP produced records after three years of litigation including what the law firm described as an internal U.S. government information guide concerning ""Legalization of Marijuana in Canada.""

Davis Wright attorney Caesar Kalinowski said he hoped the outcome would ""deter CBP and other agencies from refusing to respond in the future.""

A spokesperson for the Seattle U.S. attorney's office declined to comment on the case.

Legal fees in federal public records cases more routinely are below $100,000, according to Justice Department data showing fees and costs in decisions last year in U.S. public records lawsuits.

Of the about 50 orders involving fees last year, only three were above $100,000. Fees between $5,000 and $25,000 were more common.

Davis Wright reached a settlement over its fees, but in some cases hourly rates are contested and judges are called on to weigh the reasonableness of a law firm's demand.

In one case last year, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington, D.C., awarded law firm Ballard Spahr about $122,000 in a records lawsuit brought on behalf of The Washington Post.

The firm had sought more than $154,000 in fees in the case. The lawsuit successfully sought data from U.S. regulators about the pandemic-era relief measure Paycheck Protection Program.

The case is Davis Wright Tremaine v. U.S. Customs & Border Protection, U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, No. 2:19-cv-334.

For plaintiff: Bruce Johnson and Caesar Kalinowski of Davis Wright Tremaine

229,75,Microsoft,2022-07-18,Microsoft president sees 'new era' of stagnating labor pool,"[1/2] Microsoft President Brad Smith speaks during a Reuters Newsmaker event in New York, U.S., September 13, 2019. REUTERS/Gary He















REDMOND, Wash., July 18 (Reuters) - U.S. companies are facing a ""new era"" in which fewer people are entering the workforce and pressure to pay higher salaries may become permanent, Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) President Brad Smith told Reuters in an interview.

At the software maker's Redmond, Washington, headquarters, Smith highlighted one source of what he called today's ""greater economic turbulence."" In his office, he walked over to a wall-sized touchscreen device and pulled up a series of charts, showing how population growth has tumbled in the United States, Europe, China and Japan.

The trend of around 5 million people expanding the U.S. working age population every five years since 1950 has shifted, starting in the period between 2016 and 2020 when growth slowed to 2 million, and is now slowing further, said Smith late last week, citing United Nations data. Major markets overseas have seen outright labor force declines.

""That helps explain part of why you can have low growth and a labor shortage at the height at the same time. There just aren't as many people entering the workforce,"" said Smith, who helps oversee the nearly $2 trillion company selling cloud-computing services to major businesses.

Government stimulus during the pandemic, COVID-19 concerns, childcare and other factors have contributed to the current labor shortage as well.

Executives including Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), have recently fretted about the economy. Zuckerberg warned the United States might face ""one of the worst downturns that we've seen in recent history,"" though Smith said it would be premature to declare a recession inevitable. read more

Competing for limited workers, Microsoft recently boosted pay at the same time as it slowed hiring, company officials said. The software maker also trimmed a small percentage of jobs pegged to the start of its new fiscal year.

Smith said Microsoft's business selling productivity tools, cloud services and technology with artificial intelligence, which enterprises may need in a downturn, sets it up to weather economic challenges. The company has recently faced antitrust scrutiny in Europe, and Smith said Microsoft had until October to ""finalize the implementation"" of changes he promised. read more

U.S. Department of Labor data from June showed employers broadly had continued to raise wages and hire more workers than expected. Labor force participation, however, shrank for the second time in three months, to 62.2%, showing no persistent improvement since the start of 2022. read more

Population growth has become a hot topic in the tech industry. Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk, who reportedly has nine children including newborn twins, has particularly drawn attention to the low U.S. birth rate. ""Doing my best to help the underpopulation crisis,"" he wrote on Twitter.

Smith said he concurred with Musk ""maybe in the problem. I'm not recommending the same solution.""

230,451,Microsoft,2022-07-18,"IBM beats quarterly revenue estimates, warns of $3.5 bln forex hit","













July 18 (Reuters) - IT hardware and services company IBM Corp (IBM.N) beat quarterly revenue expectations on Monday but warned the hit from forex for the year could be about $3.5 billion due to a strong dollar.

A hawkish Federal Reserve and heightened geopolitical tensions have driven gains in the dollar against a basket of currencies over the last year, prompting companies with sizeable international operations, including Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Salesforce (CRM.N), to temper expectations.

Shares of IBM pared losses and were down 1.3% in extended trading.

On the earnings call, Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh told analysts both currency headwinds and impact from exiting Russia operations has put pressure on IBM's near-term results but reiterated the company's full-year forecast of hitting the upper end of mid-single-digit revenue growth at constant currency.

IBM expects a foreign exchange hit to revenue of about 6% this year, Kavanaugh said. It had previously forecast a 3%-4% hit.

Second-quarter revenue was hurt by $900 million due to a stronger U.S. dollar, Kavanaugh said, adding the pace and magnitude at which the currency has strengthened was ""unprecedented"".

IBM posted adjusted gross profit margin of 54.5% for the quarter ended June 30, while analysts on average expected 56.6%, according to Refinitiv data.

However, strong demand at its consulting and infrastructure businesses helped IBM post second-quarter revenue of $15.54 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $15.18 billion.

IBM sees revenue growth continuing, including in regions like Europe and Asia Pacific, despite geopolitical turmoil and inflationary pressures, Kavanaugh said, echoing words of peer Accenture , which had last month said it does not foresee a pull back in client spending. read more

The 110-years-old company has placed its hopes on high-growth software and consulting businesses with a focus on the so-called ""hybrid cloud"". Cloud revenue rose 18% to $5.9 billion.

Excluding items, the company earned $2.31 per share, beating estimates of $2.27.

231,13,Microsoft,2022-07-19,Microsoft launches 'sovereign' cloud for governments,"













STOCKHOLM, July 19 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) on Tuesday launched a public cloud for government customers, offering greater control over their data, and has signed up Italian defence group Leonardo (LDOF.MI) and Belgian telecoms firm Proximus (PROX.BR) as partners.

The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked a digital transformation in many public sector organisations, and Microsoft expects to use its ""Cloud for Sovereignty"" to better compete with rivals such as Amazon (AMZN.O) Web Services and Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O). read more

The size of the global government cloud market is expected to reach $71.2 billion by 2027 from $27.6 billion in 2021, according to market research firm Imarc Group.

""We do expect customers around the world ... but the first few customers have been in Europe,"" corporate vice president Corey Sanders said in an interview, adding that the company is conducting private previews with customers.

The European Union has been at the forefront of privacy and security legislation and its privacy watchdog launched a probe earlier this year into the public sector's use of cloud-based services to check if they comply with its privacy safeguards.

Both business and government customers increasingly use the data centres of big tech companies in the form of public clouds rather than building their own infrastructure.

Apart from latest tech capabilities and lower cost, Microsoft said its cloud product would fulfil obligations around data governance, security controls, privacy of citizens, data residency and other legal requirements.

The company is also working with other local partners to provide tailor-made clouds for local governments.

232,702,Microsoft,2022-07-19,Netflix soothes Wall Street concerns with customer growth forecast,"













LOS ANGELES, July 19 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) on Tuesday averted its own worst-case scenario of subscriber losses, posting a nearly 1 million drop from April through June, and predicted it would return to customer growth during the third quarter.

Shares, which have fallen roughly 67% this year on concerns about the company's long-term prospects, rose 8% in after-hours trading following the results. Investors took the forecast as a signal that Netflix could still find new subscribers despite a rocky global economy and signs of saturation in its biggest market, the United States and Canada.

The world's largest streaming service said it plans to launch its ad-supported option next year. It also warned that the strong dollar was hitting revenue booked from subscribers abroad.

The company had said in April it expected to lose 2 million customers in the second quarter, shocking Wall Street and raising concerns that the streaming TV boom had come to an abrupt end. read more The losses came in at about half that, at 970,000.

""Our excitement is tempered,"" Chief Executive Reed Hastings said in a post-earnings interview posted on YouTube, given that Netflix still lost subscribers. ""But looking forward, streaming is working everywhere. ... We're very bullish on streaming.""

Hastings credited new episodes of the science-fiction series ""Stranger Things,"" the most-watched English-language show in Netflix history, with helping to stave off more defections.

Netflix forecast customer additions for July through September to hit 1 million, while Wall Street analysts on average were expecting a forecast of 1.84 million, according to analysts polled by Refinitiv.

""The stock is up because (analyst) downgrades all made a big deal out of slowing growth,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said, noting that Netflix was cutting costs and expected free cash flow to grow substantially next year.

Shares of other streaming companies rose slightly after the Netflix report. Roku Inc (ROKU.O) stock gained 2.7% while Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Paramount Global (PARA.O) were each up about 1%.

After years of red-hot growth, Netflix's fortunes changed as rivals including Disney, Warner Bros Discovery and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) invested heavily in their own streaming services.

Netflix lost 1.3 million customers in the United States and Canada in the second quarter, and 770,000 in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. That was offset by a gain of nearly 1.1 million members in the Asia/Pacific region.

In a letter to shareholders on Tuesday, Netflix said it had further examined the recent slowdown, which it attributed to a variety of factors including password-sharing, competition and a sluggish economy.

""Our challenge and opportunity is to accelerate our revenue and membership growth by continuing to improve our product, content and marketing as we’ve done for the last 25 years, and to better monetize our big audience,"" the letter said.

One way the company plans to earn more from members is by limiting password-sharing. The company is testing two options in Latin America.

It also is working to build on the popularity of ""Stranger Things"" and seeking to turn some of its biggest successes into franchises. read more

Netflix remains the dominant streaming service with nearly 221 million global paid subscribers. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said the company still sees room for ""enormous"" growth by attracting many of the billions of people worldwide who have yet to sign up.

""We have some headwinds right now, and we're navigating through them,"" Sarandos said.

For April through June, earnings per share came in at $3.20, ahead of the Wall Street consensus of $2.94.

Netflix said the strong U.S. dollar hit revenue, which grew 9% to $7.97 billion, below analyst estimates of $8.04 billion. Revenue would have increased by 13% without the foreign exchange impact, the company said.

Last week, Netflix announced Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) as its technology and sales partner for the ad-supported offering. read more

July 19 (Reuters) - Quality assurance workers at Blizzard Albany, a unit of games developer Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O), on Tuesday announced the formation of a union and have filed for union representation with the labor board, a statement from the workers said.

234,539,Microsoft,2022-07-19,J&J's cancer drug sales help weather hit from stronger dollar,"













July 19 (Reuters) - (This July 19 story corrects paragraph three to say company reported Q2, not Q1, results)

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) on Tuesday reported quarterly results that beat analysts' estimates on strong demand for cancer drug Darzalex and its COVID-19 vaccine, even as the company cut its full-year adjusted profit forecast due to a stronger dollar.

J&J joins other major U.S. multinationals with sizeable international operations, including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and IBM , in warning that a stronger dollar would hurt overseas sales.

But J&J's shares rose 1% in morning trading as its strong second-quarter profit helped allay some investor concerns around the impact of the strong dollar, which has been driven by a hawkish Federal Reserve and heightened geopolitical tensions.

Strength across Johnson & Johnson's pharmaceuticals unit, its largest, helped it soften a blow to sales of its medical devices from lockdowns in China, and the impact of inflation and supply shortages at its consumer health unit.

The company said it was raising prices of some products like painkillers and mouthwash in response to inflation.

""We do know that while folks are looking to generally cut back spending, that's been in entertainment, dining out,"" said Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk.

But ""when it comes healthcare, better health, looking better, products like Aveeno, Neutrogena, Tylenol, Listerine, they seem to do really well, and consumers will prioritize those.""

Sales of cancer drug Darzalex of $1.99 billion beat estimates of $1.84 billion.

The company's COVID-19 vaccine, which has seen slow demand due to safety concerns and productions hurdles, brought in sales of $544 million, versus estimates of $138 million. The company which suspended its sales outlook on the vaccine in May - said it was modifying the shot's manufacturing capacity amid a glut of vaccine supply.

It did not disclose specifics but said the changes would result in additional costs that would be reported as a one-time charge. J&J said it still expects to meet its contractual supply commitments.

Total sales of $24.02 billion, with nearly half of the sales coming from outside the United States, beating estimates of $23.80 billion.

On an adjusted basis, the company earned $2.59 per share, beating estimates of $2.54 per share.

J&J now expects full-year adjusted profit of $10.00 to $10.10 per share, compared with its prior forecast of $10.15 to $10.35.

July 20 (Reuters) - Lyft Inc (LYFT.O) said on Wednesday it was cutting about 60 jobs in its rental division as it tries to reorganize the business amid rising costs.

With inflation in the United States at levels not seen in four decades, a number of companies such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) have halted hiring and expansion plans in anticipation of a recession.

Lyft will discontinue a service line where it offered its cars for long-term rentals. Instead, the San Francisco, California-based company will offer rental cars through its partnerships with Sixt SE and The Hertz Corp, it said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

The Wall Street Journal first reported about the layoffs at Lyft. (https://on.wsj.com/3aQRH86)

July 20 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended higher on Wednesday with the tech-heavy Nasdaq booking a 1.6 % gain on positive earnings signals with a wary eye on inflation and more interest rate hikes by the Fed.

Netflix Inc's (NFLX.O) shares added 7.4% after the company predicted it would return to customer growth during the third quarter, while posting a smaller-than-expected 1 million drop in subscribers in the second quarter. read more

Other high-growth stocks extended gains following the forecast from the streaming service provider. Shares of Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) rose between 1% and 4.2%.

Electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) rose 2% in extended trading after reporting a rise in quarterly profit after the bell. read more

“Equity prices are trending in a roller coaster fashion, currently being at the mercy of inflation, interest rates and earnings,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.

“We're going to need another series of reporting cycles to confirm whether or not inflation indeed is getting under control.”

Analysts expect aggregate year-on-year S&P 500 profit to grow 5.9% in this reporting season, down from the 6.8% estimate at the start of the quarter, according to Refinitiv data.

Runaway inflation initially led markets to price in a full 100-basis-point hike in interest rates at the Fed's upcoming meeting next week, until some policymakers signaled a 75-basis-point increase.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.51 billion shares, compared with the 11.43 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

""Low volumes accentuate market moves historically and even though we've wiped off $10 or $15 trillion from global equities this year, there's still a lot of excess liquidity. So low volume on excess liquidity can still accentuate moves,"" John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management, said.

237,818,Microsoft,2022-07-21,Ambition of 'guilt-free' travel through offsets faces rocky road,"Summary Emissions-intensive tourism industry is responsible for 8% of global CO2 emissions

‘Wild west’ of voluntary offsets market a barrier to reducing environmental impact of industry

Voluntary market exceeded $1bn in 2021, covering almost 300 million tonnes of CO2















July 20 - Book a flight with an airline these days and you may have the option to offset your share of the carbon dioxide emissions from that journey. It may be a route to guilt-free flying, but is it a route to emissions reduction?

Tourism is an emissions-intensive industry – responsible for around 8% of global carbon dioxide emissions. Since last November’s COP26 climate summit in Scotland, more than 500 companies have signed up to the Glasgow Declaration on Climate Action in Tourism, which commits them to decarbonise tourist operations and restore and protect ecosystems.

What could be more attractive then, than mitigating the impact of travel while contributing to nature or local communities? In theory, each offset represents an amount of carbon dioxide that has either been removed from the atmosphere (for example, by trees) or avoided by providing, for instance, clean cookstoves, which also improve indoor air quality and reduce local deforestation. Avoiding or reducing emissions elsewhere doesn’t, however, tackle the CO2 that is entering the atmosphere as a result of the activity you’re offsetting.

Criticisms of the voluntary offsetting market are well-rehearsed. Issues centre on whether they provide carbon removals that are in addition to what would have happened anyway, and crucially, are permanent. This was dramatically illustrated last summer, when wildfires tore through forest projects on the U.S. west coast that had generated offsets bought by the likes of BP and Microsoft.

A report in May from investment bankers Credit Suisse, described the voluntary market as the “wild west” with “poor transparency” and “low (if any) correlation between price and credit quality”.

Environmental campaigners also fear offsetting allows companies to delay the deep emissions cuts needed to avoid catastrophic warming. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which defines best practice in line with climate science, only allows companies to use offsets to go beyond their science-based or net-zero target.

Adventure travel company Explore Worldwide has just been through the detailed process of trying to measure emissions from all its trips, as well as the office, to start the process of cutting emissions by 50% by 2030. The numbers will get refined as methodologies improve, but it’s given the company a starting point, says sustainability specialist Hannah Methven. “It’s got the whole team looking at trips and asking; ‘is this the best routing (or) can I use a different vehicle here?’”

Offsetting is included in the cost of each trip (excluding the flights customers booked themselves – a challenge Methven is wrestling with) but she sees it as “the bottom of the rung”. Reduction “has to be our biggest priority. And then we look to mitigate, to support initiatives that are trying to help nature and biodiversity and use (those) to draw down carbon.”

These include projects with Rewilding Britain, and Cool Earth (which works to stop rainforest deforestation). For offsetting “we look for projects that are focused on preventing emissions in the first place and supporting renewable energies.”

Explore is sourcing its offsets through Climate Impact Partners. Mark Griffiths, managing director for Europe, insists his firm rigorously assesses potential projects to validate carbon-removals claims and make sure there are back-up plans in the event of forest fires, for example. It’s also investing in artificial intelligence and satellite technologies to provide ongoing monitoring. “It's our reputation that we are risking if we are promoting something that is not delivering according to its claim.”

Explore’s website states that the cost of offsetting is less than £10 per person, though that will inevitably change as increasing demand is pushing up the price of offsets, says Methven.

Griffiths estimates offset projects such as clean cookstoves cost between $6 and $15 a tonne of CO2 avoided; mangrove or peatland restoration costs up to $30 a tonne, while renewable energy projects may attract less than $10 a tonne.

That’s a big contrast to the price of carbon on compliance markets such as the European Union’s emissions trading system (EU ETS), which has been as high as 96 euros ($102) a tonne this year.

And it certainly doesn’t reflect the social cost of carbon, which is defined as the economic impact of emitting a tonne of carbon. The U.S. government uses a figure of $51, while a recent economic analysis that took temperature-related mortality into account suggested it should be over $250 a tonne.

Last year, Forest Trends’ Ecosystem Marketplace initiative reported that the voluntary market exceeded $1 billion for the first time, covering almost 300 million tonnes of CO2. Forestry and land credits dominated, followed by renewable energy credits.

Now, demand is outstripping supply, particularly for “quality” projects. The reason, says Griffiths, is that companies are beginning to understand what their exposure would be were they to be taxed on carbon.

So, for those hard-to-abate emissions, they’re now willing to pay more. And they will have to. A new focus for carbon markets is so-called blue carbon. A major project in Colombia to restore coastal mangrove forests has already seen the price of credits triple to $30-$40, according to the Colombian President, Iván Duque Márquez, who recently told the World Economic Forum in Davos that he expected credits sold in the next couple of years to fetch more than $100 per tonne.

Whether travellers will be prepared to pay more, however, remains to be seen.

According to Credit Suisse’s analysis, airlines were some of the biggest users of offsets, due to preparations for the industry’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) scheme, which aspires to make sure any growth in aviation emissions are offset elsewhere.

There’s huge variation between different airlines and footprint calculators as to how much carbon dioxide is emitted on a journey. A quick check for a return flight from London to New York reveals anything from 0.7 tonnes to 2.7 tonnes per person, and offsetting charges varying from $7 to $70 for an economy flight. How much of that reaches projects on the ground is unclear.

In the past few years, airlines including BA and Lufthansa have been giving customers the option of offsetting their flights more directly by contributing to their efforts to decarbonise by blending sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) into kerosene, which can be three times as expensive as fossil fuel. From 2025 the EU, through its ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, will mandate aviation fuel suppliers to include (initially) 2% SAF in aviation fuel at EU airports.

Carbon dioxide is still emitted when the fuel burns. There are also concerns about the sustainability of using vegetable oils in SAF. But if CO2 is captured from the air or industrial processes and combined with renewable hydrogen to make a synthetic or e-fuel, greenhouse gas emissions can be cut by as much as 85%, according to European campaign group Transport & Environment.

Lufthansa and BA make it clear that SAF isn’t being added to specific individual flights, as it can only be supplied at certain hubs, but Reinout Debergh, aviation policy analyst at Transport & Environment, says customers will want to know how sustainable the fuel choices are, and whether their own flight uses SAF or whether it is fuelling another.

“What guarantees (are there) that the customer’s money will actually be used for purchasing SAFs? Who will track that money and who will verify it? How do we know that airlines won’t double-price customers by passing through the costs of regulations, such as ReFuelEU, into ticket prices and additionally asking the customer to pay for SAFs?” asks Debergh.

And although neat SAF may boast carbon savings of up to 85%, in real use its mitigation potential is far lower, as it is only being offered today in blends with kerosene of 10-50%.

That question of transparency is an issue for the whole offsetting industry. Climate Impact says its offsets are endorsed by Gold Standard, a leading standard-setting initiative.

But there’s no one official international standard – something that the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative (VCMI) is working to remedy. The multi-stakeholder VCMI has produced a draft Claims Code of Practice, and has just begun road-testing it with some corporates.

Principles for offsetting developed in 2020 by a team at the UK's University of Oxford urged businesses to shift to removal offsets, where carbon is scrubbed from the atmosphere and locked away. This, too, will have to shift from efforts such as tree-planting, to long-lived storage, such as geological storage.

This nascent market is being encouraged by companies with deep pockets, including Stripe, Meta and Google’s parent Alphabet, who have signed up to a new platform called Frontier, which has committed to spend $925 million over the next eight years on technologies to remove carbon. (Read more)

In the meantime, Griffiths at Climate Impact Partners argues that the finance going into communities through offsetting schemes such as cookstoves, provides valuable employment, empowers women and delivers benefits to health and biodiversity along the way.

So perhaps, as Carbon Market Watch has argued, rather than claiming to compensate for emissions, companies could simply make a claim to contribute to climate action that also brings tangible benefits to people and environment.

Microsoft Teams/Handout via REUTERS















July 21 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) MS Teams was back up for most users, the company said on Thursday, after an hours-long outage that disrupted the chat application for tens of thousands of customers globally.

The company cited a disruption on a recent software update that ""contained a broken connection to an internal storage service"".

""We're addressing any residual impact related to this event. Additionally, we are monitoring for any signs of failure until we're confident that all functions of the service are fully recovered,"" the company said on its website.

MS Teams, used by more than 270 million people globally, forms an integral part of daily operations for businesses and schools, which use the service to make calls, schedule meetings and organize their workflow.

The company did not disclose the number of users affected by the disruption, but outage tracking website Downdetector.com showed more than 4,800 incidents in the United States and over 18,200 in Japan. The site tracks outages by collating status reports from sources including user-submitted errors on its platform.

During the outage, most users were unable to exchange messages or use any features of the application. Many users took to Twitter to share updates and memes about the service disruption, with #MicrosoftTeams trending as a hashtag on the social media site.

""Microsoft Teams has stopped, and half the working world along with it #MicrosoftTeams,"" a Twitter user said.

Microsoft also confirmed some downstream impacts to multiple Microsoft 365 services with Teams integration, such as Microsoft Word, Office Online and SharePoint Online.

The company has benefited from a surge in demand for remote business teleconferencing and messaging tools, with MS Teams becoming a key fixture for organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic as people worked from homes.

Other big technology companies have also been hit by outages in the past year, with a near six-hour disruption at Meta Platforms (META.O)that kept WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger out of reach for billions of users last October. read more

241,406,Microsoft,2022-07-22,Wall Street Week Ahead: Strong dollar looms over U.S. earnings season,"













NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - Companies reporting earnings in coming weeks are likely to mention one common factor gouging their results: the strong dollar.

The U.S. currency stands near a 20-year high against a basket of its peers

A strong dollar can be a headwind for U.S. companies as it makes exporters’ products less competitive abroad and hurts multinationals that need to convert their foreign profits back into the U.S. currency.

Each percentage point of year-on-year increase in the U.S. Dollar Index , which measures the dollar against six other currencies, translates to a 0.5 percentage point hit to S&P 500 earnings growth, analysts at MorganStanley estimated.

""You seemingly can't get a break right now. We're starting to get some relief from oil prices, but you've still got the dollar banging on you,"" said Bill Stone, chief investment officer at the Glenview Trust Company.

International Business Machines Corp , Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) were among the companies that in the past week cited the dollar’s strength as a headwind, with Johnson & Johnson joining Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) by cutting its guidance due to the impact of the greenback’s rise.

Next week’s results from Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and a slew of other companies will give investors a better picture of how businesses are holding up in the face of the strong dollar and soaring inflation.

Investors are also awaiting what the Fed will have to say on those topics at its monetary policy meeting next week, at which it is widely expected to deliver another jumbo-sized 75 basis-point rate increase. read more

DOLLAR DOLDRUMS

Overall, some 40% of S&P 500 revenues come from overseas, data from FactSet showed. Information technology leads all sectors with 58% of revenues derived internationally, followed by materials with 56%, while utilities companies source just 2% of their revenues out of the United States, according to FactSet.

The dollar’s strength threatens to combine with high inflation, supply chain issues and other factors to weigh on earnings, analysts said.

“The rate of change on the dollar exhibits a strong negative correlation over time vs. S&P 500 earnings revisions. USD strength comes at an inopportune time for corporates already facing margin pressure and increasingly weaker demand,” Morgan Stanley’s analysts wrote.

So far, 5.1% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported their second quarter results have posted earnings above expectations, nearly half the average of 9.5% over the prior four quarters, according to Refintiv data.

Few can say when the dollar will turn, as the inflation-fighting Fed is expected to raise interest rates more aggressively than other central banks, boosting the U.S. currency’s appeal to yield-seeking investors.

Still, some are betting that signs of a peak in the dollar’s rally could balance out some of the damage caused by the burgeoning greenback.

Dollar peaks over the past 40 years have been followed by rallies in the S&P 500, with the benchmark index climbing by an average of 10% in the next 12 months on increased risk appetite and expectations of improving earnings, wrote John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management.

Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group, said the dollar is trading at a nearly 120% “safe-haven premium” based on its historical relationship to the consumer sentiment index.

The dollar has declined by an average 4.5% over 12 months each time its premium rose over 20% since 1988, he added.

Others are looking at the bright side of dollar strength, which some see reflects the belief that the United States can weather a looming global slowdown better than other countries.

Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, has been increasing his overweight in U.S. equities, betting that any the effects of a strong dollar will be outweighed by better economic growth over the long run.

""We think investors get too focused on the dollar's impact on earnings,"" he said.

242,404,Microsoft,2022-07-22,Take Five: It's a Fed hot summer,"













July 22 - A likely second straight 75 basis point rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve will keep markets on their toes in the week ahead, just as investors digest a wave of earnings from corporate America and Europe.

The prospect of early elections in Italy after the collapse of the government means there's plenty of political drama too, and Australia's latest inflation numbers may add to pressure on the country's central bank to get ahead of the curve.

Here's your week ahead in markets from Ira Iosebashvili in New York, Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, and Sujata Rao, Dhara Ranasinghe and Vincent Flasseur in London.

1/ FED HOT

Fed officials have poured cold water over expectations for a 100 basis point rate hike in July but Wednesday's meeting will still have drama aplenty. read more

A 75 bps interest rate hike is priced in, and coming on top of 150 bps worth of tightening so far in this cycle, that is sure to bite consumers and businesses. read more

Investors will be looking at whether the Fed thinks inflation is peaking and how it views the U.S. economy, as they try to gauge the scope of a September rate move.

Hanging in the balance are nascent rallies in U.S. stocks and bonds. The S&P 500 is up almost 10% from its mid-June low (.SPX), 10-year Treasury yields are down 60 bps .

2/ EARNINGS: PART I

Earnings from Google-parent Alphabet, Microsoft, Coca Cola, Apple and others will show how well corporate America is coping with soaring inflation and a strong dollar.

This year's 17% decline in the S&P 500 has lowered the index's forward price-to-earnings ratio to around 17.3 from 21.7 at the start of 2022, closer to the market's historic average of 15.5, according to Refinitiv Datastream. read more

While there have been several notable beats this season, it's early days and many worry that earnings estimates may not hold up in the face of the highest inflation in four decades and tightening financial conditions. read more

Also clouding the picture is the burgeoning dollar, which makes U.S. exports less competitive and hurts firms earning much of their money abroad. Alphabet, Microsoft and Coca Cola report on July 26, Apple and Amazon on July 28. read more

3/ EARNINGS: PART II

One-sixth of Europe's STOXX 600 equity index reports second-quarter results July 25-29, and Refinitiv I/B/E/S forecasts earnings to have grown 22% year-on-year.

That headline figure masks disparities; earnings growth at energy firms basking in the glow of $100-a-barrel oil is seen at 185%, while real estate businesses will show a 70% drop, Refinitiv predicts.

Statements from retailers, heavy industry and hospitality firms may show how much pain is being inflicted by energy shortages and high inflation. The likes of Airbus, Volkswagen and Mercedes will cast light on the state of European exporters.

Bank earnings, expected to have slowed around 16%, include numbers from UBS, Credit Suisse, Deutsche, Barclays and BNP Paribas.

The Q2 season will show if European shares are correctly valued around 11.5 times forward earnings, versus their 14% long-term average, or need to cheapen further.

4/ MAMMA MIA

A political crisis couldn't come at a worse moment for Italy. The ECB has just jacked up rates for the first time since 2011, inflation is soaring and the country has been hit hard by its exposure to Russian gas read more .

The collapse of Mario Draghi's government ends months of stability, unnerving markets that had cheered when the ex-ECB chief became prime minister in 2021. They now worry about the prospect of new elections and Rome's ability to pass policies.

It also leaves the ECB, with its new tool to contain stress in bond markets, in an awkward position of determining which part of government bond spread widening is ""unwarranted"" - or giving up buying Italy's bonds altogether. read more

5/ CREDIBILITY ISSUE

Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) boss Philip Lowe is pledging a steady policy-tightening campaign to at least double interest rates from current levels to ""chart a credible path"" back to the RBA's 2-3% inflation target. read more

Quarterly inflation numbers due Wednesday could show a further acceleration in price growth, which at 5.1% is already at its highest in two decades.

The rate-rise pledges are ironic coming from Lowe, who just months ago pushed back against markets, saying he didn't see rates rising throughout 2022, but has since lifted them three times since May. read more

Criticism of the RBA's inflation policy has led to an independent inquiry of its operations.

NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 see-sawed on Monday and ended close to unchanged as investors girded for an expected rate hike at a Federal Reserve meeting this week and earnings from several large-cap growth companies.

The Nasdaq ended lower, and S&P 500 technology (.SPLRCT) and consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) led declines among major S&P sectors. The energy sector (.SPNY) gained along with oil prices.

Summary Companies Dollar falls ahead of Fed meeting

Germany on cusp of recession, Ifo says

Fed expected to hike rates 75 bps on Wednesday















NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters) - The dollar was lower against a basket of major currencies on Monday, as investors weighed the implications of a rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve in an economy that may be on the verge of a recession.

The central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates by 75 basis points at the conclusion of its policy meeting on Wednesday. A hike of that magnitude would effectively close out pandemic-era support for the economy. read more

Expectations for a hike of 75 basis points from the Fed stand at about 75%, according to CME's Fedwatch Tool, with a 25% chance of a 100 basis point hike.

Recent data has shown signs of an economic slowdown while inflation remains stubbornly high, with claims for jobless benefits rising to its highest in eight months last week and regional manufacturing gauges slumping. read more

Later in the week, investors will also eye the advance reading for second-quarter gross domestic product, which could show negative growth and meet a traditional definition of recession. On Friday, personal consumption expenditures, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, will be released.

""Everybody is expecting a 75 percent increase, a recession essentially the day after with a negative GDP so I don’t think you are going to get anything changing right now,"" said Joseph Trevisani, senior analyst at FXStreet.com.

""But right now, equities are going nowhere, the dollar has remained strong but has given back, the traders who went long the dollar took some profits which is perfectly normal.""

The dollar index fell 0.244% at 106.420, with the euro up 0.14% to $1.0224.

Last week, the greenback saw its biggest weekly percentage decline in two months, as a rally in equities helped dent the appeal of the safe-haven dollar and a 50 basis point rate hike by the European Central Bank helped buoy the euro to a two-week high.

On Monday, Latvian central bank Governor Martins Kazaks said in an interview with Bloomberg News that the ECB may not be done with big rate hikes. read more

U.S. equities gave up early gains with a slew of corporate earnings on deck for the week, including those from mega-cap names such as Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft <>MSFT.O> and Amazon <>AMZN.O>. Investors are eyeing the earnings season for signs of a slowdown in the economy as well as the impact of a strong dollar on profits.

Of the 107 companies in the S&P 500 (.SPX) that have reported earnings through Monday morning, 74.8% have topped analyst expectations, below the 81% beat rate over the past four quarters, but above the 66% rate since 1994, per Refinitiv data. Earnings growth is currently estimated to be 6.1%, up from 5.6% at the start of July.

245,160,Microsoft,2022-07-25,Tech investors may be overvaluing moats,"













NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Technology investing is mostly about carving out a business that can’t be copied and reaping monopoly-style margins. Investors seem to think Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Apple (AAPL.O) have done this, but they may be overvaluing the moats.

Over the past year, Meta Platforms (META.O) and Netflix (NFLX.O) valuations have been pounded as competition in advertising and video streaming has caused investors to reassess growth prospects. Meta’s stock, for example, has lost half its value since the start of 2022 as tech giants Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Apple are expanding fast in advertising. The rise of TikTok makes the walls surrounding ad-dependent social networks in particular look flimsy read more . Similarly, the growth of streaming services from Apple, Walt Disney (DIS.N) and others have slowed subscriber growth at Netflix to a crawl and pressured margins.

Investors have fewer worries when it comes to Microsoft and Apple. With Apple’s first quarter market share of North American mobile phone shipments exceeding 50%, according to Canalys, it is increasingly inconceivable to think that users will ditch their iPhones. And it’s credible to think the $2.5 trillion company’s Chief Executive Tim Cook will have success selling more advertising and financial services to its customers. It’s even harder to imagine companies abandoning their workplace software, run by Microsoft, which, for example, holds 85% of the market share in U.S. public sector productivity software, according to Omdia.

And yet valuation multiples reflect these relative expectations, and then some. The stock price of Meta has corrected so much, its enterprise value is now worth less than 4 times estimated revenue for the next 12 months. Five years ago, that metric was 9 times, according to Datastream. Netflix has an enterprise value of 3 times estimated revenue for the next 12 months, half its valuation five years ago. Meantime, Apple, at 6 times, is twice its valuation from five years ago. Likewise, Microsoft’s multiple has risen 60% to over 8 times.

The buffers for the latter two companies are assailable. Rivals still want to steal customers, antitrust regulators can’t be dismissed entirely, and the biggest threat – these firms miss out on a market shift as tech advances – remains. While moats protect against rivals, they may do little against a recessionary wave that smashes earnings in the sector overall. Technology investors may be right on their assessment, but wrong on the way they are valuing it.

REUTERS/Nacho Doce/File Photo















SAO PAULO, July 25 (Reuters) - Brazilian police allege an Italian refiner purchased gold from a trader sourcing it illegally in the Amazon rainforest region, according to police documents, and corporate disclosures show that refiner has supplied the precious metal to four of the world's largest tech companies.

Public filings by Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) name the private Italian firm Chimet as a source of some gold used in their products. Tech companies often use small amounts of the metal in circuit boards for consumer electronics.

According to police documents obtained by investigative journalism outfit Reporter Brasil and reviewed by Reuters, Brazilian federal police have accused Chimet of buying millions of dollars in gold from trader CHM do Brasil, which allegedly acquired the precious metal illegally from wildcat miners.

CHM do Brasil, responding to questions via a lawyer, said all its gold was legally acquired with proper documentation.

Illegal mining has surged in Brazil since right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro took office in 2019, advocating for wildcatters and seeking to legalize mining on indigenous land.

Unregulated mines have destroyed rainforest land in the Amazon while polluting rivers with deadly mercury. Miners have clashed violently with indigenous tribes protecting their land, leaving a trail of death, disease and intimidation. read more

Brazilian sustainability think tank Instituto Escolhas estimated that the country produced 84 tonnes of illegal gold in Bolsonaro's first two years in office, up 23% from the two years before and equivalent to nearly half of Brazil's total gold output.

""A company that is buying gold from Brazil already knows there is a huge risk it is buying irregular gold - Amazon blood gold,"" said Larissa Rodrigues, an author of the Escolhas report.

A Chimet representative said the company cut off relations with CHM upon learning of the allegations in October 2021, when police conducted raids in nine Brazilian states and the federal district targeting CHM and others allegedly involved in the illegal gold trade.

A police document summarizing the investigation dated August 2021 states that Chimet allegedly bought 2.1 billion reais ($385 million) worth of gold from CHM between 2015 and 2020.

A federal police spokesperson in Para state declined to comment on the investigation because it is ongoing and remains under seal. Indictments will likely be announced when the probe concludes later this year, he said.

Federal prosecutors would then have to decide whether to press charges, he added.

The four U.S. tech firms listed Chimet among more than 100 gold refiners in their supply chains during the investigation's five-year timeframe and in the most recent 2021 disclosures.

Chimet does not have a direct relationship with the four tech majors but sells gold to banks that can resell it for a variety of uses, company representative Giovanni Prelazzi said in a statement to Reuters. He did not name the banks.

Apple did not specifically address Chimet but said in a statement that its policies prohibit use of illegally mined minerals. Companies that cannot comply are removed from its supply chain, the iPhone maker said.

Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft declined to comment.

Chimet said that, after learning of the CHM investigation in Brazil, it contracted accounting firm Deloitte to conduct an audit of its other suppliers and in April 2022 it was again certified by bullion market association LBMA as meeting responsible gold sourcing standards.

An LBMA representative told Reuters that Chimet's actions showed similar problems did not exist with other suppliers and that verification methods were being strengthened.

NOT REGISTERED

The police documents allege that CHM was not registered with Brazil's central bank as an entity legally authorized to buy and sell gold, known as DTVMs.

CHM does not appear in the central bank's online directory of registered DTVMs. It is illegal for anyone other than miners and their associations to buy and sell gold in Brazil without such a registration.

CHM said it did not buy gold as a financial instrument and that registration is not required to buy gold as a commodity.

The central bank said it did not regulate ""operations with gold classified as a commodity.""

A 2020 analysis of relevant laws by federal prosecutors found that such registration is required for anyone other than miners to buy and sell gold, regardless of its usage.

Financial records of bank transfers show CHM bought gold from both the cooperative and directly from several individuals in the southern part of Para state, which forms part of the Brazilian Amazon.

The cooperative COOPEROURI has a permit to mine in an area next to the protected Kayapo indigenous reserve, but police found both CHM and the coop bought from independent miners without permits, according to the investigation documents.

COOPEROURI could not be reached for comment.

The police report said the cooperative and individual miners are believed to be extracting ore illegally in the indigenous reserve, although did not state the basis for that allegation.

In the police report, satellite images of the Kayapo reserve - a region larger than Belgium - show vast swathes of muddy mining pools and clandestine airstrips to access them.

Fed in focus with two-day policy meeting on Tuesday















NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters) - Nasdaq (.IXIC) closed lower on Monday after a choppy session for U.S. equities ahead of a big week of technology earnings reports while oil prices rose and treasury yields edged higher as investors braced for a Federal Reserve interest rate hike.

In currencies, the dollar index, which touched a 20-year high this month, was down slightly and gold also slipped. read more

On Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that while U.S. economic growth was slowing, a recession was not inevitable. read more

Treasury yields edged higher as investors braced for the Fed to raise rates by an expected 75 basis points this week. Some are worried about the potential for recession.

Investors were also positioning ahead of earnings in big companies such as Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O), as well as second-quarter GDP data.

""Right now we're just in a holding pattern waiting for all those developments to play out,"" said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut.

""People are probably just taking some risk off ahead of the earnings. We've seen interest rates rise a little too so that's helping some of the value names like banks.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 90.75 points, or 0.28%, to 31,990.04, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 5.21 points, or 0.13%, to 3,966.84 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 51.45 points, or 0.43%, to 11,782.67. read more

The gap between yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes US2US10=RR, a possible signal of a looming recession when the short-end yield is higher than the long end, has been inverted for more than two weeks and was last at -21.5 basis points.

""This is the first meaningful yield curve inversion we've had since 2006 for any period of time,"" said David Petrosinelli, senior trader at InspereX, adding that this fed into a generally accepted narrative of a slowdown at the very least.

Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 8/32 in price to yield 2.8105%, from 2.781% late on Friday while the 2-year note price last fell 2/32 to yield 3.0266%, down from 2.991% in the previous session.

The dollar index fell 0.253%, with the euro up 0.13% to $1.0223.

The Japanese yen weakened 0.45% versus the greenback at 136.66 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.2053, up 0.42% on the day.

""Pre-Fed caution is keeping the dollar off its highs. The market is going to be eager to see if the run of softer data has in any way changed the Fed’s hawkish rate path,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington, DC.

""The economy continues to show pretty solid underlying momentum but at the same time, high inflation, rising interest rates, they are certainly having an impact on the economy.""

Oil prices rose on Monday, bolstered by a slightly weaker U.S. dollar while investors seesawed between supply fears and bets rising U.S. interest rates could weaken demand.

U.S. crude settled up 2.11% at $96.70 per barrel and Brent finished at $105.15, up 1.9% on the day.

248,621,Microsoft,2022-07-25,Amazon to raise Prime prices in Europe as retailer wrestles with costs,"













NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will raise fees for its delivery and streaming service Prime in Europe by up to 43% a year, the online retailer said on Monday, as it moves to counter higher costs days before it reports quarterly financial results.

The price hike, following one that Amazon announced for Prime in the United States in February, reflects mounting pressure from Wall Street on new Chief Executive Andy Jassy to shore up profit as inflation rises and a downturn looms.

Shoppers in Germany, Amazon's second-biggest market after the United States, will see fees for an annual Prime membership rise 30% to 89.90 euros ($91.88). The retailer's No. 3 market, the United Kingdom, will have a 20% increase to 95 pounds ($114.47) per year, while Amazon sites covering Spain, Italy and France will charge Prime members between 39% and 43% more yearly.

The changes take effect starting Sept. 15 when members join or next renew.

Amazon cited ""increased inflation and operating costs"" as well as faster delivery and more content to stream in statements on the price rises, the first since 2018 for some of the countries. ""We will keep working to ensure Prime offers exceptional value for members,"" it said.

In April, Amazon posted its first quarterly loss in seven years from headwinds including higher wages, rising gas costs and an unrealized loss from its stake in Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN.O).

In the just-ended June quarter, the value of that investment declined another $4 billion. Ford Motor Co (F.N), also a Rivian investor, recently sold some of its shares.

Amazon said it remains committed to working with Rivian, ""an important partner"" helping it put thousands of electric delivery vans on the road in the United States in 2022.

The logo of Amazon is seen at the company's logistics center in Bretigny-sur-Orge, near Paris, France, December 7, 2021. REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes/File Photo

Analysts on average expect net income of $1.38 billion when Amazon reports results on Thursday, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. This week, Walmart Inc (WMT.N) warned its 2022 profit would fall more than anticipated as higher fuel and food prices led consumers to ease discretionary spending. read more

Amazon, after record operating profits from at-home shopping in the pandemic, is now on a cost-cutting program. It has not backfilled roles in some warehouses, paused building a major office space in Bellevue, Washington and slowed warehouse openings while letting leases lapse.

It has increased prices for some merchants selling on its platform, too. In May, Amazon imposed an average 4.3% fuel and inflation surcharge on sellers storing and shipping their products in major European markets, following a similar move in the United States.

Analysts are concerned a downturn could slow a major profit engine for the company, its cloud division Amazon Web Services (AWS).

""AWS revenue is more exposed than (cloud rival Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O)) given a greater portion of the clients are in the startup space, which is under pressure,"" Bernstein Research said in a recent note.

How much the Prime hikes will offset costs was unclear. Months into the U.S. increase, the percentage of shoppers who were Prime members for a year had grown, Colin Sebastian of Baird Equity Research said after Amazon's Prime Day event.

While the July Marketing blitz was ""not a blow out,"" he said, ""there is less churn than feared from higher membership costs.""

249,794,Microsoft,2022-07-26,Google search ads beat targets despite global 'uncertainty',"













July 26 (Reuters) - Google search ads lifted parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) close to Wall Street sales expectations on Tuesday, sending shares up on relief that the world's biggest seller of online advertising may withstand a global recession better than smaller rivals.

A trio of Alphabet executives sounded caution on a call with investment analysts, using ""uncertain"" or ""uncertainty"" at least 13 times to describe the economy. YouTube ad sales grew at their slowest pace since disclosures began in 2018.

But investors focused elsewhere, notably on the fact that second-quarter sales from the company's biggest moneymaker - Google search - actually topped expectations. Shares of Alphabet jumped 5.5% in after-hours trading following the results.

""Despite the underwhelming quarter, expectations were so low that investors blew a sigh of relief,"" said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.

By contrast, shares of Snap Inc (SNAP.N) fell more than 25% last week after the company missed sales expectations and warned of an ad market slowdown. read more

Alphabet executives said Google was not immune to the pullback, which has been brought on by clients facing product shortages, less demand and a variety of other factors. Rising wages as well as rising prices of fuel and other items also have forced some ad buyers this year to pare marketing.

But Google has weathered storms better than social media companies. It brings in revenue through a greater variety of functions in the ad market, and search ads can be less expensive for customers to generate since they often include just text.

Clients sometimes prioritize search ads because the marketing is typically directed at people actively searching for related items, yielding better returns.

Travel and retail advertisers drove an increase of nearly 14% in search ad sales for Google during the second quarter, which at $40.69 billion beat FactSet estimates of $40.15 billion.

Overall, Alphabet reported second-quarter revenue of $69.69 billion, 81% coming from Google's ad business, and nearly in line with the average expectation of $69.88 billion among investment researchers tracked by Refinitiv.

""Google is relatively well positioned to weather the rough waters that lie ahead,"" Insider Intelligence analyst Evelyn Mitchell said.

SALES THREATS

Many factors have motivated concerns about Alphabet's outlook. Big U.S. multinationals including Alphabet are increasingly bringing in less cash when converting foreign revenue because of the strong dollar.

Alphabet said that sales would have been close to $72 billion if not for currency swings. About 55% of the company's sales come from outside the United States.

The currency impact will be even greater in the third quarter, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said.

Amid scrutiny from antitrust regulators on five continents, Google is taking a smaller cut from sales of apps developed by outside software makers. Users also spent less on apps in the second quarter, Porat said.

Other hits have come from Google suspending sales in Russia due to the war in Ukraine, and YouTube's ad revenue fluctuating as its options for advertisers grow and wane in popularity.

Sales from Google Cloud of $6.3 billion missed analysts' target of $6.4 billion and YouTube ads also fell short, coming in at $7.3 billion against estimates of $7.5 billion, according to FactSet data.

Earlier this month, Google lost out on a major new sales partner when Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) said it had chosen Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) ad technology to help with its first foray into placing ads on its streaming video service. read more

With investors accustomed to gross profit margins as high as 60%, Google, like many of its peers, recently began slowing hiring in some units to better manage expenses.

But at the same time, Alphabet is moving forward with expanding its cloud computing footprint, building out new offices and bringing its Google Fiber internet service to new communities.

Alphabet's second-quarter profit fell to $16 billion, or $1.21 per share, compared with the average estimate of $1.29 per share. Alphabet's profit tends to be unpredictable due to sporadic gains or losses - at least on paper - in the stakes it holds in many startups.

Alphabet shares had fallen over 27% so far this year heading in to the quarterly results, more than the overall S&P 500 index (.SPX). Alphabet split its stock 20-for-1 on July 15, briefly boosting shares before disappointing results from Snap and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) sent them falling.

Meta Platforms Inc , which through Facebook and Instagram owns the second-biggest online advertising service, reports earnings on Wednesday. Its shares rose nearly 3% on Tuesday after Alphabet's results.

But softer consumer demand hit video gaming revenue at Xbox maker Microsoft (MSFT.O), which posted a 7% drop in Xbox-related revenue and expects a further contraction this quarter. Microchip maker Texas Instruments (TXN.O) saw weaker demand from consumers for personal electronics.

BUYING, BUT FOR HOW LONG?

Consumer giants Coca Cola Co (KO.N), McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) and Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) all said on Tuesday that their products are still selling, even at higher prices.

Unilever, which has 400 brands including Hellmann's mayonnaise, Knorr stock cubes and Domestos bleach, raised its full-year sales guidance after beating first-half underlying sales forecasts as it hiked prices. read more

So far consumers are buying, but there is a question around how long that can last.

""We see price increases when we go out to do a weekly shop. The question is: how much more accepting can the consumer be on those price increases?"" said Ashish Sinha, portfolio manager at Unilever and Reckitt (RKT.L) shareholder Gabelli.

McDonald's which operates nearly 40,000 restaurants, said its global same-store sales jumped almost 10%, much better than the expectation for an increase of 6.5%. read more

Even so, the Chicago-based company said it is considering whether to add more discounted menu options because soaring inflation, particularly in Europe, is leading some lower-income consumers to ""trade-down"" to cheaper items and to buy fewer big combination meals, Chief Financial Officer Kevin Ozan said.

Coke's global sales volumes rose 8% in the second quarter, the company said, powered by growth in both developed and emerging markets, while average selling prices increased about 12%. read more

""Coke's results are testament to its brand value because consumers are unwilling to trade down to other colas, despite increasing prices,"" CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson said.

SLOWDOWN AHEAD?

Germany-based footwear maker Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE) cut its earnings target for the year due to a slow recovery for its business in China. read more

General Motors Co (GM.N) on Tuesday reaffirmed its full-year profit outlook on an expected surge in demand and said it was curbing spending and hiring ahead of a potential economic slowdown, but a 40% drop in its quarterly net income disappointed, sending shares lower. read more

The Detroit automaker's reduced net income reflected supply-chain snarls, including a global semiconductor chip shortage that hit hardest in June. The company's shares fell 3.4%.

Nevertheless, GM sees a lot of pent-up demand.

Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said GM still sees strong pricing and demand for its vehicles.

A GM pickup truck starts around $31,500 for a base Chevrolet model, while a loaded GMC Sierra can top $100,000. Most models come in the $50,000 to $70,000 range.

""We feel good about making up all that (lost) volume in the back half of the year,"" he said.

251,259,Microsoft,2022-07-26,"Google’s ""victim of success"" status is worth it","













WASHINGTON, July 26 (Reuters Breakingviews) - For Google, it’s not so bad to be the successful one. The technology giant’s search business is resilient even in the face of economic wobbles that are hurting rivals. That’s partly due to the monopolistic characteristics of its business that make the $1.4 trillion parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) more vulnerable in U.S. antitrust cases against it. But its valuation, and Microsoft’s (MSFT.O) history, show that it will be fine.

Google benefits because of the way it dominates the different facets of the online ad marketplace, running auctions that determine which and how promotions will be shown. On Tuesday, parent Alphabet said that revenue rose 13% in the second quarter, led by a jump in advertising related to its search business. Its cloud business helped too, notching up 36% to $6.3 billion.

A surge in travel, among other activities, has helped and contrasts with Snap (SNAP.N) and Twitter (TWTR.N), which last week missed analyst estimates with disappointing revenue from digital marketing. Still, the success could prompt more attention from the U.S. Justice Department, which sued Google in 2020 for alleged anti-competitive behavior in search and is preparing another lawsuit related to its online marketing business.

The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Alphabet offered to spin off that unit to preempt the government’s legal action. In theory, separating those businesses means that they won’t be sharing information, which could chip away at Google’s dominance.

But companies have weathered this sort of scrutiny before. In 1998, the DOJ accused Microsoft of monopolistic practices by bundling the Internet Explorer browser with its operating system. After several years of litigation, the company agreed to share its program interfaces with third parties as part of a settlement.

Microsoft’s stock meandered between roughly $20 to $30 a share from 2002 to 2013. By 2015, though, it started to get out of its slump, and shares rose fivefold to around $250 a share on Tuesday.

That suggests early innovators that cull market share can have longevity, even if they hit some bumps. Plus Alphabet’s multiple gives it a cushion. Its enterprise value is roughly five times historical sales, a slight discount to where it was in 2017. That’s higher than technology rivals that depend on less dependable brand advertising, like Meta Platforms (META.O), but half the multiple of Microsoft read more . Google may be a victim of its own success, but the success will outlast the victimhood.

NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - Results from the four largest U.S. companies by market value highlight a busy week of corporate earnings and could help determine whether the stock market can sustain its recent rally.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) are set to report after the market closes on Tuesday, with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) due on Thursday, in a week that will see reports from about 170 companies representing some 47% of the S&P 500's market value, according to Credit Suisse.

Those four companies, which have helped power gains for the benchmark S&P 500 for the past decade, account for nearly one-fifth of the weigh in the index.

What they forecast is ""pretty representative of how the economy is doing,"" said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco. ""If Microsoft comes in and says things are ok, if Google says things are ok, then that represents a significant weight in not just market cap but the overall economy.""

The heart of the second-quarter earnings period is overlapping with Wednesday's decision from the Federal Reserve on interest rates. The central bank is expected to hike by 75 basis points as it seeks to fight the worst inflation in 40 years. read more

With inflation surging and rate hikes weighing on risk sentiment this year, the S&P 500 is down about 17% in 2022, but has rebounded 7% since its closing low for the year in June.

""This week could be very critical to whether we can continue to recover or whether this is just some kind of bear market rally on the way back down towards lows,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at family investment office Cherry Lane Investments.

The S&P 500 was down 0.6% early Tuesday after retailer Walmart (WMT.N) slashed its profit forecast as rising prices for food and fuel prompted customers to cut back on discretionary purchases. read more

Investors' expectations for second-quarter results were downbeat heading into the period, given concerns about a potential recession as well as inflation raising costs for businesses and consumers.

With 107 S&P 500 companies reported so far, about 75% have posted earnings above analysts' expectations, according to Refinitiv IBES data as of Monday. However, that trails the 81% beat rate for the past four quarters.

Earnings are expected to have climbed 6.1% for the second quarter from the year-ago period, according to Refinitiv. Tech sector earnings are projected to rise 2.4%.

The four megacap companies plus Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O) -- which reports on Wednesday -- are projected in aggregate to increase revenues by 6.7% but see earnings fall by 14.4%, according to Credit Suisse strategists.

When Alphabet and Meta report, focus will be on advertising spending after Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Snapchat's owner Snap Inc (SNAP.N) last week signaled advertisers had tightened their purse strings in response to a darkening economic outlook. read more

Investors will be keen for insight on consumer demand from Apple, maker of iPhones and MacBooks, and online retail giant Amazon.

Microsoft has already warned of financial headwinds from currency effects from the strong dollar, a factor that is expected to loom over an array of companies this period. read more

Overall, investors will want to learn how these companies are ""navigating what has really become a difficult economic environment for them,"" marked by supply chain snags, rising costs and slowing demand, Meckler said.

""The megacaps have historically proven incredibly resilient,” Meckler said.

254,202,Microsoft,2022-07-26,Morning Bid: Earnings to the rescue?,"













A look at the day ahead in markets from Tommy Wilkes.

The European corporate earnings season picks up pace on Tuesday and the evidence so far is that rising costs and slowing demand are beginning to bite.

A few weeks back the big concern for traders was that the next leg lower for stock markets would be triggered by the rewriting of lofty earnings expectations.

While this hasn't come to pass thanks to some businesses doing better than expected, the evidence on Tuesday suggests caution.

Swiss bank UBS (UBSG.S) flagged a smaller-than-expected rise in second-quarter net profit and Logitech International (LOGN.S) reported a 38% fall in first-quarter adjusted profit and cut its full-year 2023 outlook.

According to Goldman Sachs, around 34% of the European companies reporting results for the second quarter have missed consensus by at least 5%, the highest fraction of misses since the sovereign debt crisis in 2010.

Trading was quiet across markets as investors brace for a slew of European companies to update this week as well as some of the big tech firms in the United States, including Microsoft on Tuesday.

Stocks looked set for modest declines in both Europe and the United States, while the dollar steadied not far from two-decade highs.

The start of a two-day Federal Reserve meeting, which concludes Wednesday, is also keeping traders on the sidelines with policymakers expected to raise interest rates by 75 basis points. Market attention will be squarely focused on the future path of interest rates.

Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Tuesday:

U.S. Federal Reserve starts two-day meeting

U.S. May home price index

U.S. June new home sales data

U.S. 5-year Treasury auction

Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia issues July Non-manufacturing Business Outlook Survey for July

255,52,Microsoft,2022-07-26,Microsoft soothes market fears with forecast for strong revenue growth,"













July 26 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Tuesday forecast revenue this fiscal year would grow by double digits, driven by demand for cloud computing services and sending shares up 5%.

The strong outlook shows Microsoft continues to benefit from the pandemic-led shift to hybrid work models and comes at a time when investors are bracing for an economic downturn, with inflation roaring and consumers cutting spending.

Bob O’Donnell, an analyst for TECHnalysis Research, said Microsoft's forecast shows that despite the negative economic trends, companies continue to move more business and work online.

""I don't think it's unique to Microsoft,"" he said about the outlook. ""Microsoft is extraordinarily well positioned because of the range of businesses it has and the critical role their software and computing services play for organizations.""

Despite the positive forecast for the fiscal year starting July 1, Microsoft results for the fourth quarter amounted to a slight miss, hurt by a stronger dollar, slowing sales of PCs and lower advertiser spending.

Still Microsoft had its best quarter for its cloud business with record bookings for its cloud service called Azure, said Brett Iversen, Microsoft's general manager of investor relations.

Azure growth was 40%, missing the 43% analyst target compiled by Visible Alpha. It was up 46% if foreign exchange factors are eliminated. In its broader Intelligent Cloud division, revenue was up 20% to $20.9 billion, ahead of the average Wall Street target of $19.1 billion, according to Refinitiv.

For the first quarter ending Sept. 30, the Intelligent Cloud division was forecast to bring in $20.3 billion to $20.6 billion, with the upper end slightly above analysts' forecasts.

""We are seeing larger and longer-term commitments and won a record number of $100 million-plus and $1 billion-plus deals this quarter,"" said CEO Satya Nadella. ""We have more data center regions than any other provider and we will launch 10 regions over the next year.""

Microsoft faces pressure from a stronger greenback as it gets about half of its revenue from outside the United States. That led the company to lower its fourth-quarter profit and revenue forecasts in June. Shares of the Redmond, Washington-based company have fallen about 25% this year. read more

The U.S. dollar index rose over 2% in the quarter ended June and nearly 12% this year, compared to a 1% drop a year earlier for the same period.

Without the stronger dollar, the company's 12% year-on-year revenue growth would have been 4 percentage points higher, Iversen told Reuters. Three main factors reduced fourth-quarter revenue by about $1 billion.

Foreign exchange negatively impacted revenue by nearly $600 million. A slowdown in the PC market hit Windows OEM revenue by over $300 million. And advertising spend slowdown hit LinkedIn and Search and news ad revenue by over $100 million.

""With Microsoft being the size that they are, it's hard for them not to reflect the overall economy,"" John Freeman, vice president of equity research at CFRA Research. ""We've got inflation and that's obviously going to dampen consumer demand.""

Softer consumer demand also hit gaming revenue, which fell 7% year-on-year due to a drop in Xbox hardware, content and services, the company said. It is expected to fall in the low to mid-single digits this quarter, driven by declines in first-party content.

Microsoft reported revenue of $51.87 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with $46.15 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $52.44 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

Net income rose to $16.74 billion, or $2.23 per share, during the quarter ended June 30, from $16.46 billion, or $2.17 per share, a year earlier.

Summary Companies Microsoft, Alphabet results spark rally in growth stocks

Fed announces rate hike in unanimous decision

Indexes: Dow up 1.4%, S&P 500 up 2.6%, Nasdaq up 4.1%















NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq jumped more than 4% on Wednesday in its biggest daily percentage gain since April 2020 as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates as expected and comments by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell eased some investor worries about the pace of rate hikes.

Quarterly reports from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and others added to the day's upbeat tone.

The S&P 500 growth index (.IGX) jumped 3.9% and also registered its biggest one-day percentage gain since April 2020. Tech and growth stocks, whose valuations rely more heavily on future cash flows, have been among the hardest hit this year.

The S&P 500 closed at its highest level since June 8, with the technology sector (.SPLRCT) giving the index its biggest boost.

The Fed, in a statement following its two-day meeting, raised the benchmark overnight interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point. The move came on top of a 75 basis points hike last month and smaller moves in May and March, in an effort by the Fed to cool inflation. read more

Powell's comments in a news conference after the statement gave some investors hope for a slower pace of rate hikes.

Equity investors have been worried that aggressive hikes by the Fed could tip the economy into recession.

""He did not commit to any specific rate hike in the September meeting,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. read more

Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia, said it was ""a calming statement, coming on the heels of a day where you saw some earnings and revenues that were better than expectations, albeit expectations that were very tempered.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 436.05 points, or 1.37%, to 32,197.59, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 102.56 points, or 2.62%, to 4,023.61 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 469.85 points, or 4.06%, to 12,032.42.

Wednesday's hike was widely anticipated by investors.

Microsoft rose 6.7% after it forecast double-digit growth in revenue this fiscal year on demand for cloud computing services.

Alphabet jumped 7.7%, a day after it reported better-than-expected sales of Google search ads, easing worries about a slowing ad market. read more

T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) added 5.2% after it raised its subscriber growth forecast for the second time this year and exceeded quarterly profit expectations. read more

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.56 billion shares, compared with the 10.88 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 5.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.15-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and 30 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 50 new highs and 107 new lows.

LONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - Security researchers at Microsoft (MSFT.O) have said an Austrian firm was behind a string of digital intrusions at banks, law firms and strategic consultancies in at least three countries.

The firm, DSIRF, developed spyware - malicious software designed to spy on or steal information from a target's device - called ""Subzero"" which uses so-called Zero-day exploits to access confidential information such as passwords, or logon credentials, Microsoft said in a blog post on Wednesday.

""Observed victims to date include law firms, banks, and strategic consultancies in countries such as Austria, the United Kingdom, and Panama,"" the post said, without identifying the victims.

Vienna-based DSIRF, or DSR Decision Supporting Information Research Forensic GmbH, did not respond to email and telephone requests for comment.

Zero-day exploits are serious software flaws of great value to both hackers and spies because they work even when software is up to date.

The term comes from the amount of warning users get to patch their machines protectively; a two-day flaw is less dangerous because it emerges two days after a patch is available.

Some cybersecurity firms develop such tools to deploy alongside routine ""pentesting"", or penetration testing, to test a company's digital defences against malicious attacks.

""Microsoft's interaction with a victim confirmed they had not consented to red teaming and malware deployment, and confirmed it was unauthorised activity,"" Microsoft Security Unit general manager Cristin Goodwin, who authored the report, told Reuters.

According to a copy of an internal presentation published last year by German news website Netzpolitik, DSIRF advertises Subzero as a ""next generation cyber warfare"" tool which can take full control of a target's PC, steal passwords, and reveal its location.

Another one of the slides in that presentation showed several uses for the spyware, including anti-terrorism and the targeting of human trafficking and child pornography rings.

Microsoft's findings come as the United States and Europe mull tighter rules around vendors of spyware, a fast-growing and under-regulated global industry, and after the Pegasus spyware developed by Israel's NSO was found to have been used by governments to spy on journalists and dissidents.

""This industry appears to be thriving,"" Shane Huntley, Senior Director of the Threat Analysis Group at Alphabet (GOOGL.O), told a U.S. House of Representatives committee on Wednesday.

258,67,Microsoft,2022-07-27,"Microsoft, Alphabet results raise hopes about Big Tech weathering slowdown","













July 27 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) results sparked a relief rally on Wednesday in heavyweight technology and growth shares as investors expressed confidence in Big Tech's ability to navigate a recession.

High-growth and megacap companies have powered the U.S. stock market for the past decade, but rising interest rates to combat decades-high inflation as well as a recent sharp rally in the dollar have taken a toll on the stocks.

The rate-sensitive growth stocks (.RLG) fell 25% this year as the Federal Reserve began its monetary policy tightening, compared with a near 18% fall in the S&P 500 index.

An eagerly-anticipated interest rate decision by the Fed later on Wednesday will be pivotal for the rate-sensitive group. The central bank is expected to raise rates by 75 basis points.

Alphabet shares rose 4.5% after the company reported better-than-expected Google ad sales, while Microsoft rose 3.1% after it said it targets double-digit growth in fiscal revenue. read more

""The guidance was pretty good and that helped the market know that the landscape is definitely slowing but at the end of the day, good companies are going to navigate it well,"" said Burt White, chief strategy officer at Carson Group.

""The market has rebounded and is now looking for leadership from some of the big tech names.""

Focus will now be on ad revenue at Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O) after disappointing results from Snapchat's owner Snap Inc (SNAP.N) last week sparked a selloff in social media and ad tech firms. read more

Meta shares rose 2.7%, while Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), which are slated to post reports on Thursday, firmed 2.5% and 0.5%, respectively.

Growth stocks and interest rates

That would conclude results from the largest U.S. firms - Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon - which together account for nearly a quarter of the weight in the benchmark S&P 500 index (.SPX). read more

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/Pool















July 27 (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband sold his shares of chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA.O) on Tuesday, days before the House is expected to consider legislation providing subsidies and tax credits worth over $70 billion to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry.

In a periodic transaction report, the senior Democrat disclosed that her husband, financier Paul Pelosi, sold 25,000 shares of Nvidia for about $4.1 million, ending up with a loss of $341,365.

Paul Pelosi frequently trades shares of companies popular with many investors, including Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and other tech companies.

Transaction reports filed by Pelosi, a multi-millionaire, show her husband bought 5,000 Nvidia shares in July 2021, and that he exercised options to buy another 20,000 Nvidia shares last June.

The Senate is expected to vote on final passage in coming days of legislation providing about $52 billion in government subsidies for U.S. semiconductor production, as well as an investment tax credit for chip plants estimated to be worth $24 billion.

The legislation, which aims to make the domestic chip industry more competitive with China's, would then be taken up in the U.S. House under Pelosi's direction.

Last year, Pelosi defended the rights of federal lawmakers to trade stocks, but she later responded to calls for a ban on trading by lawmakers by signaling willingness to potentially advance such legislation.

A 2012 law makes it illegal for lawmakers to use information from their work in Congress for their personal gain. The law requires them to disclose stock transactions by themselves or family members within 45 days.

An analysis by Unusual Whales, a service selling financial data, concluded that congressional lawmakers last year traded $290 million in stocks, options, cryptocurrency and other assets, and that they outperformed the market, on average.

Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia is most valuable U.S chipmaker.

DUBLIN, July 27 (Reuters) - The Irish government on Wednesday said it will appoint two additional commissioners to Ireland's Data Protection Commission, lead regulator in Europe for tech giants Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, Meta Platforms (META.O) unit Facebook, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N)).

Minister for Justice Helen McEntee said the appointments will support existing commissioner Helen Dixon and improve the commission's ability to handle an increased workload and increasingly complex investigative requirements.

Ireland regulates a number of large U.S. internet giants because their European Union headquarters are in the country, but its DPC has been criticised for long, plodding investigations into big tech multinationals. Pressure has been building for a pan-European approach to data and privacy protection.

Dixon's office has so far completed three investigations of multinationals under new EU privacy rules introduced in 2018, including hitting WhatsApp with a 225 million euro fine last year.

Speaking to Reuters in February, Dixon said staffing at the regulator has increased to 195 from 27 in 2014 and the numbers needed to be increased more. However, she dismissed calls for another two commissioners to be appointed to speed up the processing of the backlog in cases.

""We don't think a three-headed organisation will improve some of the issues that we have talked about in terms of perception of speed,"" she said.

Last month, the head of the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), Wojciech Wiewiorowski, called for a pan-European data protection enforcement model to ensure consistent high-level protection of fundamental rights to data protection and privacy across the European Union. read more

July 27 (Reuters) - European shares scaled near seven-week highs on Wednesday as a string of strong results from companies including Russia-exposed lender UniCredit and Britain's Smurfit Kappa provided some comfort in an otherwise gloomy environment.

Sentiment also got a lift after an upbeat outlook from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and strong ad sales growth by Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) overnight, with analysts also pointing out that a lot of disappointment in terms of earnings were already baked into valuations. read more

""You can argue that much of it was, because through the second quarter we have had a big de-rating pretty much across all markets, there was some degree of disappointment priced in,"" said Ian Williams, economist and strategist at Peel Hunt.

""It feels maybe now investors are assessing the company updates more on stock by stock basis against the background of concerns about growth, European gas supply and how much tightening the central banks are going to do to try and check off inflationary pressures.""

Second-quarter earnings for companies that are part of the STOXX 600 are expected to increase 23.1% from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv. Of the 35% that have reported so far, nearly 60% have topped estimates.

262,427,Microsoft,2022-07-27,Morning Bid: Fed day,"













A look at the day ahead in markets from Dhara Ranasinghe.

A second straight 75 basis-point interest rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve later on Wednesday looks like a done deal.

After all, when markets started to bet on a 100 bps move after latest inflation data, Fed policymakers reacted with a concerted push back.

But it's not quite time to move along. What Fed chief Jerome Powell says about prospects for a September policy move will be watched closely, and could be the trigger for another bout of volatility in markets that have switched their attention to the slowing economy.

In the meantime, strong U.S. and European company earnings - notably better-than-expected results at Microsoft and Google -- have lifted sentiment. European shares have opened higher, Wall Street seems set for a firmer session and Asian markets fared well earlier in the day.

But watch what the CEOs are saying: Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) after posting a 51% rise in second-quarter profit, was less optimistic about full-year prospects and warned about the economic outlook. read more

Also keep an eye on is Italy, where a surprise S&P Global decision to cut the outlook on Italy's sovereign credit rating outlook to stable from positive has sparked another selloff in bond markets.

Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Wednesday:

- China's industrial profits rebound in June

July 27 (Reuters) - Britain's blue-chip index rose on Wednesday, as a jump in oil stocks and strong forecasts from heavyweights Reckitt Benckiser and Lloyds Banking Group overshadowed concerns over a slowing economy and soaring inflation.

The FTSE 100 index (.FTSE) gained 0.6% and the domestically focussed midcap 250 (.FTMC) edged 0.4% higher. Both the indexes looked set to end the month with strong gains.

Shares of Reckitt Benckiser (RKT.L) climbed 2.8% to one-year highs as the maker of Dettol and Lysol cleaning products raised its full-year revenue forecast after steep price hikes helped it beat second-quarter sales expectations. read more

Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) rose 4.1% after it raised its dividend and full-year profitability forecast as rising interest rates outpace modest growth in provisions for troubled loans. read more

""Expectations were a bit lower, so the headline figures for Llyods met expectations, helped by the fact that the rise in interest rates by the Bank of England is helping profit margins,"" said David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital.

Adding to gains on the commodity-heavy FTSE 100, oil majors Shell (SHEL.L) and BP (BP.L) rose more than 1% each as crude prices climbed on a report of lower inventories in the United States and cuts in Russian gas flows to Europe.

Meanwhile, better-than-expected results from U.S. tech giants Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) boosted Wall Street, with investors bracing for a big interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve later in the day.

""With so many moving parts to consider, we expect markets to remain volatile after the FOMC meeting,"" Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of UBS Global Wealth Management wrote in a note.

Worries about aggressive monetary policy tightening and the energy crisis in Europe have raised fears of a potential recession. However, resilient defensive sectors such as healthcare and consumer staples and a weakening pound have aided the FTSE 100 this year.

Data released earlier showed shops and supermarkets in Britain increased prices by 4.4% in the 12 months to July, the largest rise since these records began in 2005, reflecting a jump in food and transport costs. read more

UK-listed shares of Rio Tinto (RIO.L) slipped 0.7% after the global miner reported a 29% drop in first-half profit and more than halved its dividend. read more

Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) jumped 10.4% to lead gains on the mid-cap index after the low-cost airline said it expected to deliver a material operating profit as revenue and pricing momentum continued to improve. read more

Summary Companies Federal Reserve raises rates 75 basis points

Wall St stocks rally as Powell speaks, dollar loses ground

U.S 10-yr Treasuries yield falls

Energy in focus with Europe/Russia gas crisis















NEW YORK/LONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - U.S. equities rose sharply and the dollar lost ground as investors bet the Federal Reserve would slow interest rate hikes following its announcement on Wednesday of an increase in rates in line with expectations.

Oil futures settled higher after a report of lower inventories in the United States, while cuts in Russian gas flows to Europe offset concerns about weaker demand and higher U.S. interest rates. read more

Ten-year U.S. Treasury bond yields - the reference rate for the global cost of capital - were volatile but pared most of their declines after Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke to reporters following the central bank's increase of its benchmark overnight interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point.

The Fed is pushing up rates to cool the sharpest inflation since the 1980s and signaled ""ongoing increases"" in borrowing costs may still be ahead despite evidence of a slowing economy. read more

Powell told reporters it will likely be appropriate to slow the pace of increases as rates get more restrictive and that the Fed wants to get to moderately restrictive levels by year-end.

He also said that a lack of visibility into the economy's future trajectory means the Fed can only provide reliable guidance on a ""meeting by meeting"" basis. read more

Some strategists pointed to Powell's lack of guidance for a specific rate hike in September and his comment that previous hikes would keep reducing inflation as potentially dovish signs.

While most asset classes chopped around after the Fed Statement came out at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT), stocks rose sharply as Powell spoke and Treasury yields took a dive before regaining ground.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 436.05 points, or 1.37%, to 32,197.59, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 102.56 points, or 2.62%, to 4,023.61 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 469.85 points, or 4.06%, to 12,032.42.

MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (.MIWD00000PUS) gained 1.71%.

""The Fed's comments suggest the pace of rate hikes will slow considerably in the coming months,"" said George Bory, chief investment strategist for fixed income with Allspring Global Investments.

Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis noted that Powell ""acknowledged the weakness showing up in real economic growth"" and was waiting for economic data in the next few months before giving guidance.

So this could mean ""even slower real growth and better inflation data suggesting not much more may be needed,"" Paulsen said.

Jack Ablin, chief investment officer and founding partner at Cresset Capital in Chicago said Wednesday's hike highlighted the most aggressive series of Fed moves since the 1980s when Paul Volcker was the Fed chair.

He added that anything other than the 75 basis point increase would have been negative: ""Too little would've undermined confidence in the Fed and too much would have undermined confidence in the economy.""

The dollar index fell 0.625%, with the euro up 0.79% to $1.0194.

The Japanese yen strengthened 0.26% versus the greenback at 136.58 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.2153, up 1.06% on the day.

Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 2/32 in price to yield 2.7794%, from 2.787% late on Tuesday. The 30-year bond last fell 34/32 in price to yield 3.0628%, from 3.008%. The 2-year note last rose 4/32 in price to yield 2.9797%, from 3.043%.

The market was also boosted on Wednesday by quarterly updates from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) that helped spark a relief rally in technology and growth shares as they boosted investor confidence in Big Tech's ability to navigate a recession. read more

But weighing on the mood was Europe's fragile energy situation with gas flows from Russia's Nord Stream 1 pipeline halving on Wednesday from already reduced levels. read more

Summary

Summary Companies Samsung says chip demand for phones, PCs to weaken further

Server clients may adjust inventory if recession occurs -Samsung

Toyota misses April-June output target

GM China operations lost $100 mln in Q2 due to curbs















July 28 (Reuters) - Asian tech firms from chipmaker Samsung to display panel maker LG Display warned of a sharp slowdown in demand for smartphones, TVs and gadgets as surging inflation and deepening concerns of a recession crimp consumer spending.

Comments from top company executives in Asia, often called the world's factory, echo warnings from U.S. and European firms who say shoppers with lower incomes are skipping discretionary items and sticking to cheaper basics when buying everyday necessities amid global uncertainty, the crisis in Ukraine and the impact of China's COVID lockdowns. read more

""As a downturn looms, consumption is expected to generally slow down except for essential goods,"" LG Display Co Ltd (034220.KS), a supplier of display panels to Apple (AAPL.O) and TV makers, said on Wednesday. read more

""Set makers and retailers in general are becoming more conservative in their business operations.""

Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS), the world's top maker of memory chips and smartphones, said on Thursday that ""PC and mobile demand is likely to see continued weakness.""

While demand from server or data centre customers is less affected by macroeconomic issues, server clients would also have to adjust their inventory if a recession occurs, the South Korean firm cautioned. read more

Data centre customers, backed by tech heavyweights including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) that reported strong quarters, have been a bright spot so far for chipmakers.

But Samsung's smaller rival SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS) on Wednesday warned of slowing spending from both smartphone customers and data centre customers. read more

""Recently, consumer sentiment has been rapidly shrinking due to deepening concerns over inflation and economic recession, and companies are now noticeably moving to cut costs,"" it said.

In recent weeks, U.S. chipmakers including Micron (MU.O) and AMD (AMD.O) have signaled waning demand as well after a two-year long semiconductor shortage that crimped production of consumer electronics and cars. read more

Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW) has also signalled that demand was cooling from consumer electronics customers as they use their own chip stockpiles. read more

Panasonic Holdings Corp (6752.T) posted a 39% plunge in June quarter profit and said the risk of an economic slowdown caused by geopolitical risks and inflation globally remains high.

The Japanese conglomerate said profits at its energy unit that supplies EV batteries to Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) fell mainly due to higher costs for raw materials and logistics. read more

CHINA PRESSURES

U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), a foundry customer of Samsung's, said: ""We expect the elevated uncertainty in the global economy and the impact of COVID measures in China will cause customers to act with caution in managing their purchases in the second half.""

Smartphone sales in China, the biggest market in the world, fell 14.2% in April-June while volumes hit a decade low, Counterpoint Research said on Wednesday. read more

While analysts expect stronger demand for iPhones than for other smartphones, Apple (AAPL.O) announced discounts in China this week, a move it occasionally makes when sales are slow.

Tech and auto firms with factories in China have faced business disruptions in the world's second-largest economy due to COVID-19 lockdowns even as the war in Ukraine has pushed up energy and logistics costs.

The curbs have taken a huge toll on China's economy, with its gross domestic product in the April-June quarter growing at the slowest pace in some three decades barring a contraction in the first quarter of 2020. read more

Earlier this month, China's automobile industry association cut its sales forecast for the year as COVID measures weighed on demand, which authorities are now trying to revive with incentives such as lower purchase tax for some cars.

Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), the world's largest automaker by sales, has seen its output hit in recent months by the chips shortage and supply constraints in China, producing 9.8% fewer cars over April-June than it initially planned. read more

General Motors Co (GM.N), which reported a 40% slump in second-quarter profit, said its China operations lost $100 million in the period due to the curbs. read more

A bellwether for global automaking, GM said it was curbing spending ahead of a potential economic slowdown, as did its crosstown rival Ford Motor Co (F.N). read more

Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS), which like Uniqlo parent Fast Retailing (9983.T) has seen the value of its profits lifted by a strong dollar, cautioned that rising inflation was posing some risks to demand in the second half. read more

For electric vehicles, however, some analysts say it would take another year for sales to slow, a view backed by Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) battery supplier LG Energy Solution Ltd (373220.KS).

LG Energy Solution said it expected solid demand in the second half of this year. read more

266,754,Microsoft,2022-07-28,Amazon sees resilient consumer demand as shares jump 13%,"













July 28 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) on Thursday said it expects a jump in third-quarter revenue, as the retailer collects bigger fees from Prime loyalty subscriptions and as consumer demand remained high in spite of rising inflation.

Shares of the world's largest online retailer rose 13% in trading after the bell, extending its market valuation by more than $150 billion.

Amazon, like much of the retail industry, is facing a reckoning. Major rival Walmart Inc (WMT.N) this week said it would make much less this year than it once expected. U.S. consumer confidence has tumbled to a recent low, and some are sticking to lower-priced essentials to manage economic woes.

That has not stopped Amazon. The online retailer projected net sales between $125 billion and $130 billion for the summer period, while analysts were expecting only $126.42 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

In a press release, Chief Executive Andy Jassy said the company is ""seeing revenue accelerate as we continue to make Prime even better for members, both investing in faster shipping speeds, and adding unique benefits such as free delivery from Grubhub for a year.""

In a positive sign for its operation, Amazon had more goods in stock than it did before the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told reporters on a conference call.

Amazon about doubled how many items it could deliver just a day after purchase, making progress on a long-term commitment, according to press releases. Its July marketing event Prime Day was the biggest ever by unit sales.

""It looks like Amazon is finally primed to turn the corner after a rocky couple of quarters,"" Insider Intelligence analyst Andrew Lipsman said.

BUYING PATTERNS

Asked about Walmart and changes in consumer buying patterns, CFO Olsavsky said, ""We did not notice a step down in June.""

Still, sales growth has slowed year-over-year in some of the retailer's business segments. In North America, the company's largest market, net sales climbed 10% in the just-ended second quarter, compared with a 22% gain in the same period a year ago. Its international unit saw an outright decline of 12%.

A changing of the guard has heralded the departures of Consumer CEO Dave Clark and corporate affairs head Jay Carney, as well as two of the company's most senior Black executives. A period of record profit gave way in the first quarter of 2022 to Amazon's first quarterly loss in seven years.

Ultimately, Amazon lost $2 billion in the second quarter, including a pre-tax valuation loss of $3.9 billion from its investment in Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN.O). But the company beat expectations in posting operating income of $3.3 billion, thanks entirely to its profitable cloud-computing division. Analysts on average had estimated $1.8 billion, according to research firm FactSet.

The company's extra costs from inflation, productivity and other items were $4 billion, in line with Amazon's expectations and about $2 billion less than it faced at the year's outset, Olsavsky said.

After racing to match demand during the height of the pandemic, doubling its fulfillment network in just two years, the company has started slowing warehouse openings to rein in costs. It has paused a major office space expansion in Bellevue, Washington, and it has not filled roles that became vacant in some facilities, lowering its full and part-time headcount from the March quarter.

It has raised some prices, too. After increasing U.S. fees for its fast-shipping club Prime, Olsavsky said subscription retention was as good or better than the company expected.

Cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services beat estimates, too. The unit posted revenue of $19.7 billion, ahead of the more than $19.5 billion analysts had estimated Amazon would collect for the second quarter.

Asked about a potential slowdown, Olsavsky said on an analyst call that a downturn in 2008 resulted in companies choosing to use Amazon's cloud services rather than build their own data centers, giving AWS a boost. Rival Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) likewise said earlier this week that its fiscal-year revenue would jump on demand for its cloud services. read more

Adjusting for items, Amazon reported earnings per share of 18 cents, above the consensus for a per share profit of 13 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

267,435,Microsoft,2022-07-28,EXCLUSIVE EU mulls new unit with antitrust veterans to enforce tech rules - sources,"













BRUSSELS, July 28 (Reuters) - The European Commission is considering creating a new directorate that may be headed by two top antitrust officials to enforce tough new rules aimed at reining in the powers of Big Tech, two people familiar with the matter said.

Such a move could ease concerns that the EU competition watchdog may struggle to get technology giants such as Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Meta and Microsoft (MSFT.O) to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). read more

The landmark rules, agreed in March, will go into force next year. They will bar the companies from setting their own products as preferences, forcing app developers to use their payment systems, and leveraging users' data to push competing services.

The new directorate at the Commission's powerful antitrust arm may be headed by Alberto Bacchiega, director of information, communication and media, in charge of antitrust and merger cases involving the tech, media and consumer electronics industries, one of the people said.

Bacchiega could also be assisted by Thomas Kramler, head of the unit dealing with antitrust cases in e-commerce and data economy, and currently spearheading investigations into Apple and Amazon, the person said.

Both officials are already liasing with those at the Commission's Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology which will jointly enforce the DMA, a third person said.

Bacchiega and Kramler could not be reached for comment as they are away on their summer holiday.

The EU executive said it was organising itself internally so that it can enforce the DMA effectively.

""The enforcement of the DMA is estimated to require approximately 80 staff who would be redeployed internally, as appropriate,"" a spokeswoman said.

""The internal organisation will be based on the relevant expertise of all DGs (directorate-generals) and services involved, and ensure appropriate staffing of the relevant DGs and services,"" she said.

268,616,Microsoft,2022-07-29,Sony trims profit forecast after games business falters,"Summary

Summary Companies Cut gaming unit annual forecast by 16%

Gaming unit op profit fell 37% in Q1

Game software sales slumped 26% to 47 mln units

Lack of high profile titles, COVID easing have hurt demand -CFO















TOKYO, July 29 (Reuters) - Sony Group Corp (6758.T) trimmed its profit forecast on Friday after a weak first quarter for its PlayStation business, which it blamed on waning consumer interest due to a lack of new games and an easing of COVID-19 constraints dampening stay-at-home gaming.

Sony said the business would draw support, however, from its upcoming game slate and as it addresses supply chain snags that have disrupted production of its hit PlayStation 5 console.

""Last quarter was just a bump in the road for Sony,"" said Serkan Toto, founder of the Kantan Games consultancy.

""It looks like Sony is actually now getting more and more PS5s into stores, especially in the U.S. and Europe.""

Operating profit at Sony's key gaming unit fell 37% in the April to June quarter from a year ago, which Chief Financial Officer Hiroki Totoki blamed on a lack of top titles and the return of normalcy to people's lives amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The growth of the overall game market has decelerated as opportunities to go out have increased following a decline in COVID infections,"" Totoki said.

Sony cut the annual operating profit forecast for its gaming unit by 16%, citing an expected fall in games sales from external developers while booking expenses from an earlier-than-expected closing of its deal for ""Halo"" creator Bungie.

Its group-wide operating profit forecast for the year to next March was cut by 4% to 1.11 trillion yen ($8.37 billion).

Sony posted a 9.6% rise in first-quarter operating profit to 307 billion yen, beating analyst estimates, boosted by demand for its movies and television shows.

The conglomerate has said it aims to sell 18 million of its hit PS5 consoles this fiscal year as supply chain snarls ease and it ramps up production. It sold 11.5 million units in the year ended March.

""With recovery from the impact of the lockdown in Shanghai and improvement in component supply we are working to bring forward supply for the year-end holiday season,"" Totoki told a news briefing.

Sony sold 2.4 million PS5 units in the first quarter, only a slight increase from the same period a year earlier, while software sales slumped 26% to 47 million units.

Sony competes with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), which is aggressively acquiring content to push to its Xbox Game Pass subscription service.

Sony's Redmond, Washington-based rival this week reported a decline in gaming revenues in its fourth quarter and upcoming high-profile game titles have been delayed.

PlayStation's pipeline includes hotly awaited titles such as a remake of ""The Last of Us"" in September and ""God of War Ragnarok"", due for release in November.

Sony shares closed flat ahead of earnings. The group's shares have lost around a fifth of their value this year, compared with a 3% drop in the blue-chip benchmark Nikkei 225 (.N225).

REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo















July 29 (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) added about $175 billion to their combined market value on Friday after upbeat results boosted investor confidence on the ability of these firms to weather a slowdown in the economy.

While analysts noted these companies were not completely immune to broader economic hurdles, they said the weakness in consumer spending is not likely to send these firms into the red, deeming them ""always reliable to buck the trend.""

Amazon's shares rose about 11% to $135.50 after the e-commerce titan forecast upbeat third-quarter revenue, while those of Apple rose more than 3% as the company said appetite for iPhones remained strong despite consumers tightening spending.

""The results are good enough to support Apple's stock which has done much better in the current market rout, further justifying the company's 'safe haven' status when the going gets tough,"" Haris Anwar, Investing.com analyst, said.

The U.S. stock market's hyper surge in the past decade has been fuelled by high-growth and megacap companies, but rising interest rates to combat decades-high inflation as well as a sharp rally in the dollar have taken a toll since the start of the year.

Earlier this week, upbeat results from Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) reassured investors burnt by a slump in their shares in the first half of the year.

Amazon, like much of the retail industry, is bracing for a pullback in consumer spending as people stick to lower-priced essentials to tide over economic woes.

The e-commerce giant's booming cloud business, coupled with a ramp up in service offerings, is likely to help cushion the impact of soaring costs.

Kingsview Investment Management portfolio manager Paul Nolte, however, was more skeptical in the light of warnings from some major retailers including Walmart (WMT.N).

""We think that the consumer is not as strong as maybe portrayed by the reaction to Amazon.""

270,87,Microsoft,2022-07-29,Austrian spy firm accused by Microsoft says hacking tool was for EU states,"













LONDON, July 29 (Reuters) - An Austrian firm which Microsoft (MSFT.O) said created malicious software that was detected on the computer systems of some of its clients in at least three countries has said its spying tool ""Subzero"" was for official use in EU states only.

On Wednesday, Microsoft said the firm, DSIRF, had deployed the spying software, or spyware -- capable of accessing confidential information such as passwords or logon credentials -- at an unspecified number of unidentified banks, law firms and strategic consultancies. read more

""Subzero is a software of the Austrian DSIRF GesmbH, which has been developed exclusively for official use in states of the EU. It is neither offered, sold nor made available for commercial use,"" DSIRF said in an emailed statement.

""In view of the facts described by Microsoft, DSIRF resolutely rejects the impression that it has misused Subzero software,"" it added.

It was not clear which EU member state governments, if any, were using the tool. DSIRF did not respond to requests for further comment.

Austria's interior ministry told local news agency APA on Friday that it was investigating the Microsoft claims. The ministry did not respond to requests from Reuters for comment.

Spyware tools have come into increased focus in Europe and the United States after Pegasus, spyware developed by Israel's NSO, was found to have been used by governments to spy on journalists and dissidents.

DSIRF said they had commissioned an independent expert to investigate the issues raised by Microsoft, and had reached out to the U.S. tech giant for ""collaboration on the issue"".

Microsoft declined to offer further comment.

In its Thursday blog post, the company said DSIRF had developed four so-called ""zero-day exploits"", serious software flaws of great value to both hackers and spies because they work even when software is up to date.

DSIRF listed a handful of previous, commercial, clients as references in an internal presentation promoting Subzero that was published by German news website Netzpolitik last year.

Two of the companies that were named in that presentation, SIGNA Retail and Dentons, told Reuters they had not used the spyware and had not consented to be a reference for the company.

DSIRF did not respond to a request for comment on the matter.

Aug 1 (Reuters) - Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) has started to lay off employees in the United States, The Information said on Monday, citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter.

The publication in July reported that Oracle was considering cutting thousands of jobs in its global workforce after targeting cost cuts of up to $1 billion. https://bit.ly/3OVYkoq

The company had about 143,000 full-time employees as of May 31, according to its latest annual report.

The layoffs at Oracle will affect employees at its offices in the San Francisco Bay Area, Monday's report said, but it did not mention the number of employees affected. https://bit.ly/3Q7awTC

Oracle did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The report also said layoffs in Canada, India and parts of Europe were expected in the coming weeks and months.

Technology giants Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) have also discussed cuts or a slowdown in hiring plans in response to rising costs and fears of a recession.

272,279,Microsoft,2022-08-01,Big Tech in finance? There’s a regulator for that,"













WASHINGTON, Aug 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Technology companies have stormed the heights of consumer finance, but they don’t face the regulation that vexes their old-world rivals. While no single financial watchdog has oversight of Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O) or Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O), that could change. It all hangs on the views of a panel of watchdogs known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council.

When a company like Apple decides to offer financial services, the potential impact is huge. Take the iPhone maker’s new buy-now-pay-later service. It’s starting small, with six-week duration loans and a borrowing limit of $1,000. But unlike the Apple-branded credit card that’s effectively run by Goldman Sachs (GS.N), the lending decisions and funding for buy-now-pay-later loans are Apple’s own. Tim Cook’s firm is doing some of what a Citigroup (C.N) or Bank of America (BAC.N) does, but without the onerous regulation.

It's a question of potential rather than actual risk. Imagine half the number of iPhone users in the United States, or about 59 million based on estimates by Counterpoint research, end up using the pay-installment service. That would give Apple about as many consumer customers as General Electric’s (GE.N) financing arm, GE Capital, had in 2013. GE Capital required a bailout to back nearly $140 billion of its debt after it unraveled during the 2008 financial crisis.

The cloud divisions of Silicon Valley giants also play a systemic role. The largest banks like JPMorgan (JPM.N) rely on Amazon and others for various tasks, including housing data, processing transactions and running applications. About 45% of banks use Amazon while a similar proportion depends on Microsoft (MSFT.O), with many using both, according to S&P Global’s 451 Research. A disruption or failure through a hack or natural disaster could upend operations and cause a panic.

In GE’s case, it was FSOC that stepped in when it became clear that the regulatory framework had holes in it. The 15-member panel was created after the 2008 financial crisis, and now includes Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell, Securities and Exchange Commission chief Gary Gensler and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau head Rohit Chopra. The council designated GE Capital a systemic risk in 2013, and put it under the supervision of the Fed, where it stayed until 2016.

Tech companies would be a timely fit for FSOC. The group doesn’t perform day-to-day watchdog functions but can farm such duties out to an appropriate panel member. The Fed also took supervision of insurer AIG (AIG.N) after the 2008 financial crisis. Other FSOC members have their own expertise: the SEC’s is over capital markets, for example.

And as with GE, it wouldn’t need to throw a regulatory net around the whole of a company. Apple, say, could be asked to carve out its Apple Financing subsidiary into a separate holding company, which could then be subject to rules on underwriting, credit quality and stress testing. Cloud businesses like Amazon Web Service or Microsoft Azure could be deemed systemically important financial utilities, a label already applied to other forms of market plumbing like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

None of this would stop tech firms’ financial march, but it would slow them down. Regulated entities would need to have their own chief executive, board and come up with rules on cybersecurity and other areas. British authorities recently floated a range of options to make sure the financial system could withstand a cloud-computing snafu, including regular cyber resilience tests. And financial regulators often parachute examiners into the offices of the companies they supervise, who regularly check operations for risk management. That would be an unfamiliar intrusion for Silicon Valley.

Even if FSOC drags its feet, more red tape for tech firms is inevitable. In October, the CFPB asked Apple, Alphabet’s (GOOGL.O) Google, and Facebook about their payment systems. The agency can issue enforcement actions for violations of user privacy, among other concerns, and leader Chopra is no stranger to assertively using his position on other regulatory bodies – as he showed when he helped speed the exit of then-head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Donald Trump appointee Jelena McWilliams.

Still, a more coordinated approach would be better. With billions of users and lax regulation, the risks to consumers and the broader system from big tech firms are growing. Watchdogs, meanwhile, are often reacting to past threats. Putting Silicon Valley on FSOC’s agenda would help keep the financial cops ahead of the game.

274,659,Microsoft,2022-08-02,"Antitrust watchdogs go big on drama, light on plot","













NEW YORK, Aug 2 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Competition watchdogs are throwing the book at some some odd targets. The Department of Justice went to court read more on Monday with book publisher Penguin Random House over its $2.2 billion acquisition of smaller rival Simon & Schuster, a case whose witnesses include horror author Stephen King. Separately, the Federal Trade Commission is wrestling with Facebook owner Meta Platforms over its purchase of Within Unlimited, the maker of a virtual-reality fitness app. Both cases test new and important ideas. Meanwhile trustbusters risk missing out on the bigger picture.

Penguin Random House, owned by the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann (BTGGg.F), is the biggest book publisher in the United States so it’s not unusual that its merger with a rival would attract regulatory attention. What’s odd is that chief U.S. antitrust litigator Jonathan Kanter and his team are chiefly concerned that the deal would reduce writers’ payments read more , rather than that it will raise the price of books. And FTC head Lina Khan has complained that Meta’s purchase of Within, for an undisclosed price, is an attempt to “buy its way to the top” – even though the FTC didn’t gatecrash Mark Zuckerberg’s firm’s earlier acquisition of customer-service software maker Kustomer for $1 billion.

True, it makes sense for antitrust guardians to spend more time sweating the small stuff. Facebook was allowed to buy Instagram in 2012, a deal that presented no threat of consumers being saddled with rising prices since both companies’ products are free. Yet that merger helped what’s now Meta balloon to its present $430 billion in market value, with a dominant position in online advertising. The Department of Justice argues that Penguin Random House’s deal will lessen quality, choice and innovation, reflecting the reality that consumers can be harmed without being directly hit in the pocketbook.

Yet there are bigger deals to scrutinize, for more conventional reasons. Amazon.com (AMZN.O) closed its $8.5 billion purchase of movie studio MGM even though Khan has been a vocal critic read more of Jeff Bezos’ e-commerce empire and what she argues is its effect on competition. Microsoft (MSFT.O) too is pursuing its biggest acquisition to date, shelling out $69 billion for “Call of Duty” video-game maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) even though the software giant is home to one of the world’s most prominent gaming consoles, the Xbox. Since regulators have only finite resources, the search for a new plot creates the risk that the real story gets missed.

275,453,Microsoft,2022-08-08,Nvidia warns of lower second-quarter revenue on gaming weakness,"













Aug 8 (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) on Monday warned its second-quarter revenue would drop by 19% from the prior quarter on weakness in its gaming business, sending the chip designer's shares down about 8%.

The company reported preliminary results for the second-quarter, just days after chipmaker Intel Corp , Qualcomm (QCOM.O) and Sony Group (6758.T) forecast weak sales on demand concerns for personal computers and phones.

The gaming industry, largely considered to be recession proof, is beginning weaken as consumers weigh purchases of discretionary items such as video-game consoles.

Last month, Xbox-maker Microsoft (MSFT.O) reported a slump in gaming revenue while PlayStation-maker Sony trimmed its forecast.

Chipmakers have also been struggling with worsening supply-chain snarls ahead of the key holiday period due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and COVID-19 curbs in China's manufacturing hubs in recent months.

Nvidia said its gaming unit's preliminary revenue, which includes sales of high-end graphic cards for desktops and laptops, declined 44% from the previous quarter to $2.04 billion.

Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar said the magnitude of the decline was surprising, not the warning on gaming revenue.

""Nvidia's gaming slowdown likely includes the chips they sell to the crypto market which has been weak hence the extent of the slowdown is so significant,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande said in a note.

Nvidia increased the supply of cryptocurrency mining processors, which brought in $266 million in the second quarter last year.

The company expects to report overall second-quarter revenue of about $6.70 billion on Aug. 24.

Analysts had estimated revenue of $8.1 billion, with contribution from gaming at $3.12 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Data Center revenue hit a record, but fell short of estimates due to supply disruptions, Nvidia said, adding that quarterly results will include charges of $1.32 billion due to excess inventory and commitments in anticipation of demand.

Shares of chipmakers including peers AMD (AMD.O) and Qualcomm also fell on Monday.

276,474,Microsoft,2022-08-09,Roblox slides as bookings miss raise gaming slowdown worries,"













Aug 9 (Reuters) - Roblox Corp (RBLX.N) missed estimates for quarterly bookings on Tuesday, in yet another sign the gaming industry is facing a slowdown after a pandemic-fueled boom, sending shares of the gaming platform down around 19% in extended trading.

Roblox's downbeat results come as firms ranging from console makers and chip makers to video game publishers warn of a slowdown in the gaming world as red hot inflation hammers discretionary spending, challenging the idea of a ""recession proof"" industry.

The California-based Roblox, famous for its games ""Jailbreak"" and ""MeepCity"", posted net bookings of $639.9 million in the second quarter, compared with $665.5 million a year earlier. Analysts were expecting $644.4 million, according to Refinitiv data.

""We have seen impacts across the video game space due to changes in consumer discretionary spend, and that appears to be somewhat more pronounced in the free-to-play genre and mobile gaming,"" said Corey Barrett, head of TMT research at M Science.

Gaming demand, which saw a boom during the pandemic, slowly subsided as restrictions ease and people venture outside for other entertainment options.

While video gaming publishers Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO.O) and Electronic Arts Inc (EA.O) forecast weak annual sales, chipmaker Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) on Monday warned of lower second-quarter revenue on weakness in its gaming business.

Last month, Xbox-maker Microsoft (MSFT.O) reported a slump in gaming revenue, while PlayStation-maker Sony trimmed its forecast on waning consumer interest in video games.

On an adjusted basis, Roblox reported loss of 30 cents per share, compared to estimates of 21 cents per share loss, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

Bookings for July were up between 8% and 10% year over year, while Daily Active Users (DAUs) rose 26%.

Roblox shares fell 15% to $40.40 in after hours trading on Tuesday. The stock has shed more than 50% in value so far this year.

277,808,Microsoft,2022-08-10,Wall Street rally lifts Nasdaq 20% from low as inflation fears ebb,"Summary

Summary Companies Fed now seen delivering 50 bps hike in September

U.S. consumer price growth slows in July

Musk sells Tesla shares worth $6.9 bln

Volatility index closes at four-month low















NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Wall Street surged on Wednesday, putting the Nasdaq more than 20% above its June low, after U.S. inflation slowed more than expected in July and raised hopes the Federal Reserve will become less aggressive on interest rates hikes.

A sharp drop in the cost of gasoline helped the U.S. Consumer Price Index stay flat last month after advancing 1.3% in June, the Labor Department said. The CPI rose by a less-than-expected 8.5% over the past 12 months after a 9.1% rise in June. read more

The rally came in the wake of the first notable sign of relief for Americans who have watched inflation steadily climb. The Nasdaq now is up 20.8% since bottoming but still needs to pass its prior peak in November to confirm a new bull market.

Fed funds futures traders are now pricing in only a 43.5% chance that the U.S. central bank hikes rates by 75 basis points when it meets in September, compared with 68% before the data. A 50 basis point hike is seen as a 56.5% probability. read more

""For the market, it's sort of a Goldilocks scenario right now because you have the labor market holding up and inflation potentially starting to come down. That is what a soft landing would look like,"" said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi U.S. Wealth Management in New York.

But one month of slowing inflation is not enough for the Fed to send an all-clear signal, Snyder said.

The rally on Wall Street was broad-based, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors rising in a sea of green. Growth stocks (.IGX) rose more than value (.IVX), while Dow transports (.DJT), small caps (.RUT) and semiconductors (.SOX) also rose.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 535.1 points, or 1.63%, to 33,309.51, while the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 87.77 points, or 2.13%, to 4,210.24 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 360.88 points, or 2.89%, to 12,854.81.

It was the biggest single-day gain for both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 in two weeks, and for the Dow in three weeks. It was the highest close for the S&P 500 since early May.

""(Inflation at) 8.5% is still very high, but there is optimism that perhaps June was the peak,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab.

Producer prices data for July on Thursday along with August inflation and employment data for release next month could alter the course of the Fed again, Frederick said.

The Fed has hiked its policy rate by 225 basis points since March despite fears the sharp rise in borrowing costs could tip the U.S. economy into a recession.

The slowing of inflation was the first ""positive"" reading on price pressures since the Fed began tightening policy, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said, even as he signaled he believes the Fed has plenty more work to do. read more

After a rough start to the year, the benchmark S&P 500 is up nearly 15% from mid-June lows, largely on expectations the Fed will be less hawkish than anticipated in its efforts to provide a soft landing for the economy as it fights to curb inflation.

But the S&P 500 is 12% below its all-time high in January, having been in a bear market since then.

The CBOE Volatility index (.VIX), Wall Street's fear gauge, fell below the 20.00 level to close at more than a four-month low.

High-growth and megacap technology stocks, whose valuations are vulnerable to rising bond yields, rose as Treasury yields fell sharply across the board. Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) all rose more than 2% each.

Economy-sensitive banks (.SPXBK) advanced 2.7%, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) climbing about 3% each.

""Banks have underperformed and are now getting bid,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member of Great Hill Capital LLC, adding that investors are chasing the laggards that have not participated in the rally since June lows.

Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) rose 3.9% after Elon Musk sold $6.9 billion worth of shares in the electric vehicle maker to finance a potential deal for Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) if he loses a legal battle with the social media platform. Twitter gained 3.7%. read more

Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) jumped 5.8% after the Facebook parent said on Tuesday it had raised $10 billion in its first-ever bond offering. read more

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.33 billion shares, compared with the 10.98 billion average for the full session over the past 20 trading days.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 5.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.34-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted five new 52-week highs and 29 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 64 new highs and 54 new lows.

Aug 10 (Reuters) - (This Aug 10 story corrects typo in first paragraph. A previous version was corrected to change the name of the research firm in paragraph 5)

Gaming companies are facing a slowdown in demand for video games from pandemic highs, raising doubts about their ability to weather an economic downturn.

Rising prices and a lack of hit titles have added to problems for video game publishers Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) and Electronic Arts (EA.O) that are also battling supply-chain delays and a shift in consumer choices due to easing lockdowns.

The latest proof of that came on Tuesday from gaming platform Roblox (RBLX.N) whose revenue growth eased to just 30% from 83% two quarters ago. read more

U.S. consumer spending on video games fell 11% in June and is expected to decline 8.7% this year, data from analytics firm NPD showed.

""The job market is still hot, there is plenty of froth on the economy causing aggressive inflation and the relaxation of COVID restrictions are leading consumers to consider spending on more experiences outside of the home,"" said Jesse Divnich, senior vice president at Interpret, a video game market research firm.

Activision Blizzard reported smaller-than-expected quarterly profit, while rival Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO.O) warned of disappointing sales ahead.

""When you have 50% of big bank economists saying we might be in a recession in the next quarter or two, my attitude is... we're in a recession and... we are seeing some softness,"" Take-Two top boss Strauss Zelnick told analysts.

Console makers too have taken a hit as gaming revenue dropped for Xbox-maker Microsoft (MSFT.O), while PlayStation-maker Sony (6758.T) cut its forecast and Nintendo (7974.T) posted lower sales.

The weak demand comes as double whammy for these firms that are struggling with component shortages.

Gaming chipmakers are seeing a knock-on effect of the cooling demand. Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) said sales of its sales of graphic gaming cards fell, while Nvidia (NVDA.O) flagged a 19% sequential drop in revenue.

Analysts and company executives, however, expect the industry to grow above pre-pandemic levels, leaning on the launch of delayed titles and an easing of parts shortages.

Data firm Newzoo showed the global games market will generate $196.8 billion in 2022, gaining 2.1% compared to a 7.6% jump in 2021.

""Video games aren't bulletproof, but they do tend to fare well during challenging times,"" Steven Bailey, an analyst at research firm Omdia said.

279,395,Microsoft,2022-08-11,Ukraine cyber chief pays surprise visit to 'Black Hat' hacker meeting in Las Vegas,"













LAS VEGAS, Nev., Aug 11 (Reuters) - Ukraine's top cyber official addressed a room full of security experts at a hackers' convention following a two-day trip from the capital, Kyiv, to a golden casino in Las Vegas.

During his unannounced visit, Victor Zhora, the deputy head of Ukraine's State Special Communications Service, told the so-called Black Hat convention on Wednesday that the number of cyber incidents to have hit Ukraine tripled in the months following Russia’s invasion of his country in late February.

""This is perhaps the biggest challenge since World War Two for the world, and it continues to be completely new in cyberspace,"" Zhora told an audience at the annual conference.

Ukraine faced a number of ""huge incidents"" in cyberspace from the end of March to the beginning of April, Zhora said, including the discovery of the ""Industroyer2"" malware which could manipulate equipment in electrical utilities to control the flow of power.

Russian hackers also hit Ukraine at the onset of the war though a cyberattack that took down regional satellite internet service.

Since the beginning of the year, Ukraine had detected over 1,600 ""major cyber incidents"", Zhora said.

Zhora told Reuters in an interview that Microsoft, Amazon and Google had offered pro bono cloud computing services to the Ukrainian government as it moves its data out of the country, away from the destruction wreaked by Russian bombs and missiles.

Some of Ukraine's data archives are being held within data centers across ""multiple [European] countries,"" he added, without elaborating.

Zhora said his trip to Las Vegas took two days. He traveled to neighboring Poland to stay a night before flying to the United States.

Zhora said he would not waste time on the slot machines at the sprawling Mandalay Bay casino, where the Black Hat conference is being held: ""It would be inappropriate for me to gamble here while Ukrainian soldiers are defending our land.""

280,541,Microsoft,2022-08-11,"ValueAct takes stake in NYTimes, says paper could grow strongly","













Aug 11 (Reuters) - ValueAct Capital Management disclosed on Thursday it has built a nearly 7% stake in the New York Times Co (NYT.N)and thinks the newspaper company could grow more quickly by aggressively offering its all-access digital bundle that gives readers more than basic news.

The investment firm announced the new position in a regulatory filing on Thursday and told its own investors in a letter that the newspaper has ways to thrive despite headwinds facing the industry.

ValueAct said its research has determined that subscribers would be willing to pay a premium for the bundle, which includes Cooking, Games, product review website the Wirecutter, and sports website The Athletic, in addition to the news.

""This is an opportunity we believe management needs to drive with urgency, as it is the biggest lever to accelerate growth, deepen the NYT's competitive moat, and ensure long-term strength and stability of the platform,"" ValueAct's letter said.

The San Francisco-based investment firm declined to comment on the investment. In its filing, ValueAct said -- and a New York Times spokeswoman separately confirmed -- that it has had discussions with the New York Times, ""and anticipate having further discussions.""

The New York Times spokeswoman said the paper speaks regularly with shareholders about ""our strategy and how we believe we can drive significant shareholder value moving forward.""

News of the investment sent the New York Times' stock up more than 11%. Over the last 52 weeks the company's stock price has fallen 25.5%.

ValueAct said in the letter that the New York Times could see strong double-digit digital revenue growth and margin expansion by up to three times.

Bloomberg first reported the new investment moments before the company made its regulatory filing in which it said it owns a 6.7% stake and believes the company's shares are undervalued.

ValueAct in its filing said it owns 11,014,741 New York Times Co shares, which were acquired from June 13 through Aug. 11 at prices ranging from $29.17 to $32.10.

Unlike other investment firms that push for change publicly and often ask for board seats at target companies, ValueAct prefers to work with management behind the scenes. It has been investing more frequently in Japan in recent years but has also made investments in iconic American companies including Microsoft and Citigroup Inc in the last years.

The New York Times has a dual-class share structure, including one class that is publicly traded and another that is held largely by the family of Adolph Ochs, who bought the newspaper in 1896. The family has argued that the structure protects the company's long-term stability.

The New York Times publishes daily and had about 9.2 million paid subscribers, including about 8.4 million digital-only subscribers at the end of the second quarter.

281,558,Microsoft,2022-08-12,New York Times taps Bank of America amid ValueAct challenge,"













Aug 12 (Reuters) - The New York Times Co (NYT.N) has turned to Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and law firm Sidley Austin LLP for advice on how to handle a potential board challenge from ValueAct Capital Management LP, according to people familiar with the matter.

ValueAct, a San Francisco-based hedge fund, disclosed on Thursday that it owns a nearly 7% stake in the New York Times and argued the newspaper company could grow more quickly by aggressively marketing its all-access digital bundle that gives subscribers more than basic news. read more

The Ochs-Sulzberger family controls the New York Times through dual-class shares that allow it to install nine directors on the company's 13-member board.

The structure of the board would give ValueAct scope to challenge the company for one of the other four board seats in a shareholder vote. The New York Times is working with the bankers and lawyers to prepare for this possibility, the sources said.

Proxy solicitor Okapi Partners LLC, which works with companies as they count votes in shareholder meetings, is also advising the New York Times, the sources added, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential.

Representatives for the New York Times, ValueAct, Sidley, Okapi and Bank of America either declined to comment or could not be reached for comment. The New York Times said in a statement on Thursday that its management had met with ValueAct to exchange views.

In a regulatory filing on Thursday that disclosed its stake, the hedge fund said it would have discussions with the New York Times to see ""whether it makes sense for a ValueAct Capital employee to be on the issuer's board of directors.""

The New York Times has expanded beyond its core newspaper offering in recent years to include the sports website The Athletic, product review website Wirecutter, a cooking app and games. While its digital subscriptions have grown, its shares are worth about 30% less than what they were valued at about a year ago because advertisers have cut back on spending amid fears of an economic downturn.

ValueAct, founded by Jeffrey Ubben two decades ago and now run by Mason Morfit, typically avoids challenging companies for board seats through proxy contests and often secures board representation with the agreement of companies they invest in.

282,523,Microsoft,2022-08-15,Tiger Global slashes portfolio amid losses,"













NEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Investment firm Tiger Global Management, which lost billions of dollars in this year's technology meltdown, slashed or completely exited most of its holdings in the second quarter, potentially cutting its exposure to a recent stock rally, according to a filing released Monday.

Among the companies in which Tiger reduced positions are online used-car seller Carvana (CVNA.N), cyber company Crowdstrike Holdings (CRWD.O), software maker Snowflake (SNOW.N), payments company Nu Holdings , retailer JD.com (9618.HK), food delivery app Doordash (DASH.N), cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O).

It also dissolved its investments in Robinhood (HOOD.O) and Zoom Video Communications Inc (ZM.O) and Docusign Inc (DOCU.O), the filing showed.

Chase Coleman's hedge fund saw its flagship fund fall 50% in the first half of the year, as worries over the Federal Reserve’s tightening monetary policy and surging inflation slammed many of the growth and technology stocks the firm held. It is unclear, however, what its strategy has been since then. The firm did not immediately comment on the matter.

Many of the shares it had sold have since rebounded in a rally that has seen the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite gain 18.8% in the current quarter.

For instance, Carvana's shares more than doubled in price since the end of June, but Tiger sold its stake almost entirely. Shares of e-commerce and gaming firm Sea Ltd (SE.N) are up 35% in that time frame, while Snowflake has rebounded 23%. Tiger cut its positions in Sea and Snowflake by 39.4% and 68.9%, respectively.

In a letter to investors, the fund said it underestimated the impact of surging inflation but added it was making careful bets. read more

Quarterly filings known as 13-fs are one of the few ways that funds are required to disclose their long positions, but may not reflect current holdings. While the filings information is dated, they are closely watched for possible investment trends and potential future performance.

Summary Companies China cuts key rates as economic data disappoints

Growth outperforms value

Walmart shares inch up ahead of results Tuesday

Indexes: Dow up 0.5%, S&P 500 up 0.4%, Nasdaq up 0.6%















NEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Monday with megacap growth shares, extending the market's recent rally amid investor optimism the Federal Reserve can achieve a soft landing for the economy.

Shares of Apple Inc (AAPL.O) climbed 0.6%, while Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) rose 0.5% and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) jumped 3.1%.

Those stocks gave the S&P 500 and Nasdaq their biggest boosts as U.S. Treasury yields eased. China's central bank cut key lending rates in a surprise move to revive demand after the economy unexpectedly slowed in July. read more

Consumer staples (.SPLRCS) and utilities (.SPLRCU) sectors also had strong gains.

The S&P 500 has rebounded sharply since mid-June, helped last week by signs that inflation may have peaked in July. The benchmark remains down about 10% since Dec. 31.

""Market participants (are) looking at the Fed and saying, 'Hey, they're going to be cutting rates here sooner than we know, and that's going to be good for the equity market,'"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 151.39 points, or 0.45%, to 33,912.44, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 16.99 points, or 0.40%, to 4,297.14 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 80.87 points, or 0.62%, to 13,128.05.

The Fed since March has delivered a stiff set of interest rate increases in an effort to battle inflation. Some investors have worried that an aggressive pace of rate hikes by the U.S. central bank could push the economy into recession. read more

284,819,Microsoft,2022-08-15,Caste in California: Tech giants confront ancient Indian hierarchy,"[1/2] Guests arrive for at the Steve Jobs Theater for an Apple event at their headquarters in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 10, 2019. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo















OAKLAND, Calif, Aug 15 (Reuters) - America's tech giants are taking a modern-day crash course in India's ancient caste system, with Apple (AAPL.O) emerging as an early leader in policies to rid Silicon Valley of a rigid hierarchy that's segregated Indians for generations.

Apple, the world's biggest listed company, updated its general employee conduct policy about two years ago to explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of caste, which it added alongside existing categories such as race, religion, gender, age and ancestry.

The inclusion of the new category, which hasn't been previously reported, goes beyond U.S. discrimination laws, which do not explicitly ban casteism.

The update came after the tech sector - which counts India as its top source of skilled foreign workers - received a wake-up call in June 2020 when California's employment regulator sued Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) on behalf of a low-caste engineer who accused two higher-caste bosses of blocking his career.

Cisco, which denies wrongdoing, says an internal probe found no evidence of discrimination and that some of the allegations are baseless because caste is not a legally ""protected class"" in California. This month an appeals panel rejected the networking company's bid to push the case to private arbitration, meaning a public court case could come as early as next year. read more

The dispute - the first U.S. employment lawsuit about alleged casteism - has forced Big Tech to confront a millennia-old hierarchy where Indians' social position has been based on family lineage, from the top Brahmin ""priestly"" class to the Dalits, shunned as ""untouchables"" and consigned to menial labor.

Since the suit was filed, several activist and employee groups have begun seeking updated U.S. discrimination legislation - and have also called on tech companies to change their own policies to help fill the void and deter casteism.

Their efforts have produced patchy results, according to a Reuters review of policy across the U.S. industry, which employs hundreds of thousands of workers from India.

""I am not surprised that the policies would be inconsistent because that's almost what you would expect when the law is not clear,"" said Kevin Brown, a University of South Carolina law professor studying caste issues, citing uncertainty among executives over whether caste would ultimately make it into U.S. statutes.

""I could imagine that parts of ... (an) organization are saying this makes sense, and other parts are saying we don't think taking a stance makes sense.""

Apple's main internal policy on workplace conduct, which was seen by Reuters, added reference to caste in the equal employment opportunity and anti-harassment sections after September 2020.

Apple confirmed that it ""updated language a couple of years ago to reinforce that we prohibit discrimination or harassment based on caste."" It added that training provided to staff also explicitly mentions caste.

""Our teams assess our policies, training, processes and resources on an ongoing basis to ensure that they are comprehensive,"" it said. ""We have a diverse and global team, and are proud that our policies and actions reflect that.""

Elsewhere in tech, IBM told Reuters that it added caste, which was already in India-specific policies, to its global discrimination rules after the Cisco lawsuit was filed, though it declined to give a specific date or a rationale.

IBM's only training that mentions caste is for managers in India, the company added.

Several companies do not specifically reference caste in their main global policy, including Amazon (AMZN.O), Dell (DELL.N), Facebook owner Meta (META.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google (GOOGL.O). Reuters reviewed each of the policies, some of which are only published internally to employees.

The companies all told Reuters that they have zero tolerance for caste prejudice and, apart from Meta which did not elaborate, said such bias would fall under existing bans on discrimination by categories such as ancestry and national origin.

CASTEISM OUTLAWED IN INDIA

Caste discrimination was outlawed in India over 70 years ago, yet bias persists, according to several studies in recent years, including one that found Dalit people were underrepresented in higher-paying jobs. Debate over the hierarchy is contentious in India and abroad, with the issue intertwined with religion, and some people saying discrimination is now rare.

Government policies reserving seats for lower-caste students at top Indian universities have helped many land tech jobs in the West in recent years.

Reuters spoke to about two dozen Dalit tech workers in the United States who said discrimination had followed them overseas. They said that caste cues, including their last names, hometowns, diets or religious practices, had led to colleagues bypassing them in hiring, promotions and social activities.

Reuters could not independently verify the allegations of the workers, who all spoke on condition of anonymity, saying they feared harming their careers. Two said they had quit their jobs over what they viewed as casteism.

Some staff groups, including the Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) at Google's parent company, say explicit mention of caste in corporate rules would open the door to companies investing in areas such as data collection and training at the same levels as they do to protect other groups.

""Significant caste discrimination exists in the United States,"" said Mayuri Raja, a Google software engineer who is a member of the AWU and advocates for lower-caste colleagues.

Over 1,600 Google workers demanded the addition of caste to the main workplace code of conduct worldwide in a petition, seen by Reuters, which they emailed to CEO Sundar Pichai last month and resent last week after no response.

Google reiterated to Reuters that caste discrimination fell under national origin, ancestry and ethnic discrimination. It declined to elaborate further on its policies.

'NOT GOOD FOR BUSINESS'

Adding caste to a general code of conduct is not unheard of.

The World Wide Web Consortium, an industry standards body partly based in Massachusetts, introduced it in July 2020. California State University and the state Democratic Party have followed over the past two years.

In May this year, California's employment regulator, the Civil Rights Department, added caste to its example equal employment opportunity policy for employers.

Yet the move by Apple, a $2.8 trillion behemoth with more than 165,000 full-time employees globally, looms large.

The iPhone maker's fair hiring policy now states that Apple ""does not discriminate in recruiting, training, hiring, or promoting on the basis of"" 18 categories, including ""race, color, ancestry, national origin, caste, religion, creed, age"" plus disability, sexual orientation and gender identity.

By contrast, many employers are hesitant to go beyond laws with their primary policies, according to three employment attorneys including Koray Bulut, a partner at Goodwin Procter.

""Most companies simply quote from the federal and state statutes that list the protected categories,"" Bulut said.

Some companies have, however, gone further in secondary policies that govern limited operations or serve only as loose guidelines.

Caste is explicitly written into Dell's Global Social Media Policy, for example, and in Amazon sustainability team's Global Human Rights Principles and Google's code of conduct for suppliers.

Amazon and Dell confirmed they had also begun mentioning caste in anti-bias presentations for at least some new hires outside India. They declined to specify when, why and how broadly they made the addition, though Dell said it made the change after the Cisco lawsuit was filed.

The companies' presentations include explanations of caste as an unwanted social structure that exists in parts of the world, according to a Reuters review of some of the online training, with the Dell material referencing a recent lawsuit ""from the headlines.""

John-Paul Singh Deol, lead employment attorney at Dhillon Law Group in San Francisco, said that only including caste in training and guidelines amounted to ""giving lip service"" to the issue because their legal force is questionable.

This characterization was rejected by Janine Yancey, CEO of Emtrain, which sells anti-bias training to about 550 employers, and a longtime employment attorney.

""No company wants to have employee turnover, lack of productivity and conflict - that's just not good for business,"" she said.

Yet explicitly referencing caste would likely invite an increased number of HR complaints alleging it as a bias, Yancey added.

""Whenever you're going to call out something specifically, you're exponentially increasing your caseload,"" she said.

Apple declined to say whether any complaints had been brought under its caste provision.

South Carolina law professor Brown expects no immediate resolution to the debate over of whether companies should reference caste.

""This is an issue that ultimately will be resolved by the courts,"" he said. ""The area right now is unsettled.""

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid















Aug 15 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), run by billionaire Warren Buffett, has tripled its stake in online banking company Ally Financial Inc (ALLY.N) and increased its bet that ""Call of Duty"" video game maker Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) will be acquired by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

In a Monday regulatory filing describing its U.S.-listed equity investments as of June 30, Berkshire also said it exited what was once an $8.3 billion investment in Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and no longer owns Royalty Pharma Plc (RPRX.O), which buys drug royalties.

The filing does not specify whether Buffett or his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler made specific purchases and sales, but investors often try to mimic what Berkshire does. Larger investments are normally Buffett's.

Berkshire slowed its stock buying spree in the second quarter as U.S. stock markets fell, purchasing $6.2 billion of stocks and selling $2.3 billion. It had bought $51.1 billion and sold $9.7 billion in the first quarter.

Nevertheless, Buffett's conglomerate, which also owns dozens of businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Geico auto insurer, ended June with a $327.7 billion equity portfolio, led by $125.1 billion in Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

It also invested more than $33 billion in two oil companies, Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N), as oil prices surged following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Berkshire has since purchased another $1.7 billion of Occidental stock, boosting its stake to 20.2%. read more It also owns $10 billion of Occidental preferred stock.

In the second quarter, Berkshire's Ally stake grew to 30 million shares from about 9 million, while its Activision stake grew to 68.4 million shares, worth $5.3 billion, from 64.3 million.

The Activision investment is a form of arbitrage, where Buffett appears to be betting that investors are pessimistic that regulators will approve Microsoft's proposed $68.7 billion takeover of the company.

According to Monday's filing, Berkshire also increased its holdings during the second quarter in Apple, Celanese Corp (CE.N), Chevron, Markel Corp (MKL.N), McKesson Corp (MCK.N), Occidental and Paramount Global (PARA.O).

It reduced its holdings in General Motors Co (GM.N), Kroger Co (KR.N), Store Capital Corp (STOR.N) and US Bancorp (USB.N), the filing shows.

286,696,Microsoft,2022-08-16,Cloud hangs over U.S. chipmakers on worries data center growth could slow,"[1/2] 3D-printed clouds and figurines are seen in front of the Microsoft Azure cloud service logo in this illustration taken February 8, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/















Aug 16 (Reuters) - Cloud and data centers, the chip industry's strongest sector, may be its next problem: Signs are showing growth could slow in what has been a pillar during the COVID era as consumers signed up for cloud-based entertainment and companies retooled their offices.

Analysts say the cloud market has rarely had to weather a prolonged economic downturn since it rose to prominence in the last decade as more businesses adopted the technology, making it harder to predict if it's recession proof or it will be hit in an economic downtown.

As 40-year-high inflation weighs on consumers and economists debate recession signals, advertisers have been tightening their purse strings, say Big Tech companies.

“Investors are worried it's the next shoe to drop,"" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, adding that an advertising drought hurting the likes of Facebook (META.O) and Snapchat (SNAP.N) could spur cutbacks in data center investments.

Big Tech has reported slower annual cloud revenue growth rates this earnings season - Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google Cloud dropped over 8 percentage points, Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Azure dropped 6 percentage points, and Amazon.com's (AMZN.O) AWS dropped over 3 percentage points compared with the previous quarter.

Nathaniel Harmon research director of YipitData said the revenue growth of the cloud market was still significant, although noted there were pockets of weakness in regions like Europe creeping in.

The three companies have also said during the pandemic they will keep data center equipment longer, in some cases up to six years, from three, to save money.

“If they're going to be cutting back their spending on data center capacity, well that's fewer chips from Intel or AMD,” said Glenn O'Donnell Research Director at Forrester Research.

That concern was heightened with Intel Corp's (INTC.O) data center and AI group business dropping 16% to $4.6 billion missing Wall Street estimates by nearly $2 billion in its latest quarterly earnings reported.

And last week Micron Technology Inc (MU.O) warned of an even worse than expected outlook, this time adding that there was trouble not just in PCs and smartphone, but also in the cloud.

But it's not as simple as slower growth of the cloud market that's causing trouble, Micron's chief business officer Sumit Sadana, told Reuters. Part of the problem was a shortage of some chips holding up servers from being built leading to a pile up of other chips - a situation similar to the auto chip shortage.

According to Richard Barnett, chief marketing officer at Supplyframe, inventories across the server supply chain are at record highs but key parts are missing. “Assume 500 components are needed for a server, and 10 or 20 unavailable parts are preventing its completion.”

Still Sadana warned that companies, worried about the economy, were also being more conservative about buying chips.

O'Donnell at Forrester said he's seeing this across the tech sector. “As we're talking with our clients about their spending plans, a lot of them are saying, well, you know, we're not going to turn off the faucet, but we're going to close it a bit,” he said. “You're going to see some of that reflected in earnings from companies like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise as well.”

While executives and analysts debate the impact of the slower growth in the cloud market, Super Micro Computer Inc .(SMCI.O), which specializes in customized servers for new technology, said developments such as self-driving cars and the meta-verse are still bringing new waves of demand.

""There's a lot of pent up growth as projects go from lab projects to deployment,"" Michael McNerney, Super Micro's vice president of marketing and network security, said.

Aug 16 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.

Markets may be leaning toward a 'soft landing' for the U.S. economy, but treacherous winds still surround the runway.

Wall St stocks have climbed for two solid months, prompting an almost 25% bounce in the S&P500 (.SPX) since mid-June. Hopes centre on commodity-driven inflation rates peaking, allowing the Federal Reserve to ease off the monetary brakes and guide a gentler economic slowdown that avoids a deep recession.

Although Monday's economic soundings from China, U.S. housing and New York manufacturing showed that a slowdown is well underway around the world, it also stokes narratives of 'peak inflation' and a less aggressive Fed. China's surprise rate cut on Monday underlined that.

Oil prices continued to ease on Tuesday and Brent crude is again eyeing its lowest levels since before the invasion of Ukraine in February, with global demand worries mixing with speculation about an Iran nuclear deal and U.S. shale oil output rising to pre-COVID levels. read more Barclays moved to cut its average Brent price view for this year and next. read more

The problem for the Fed and investors is that markets run ahead of themselves by reversing the tightening of overall financial conditions the Fed deems necessary to get inflation back to target. read more

A whopping 150-basis-point drop in U.S. junk bond spreads in little over a month speaks loudly to that, as does the more than half-point drop in 30-year mortgage rates since mid-year.

Jason Draho at UBS Global Wealth Management reckons a ""disconnect"" between buoyant stocks and the deeply inverted U.S. yield curve ""implies one of them isn't right"" - but it could be several weeks before that becomes any clearer.

U.S. July industrial production and housing starts top the data slate later on Tuesday, while earnings from Walmart (WMT.N) and Home Depot (HD.N) give a snapshot of what it's like in the shops.

On the dashboard, S&P500 futures and Treasury yields are mostly flat and the dollar stronger .

High commodity prices saw bumper earnings and a record dividend from miner BHP Group (BHP.AX), lifting its shares 4% and boosting the sector more broadly. read more

And in one circular flow from high oil prices, filings showed Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) used swooning market prices to load up on U.S. stocks such as Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Zoom and Microsoft and whole host of mega caps. read more

Key developments that may provide market direction on Tuesday:

Yonhap via REUTERS















SEOUL, Aug 16 (Reuters) - South Korea agreed on Tuesday to expand its global health partnership with the foundation set up by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates.

The deal came after Gates arrived in South Korea late on Monday, calling for Seoul to play a bigger role in global health and to increase aid.

The agreement includes strengthening private and public sector cooperation between the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and South Korea in projects such as a global health research fund, and stepping up cooperation with health organisations including CEPI, South Korea's foreign and health ministries said in a statement.

The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) works with public, private, philanthropic and civil society organisations to develop vaccines against future epidemics.

South Korea will also help to train 370 people from lower-income countries in vaccine production this year, which will be expanded to 2,000 people per year starting 2026, the ministries said.

""This is a crisis moment for global health. This is also a fantastic time for our foundation to strengthen partnership with Korea, providing great ideas for new tools and more resources to help those in need,"" Gates said in a speech at the National Assembly earlier on Tuesday.

While meeting with South Korean National Assembly Speaker Kim Jin-pyo and other lawmakers, Gates called for increasing funding for groups that help improve health conditions in poor countries and prevent pandemics, and asked if South Korea would be able to scale up its international aid to 0.3% of GDP.

Gates then met President Yoon Suk-yeol, who said the South Korean government wanted a cooperative relationship with Gates' foundation to foster high-quality bio-health technologies.

Gates also met with leaders at SK Bioscience (302440.KS) which received $10 million in funding from CEPI to develop its COVID-19 vaccine.

289,473,Microsoft,2022-08-16,"OK Google, get me a Coke: AI giant demos soda-fetching robots","













MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Aug 16 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google is combining the eyes and arms of physical robots with the knowledge and conversation skills of virtual chatbots to help its employees fetch soda and chips from breakrooms with ease.

The mechanical waiters, shown in action to reporters last week, embody an artificial intelligence breakthrough that paves the way for multipurpose robots as easy to control as ones that perform single, structured tasks such as vacuuming or standing guard.

Google robots are not ready for sale. They perform only a few dozen simple actions, and the company has not yet embedded them with the ""OK, Google"" summoning feature familiar to consumers.

While Google says it is pursuing development responsibly, adoption could ultimately stall over concerns such as robots becoming surveillance machines, or being equipped with chat technology that can give offensive responses, as Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and others have experienced in recent years.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) are pursuing comparable research on robots.

""It's going to take a while before we can really have a firm grasp on the direct commercial impact,"" said Vincent Vanhoucke, senior director for Google's robotics research.

When asked to help clean a spill, Google's robot recognizes that grabbing a sponge is a doable and more sensible response than apologizing for creating the mess.

The robots interpret naturally spoken commands, weigh possible actions against their capabilities and plan smaller steps to achieve the ask.

The chain is made possible by infusing the robots with language technology that draws understanding of the world from Wikipedia, social media and other webpages. Similar AI underlies chatbots or virtual assistants, but has not been applied to robots this expansively before, Google said.

It unveiled the effort in a research paper in April. Incorporating more sophisticated language AI since then boosted the robots' success on commands to 74% from 61%, according a company blog post on Tuesday.

Fellow Alphabet subsidiary Everyday Robots designs the robots, which for now will stay confined to grabbing snacks for employees.

DUBAI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) bought shares in Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Zoom Video (ZM.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) as part of a wider pick of U.S. stocks, bringing the market value of the sovereign wealth fund's investment portfolio to about $40.8 billion at the end of the second quarter.

The PIF acquired 213,000 class A shares in Alphabet, 4.7 million class A shares in Zoom and 1.8 million shares in Microsoft, a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed.

It also acquired shares in JPMorgan (JPM.N) and BlackRock (BLK.N), buying 3.9 million shares and 741,693 shares respectively.

The fund bought 6.3 million shares in Starbucks (SBUX.O), and added other stocks including Adobe Systems (ADBE.O), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), Salesforce (CRM.N), Home Depot (HD.N), Costco (COST.O), Freeport-McMoRan (FCX.N), Datadog (DDOG.O) and NextEra Energy (NEE.N).

The PIF, which manages $620 billion in assets, is at the centre of Saudi Arabia’s plans to transform the economy by creating new sectors and diversifying revenues away from oil.

The PIF is pursuing a two-pronged strategy, building an international portfolio of investments while also investing locally in projects that will help to reduce Saudi Arabia’s reliance on oil.

Summary Companies Walmart sees smaller profit drop this year

Home Depot beats sales estimates

U.S. Treasury yields rise

Indexes: Dow up 0.7%, S&P 500 up 0.2%, Nasdaq down 0.2%















NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The Dow and S&P 500 rose on Tuesday as stronger-than-expected results and outlooks from Walmart and Home Depot bolstered views on the health of consumers, while technology shares declined and weighed on the Nasdaq.

The S&P 500 consumer discretionary and staples sectors (.SPLRCT), (.SPLRCS) gave the benchmark index its biggest lift, while the S&P 500 retail index (.SPXRT) rose 1.9%.

The S&P 500 also came close to breaking above its 200-day moving average, a key technical level. The benchmark index has not closed above that level since early April.

Walmart Inc (WMT.N) shares jumped 5.1% after the retailer forecast a smaller drop in full-year profit than previously projected, while Home Depot Inc (HD.N) gained 4.1% after it surpassed estimates for quarterly sales. read more

At the same time, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose, weighing on technology and other high-growth stocks. Shares of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) were down 0.3% on Tuesday after recent gains.

After a harsh first half of the year, the S&P 500 is up nearly 14% since the start of July, helped in part by better-than-expected earnings from Corporate America.

Investors have also been optimistic lately that the Federal Reserve can achieve a soft landing for the economy as it tightens policy and raises interest rates to reduce decades-high inflation.

""When you transition from a bear market to a bull market, especially one where the Fed is raising rates and there are concerns over the consumer, you really want to see consumer discretionary underpinned by enthusiasm. And today's move in discretionary names is positive for the market,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Walmart in July slashed its profit forecast amid surging prices for food and fuel.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 239.57 points, or 0.71%, to 34,152.01, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 8.06 points, or 0.19%, to 4,305.2 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 25.50 points, or 0.19%, to 13,102.55.

With results in from the majority of S&P 500 companies, second-quarter earnings are expected to have risen 9.7% from a year earlier, compared with 5.6% estimated on July 1, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Shares of Target Corp (TGT.N), which reports quarterly results early on Wednesday, closed 4.6% higher.

Still, investors will be anxious to see July U.S. retail sales data, which is due on Wednesday as well. Also on Wednesday, the Fed is scheduled to release minutes from its July policy meeting.

Investor sentiment is still bearish, but no longer ""apocalyptically"" so, according to BofA's monthly survey of global fund managers in August. read more

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.92 billion shares, compared with the 10.96 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.22-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.21-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 8 new 52-week highs and 29 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 40 new lows.

292,793,Microsoft,2022-08-18,Asset managers on alert after 'WhatsApp' crackdown on banks,"Summary

Summary Companies Demand for software to record, archive messaging on the rise

Banks pay hundreds of millions of dollars in regulatory fines

Continued remote working underscores risk of compliance missteps















LONDON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Asset managers are tightening controls on personal communication tools such as WhatsApp as they join banks in trying to ensure employees play by the rules when they do business with clients remotely.

Regulators had already begun to clamp down on the use of unauthorised messaging tools to discuss potentially market-moving matters, but the issue gathered urgency when the pandemic forced more finance staff to work from home in 2020.

Most of the companies caught in communications and record-keeping probes by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have been banks - which have collectively been fined or have set aside more than $1 billion to cover regulatory penalties.

But fund firms with billions of dollars in assets are also increasing their scrutiny of how staff and clients interact.

""It is the hottest topic in the industry right now,"" said one deals banker, who declined to be named in keeping with his employer's rules on speaking to the media.

Reuters reported last year the SEC was looking into whether Wall Street banks had adequately documented employees' work-related communications, and JPMorgan was fined $200 million in December for ""widespread"" failures.

German asset manager DWS said last month it had set aside 12 million euros ($12 million) to cover potential U.S. fines linked to investigations into its employees' use of unapproved devices and record-keeping requirements, joining a host of banks making similar provisions, including Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse.

Sources at several other investment firms - described in the financial community as the 'buy-side' - including Amundi, AXA Investment Management, BNP Paribas Asset Management and JPMorgan Asset Management, told Reuters they have deployed tools to keep all communications between staff and clients compliant.

Spokespeople for the SEC and CFTC declined to comment on whether their investigations could extend beyond the banks, but industry sources expect authorities to cast their nets wider across the finance industry and even into government.

Last month Britain's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the country's top data protection watchdog, called for a review of the use of WhatsApp, private emails and other messaging apps by government officials after an investigation found ""inadequate data security"" during the pandemic.

GOOD BUSINESS FOR SOME

Regulations governing financial institutions have progressively been tightened since the global financial crisis of 2007-9 and companies have long recorded staff communications to and from office phones.

This practice is designed to deter and uncover infringements such as insider trading and ""front-running,"" or trading on information that is not yet public, as well as ensuring best practice in terms of treatment of customers.

But with thousands of finance workers and their clientele still working remotely after decamping from company offices at the start of the pandemic, some sensitive conversations that should be recorded remain at risk of being inadvertently held over informal or unauthorised channels.

Brad Levy, CEO of business messaging software firm Symphony, said concerns on managing that risk had driven a surge in interest for software upgrades that make conversations on popular messenging tools including Meta Platforms' WhatsApp recordable.

""Most believe the breadth of these investigations will go wider as they go deeper,"" Levy said.

""Many markets participants have retention and surveillance requirements so are likely to take a view, including being more proactive without being a direct target.""

He said Symphony's user base has more than doubled since the pandemic to 600,000, spanning 1,000 financial institutions including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.

Symphony peer Movius also said its business lines specialising in making WhatsApp and other tools recordable have more than doubled in size in the space of a year, with sales to asset managers a growing component.

""Many on the buy-side have recognised that you can't just rely on SMS and voice calls,"" said Movius Chief Executive Ananth Siva, adding that the company was also seeking to work with other highly-regulated industries including healthcare.

Movius software integrates third-party communications tools such as email, Zoom, Microsoft Teams and WhatsApp into one system that can be recorded and archived as required, he said.

Amundi, AXA IM, BNPP AM and JPMorgan Asset Management all confirmed they had adopted Symphony software but declined to comment on the full breadth of services they used or when these had been rolled out.

Amundi and AXA IM both confirmed they used Symphony services for team communications, while AXA IM also said they used it for market information.

Amundi, BNPP AM and JP Morgan AM declined to comment on whether they thought regulators would seek to investigate record keeping at asset managers after enforcement actions against the banks were completed.

A spokesperson for BNPP AM said it had banned the use of WhatsApp for client communications due to compliance, legal and risk considerations including General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

10-year U.S. Treasury yield nears 3%

Indexes: Dow down 0.9%, S&P 500 down 1.3%, Nasdaq down 2%















NEW YORK, Aug 19 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Friday in a broad selloff led by megacaps as U.S. bond yields rose, with the S&P 500 posting losses for the week after four straight weeks of gains.

Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) all fell and were the biggest drags on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.Higher rates tend to be a negative for tech and growth stocks, whose valuations rely more heavily on future cash flows.

U.S. Treasury yields rose, with the benchmark 10-year note nearly hitting 3%, after Germany reported record-high increases in monthly producer prices.

Investors have been weighing how aggressive the Federal Reserve may need to be as it raises interest rates to battle inflation.

Richmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin said on Friday that U.S. central bank officials have ""a lot of time still"" before they need to decide how large an interest rate increase to approve at their Sept. 20-21 policy meeting. read more

""The rise in rates around the globe and tough talk from central bankers are being used as an excuse to push stocks lower in very light volume on an August Friday session,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 292.3 points, or 0.86%, to 33,706.74, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 55.26 points, or 1.29%, to 4,228.48 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 260.13 points, or 2.01%, to 12,705.22.

All three major indexes registered losses for the week. The S&P 500 fell about 1.2% and the Nasdaq slid 2.6% in their first weekly declines after four weeks of gains. The Dow lost about 0.2% for the week.

After notching its worst first half since 1970, the S&P 500 has bounced some 16% from its mid-June low, fueled by stronger-than-expected corporate earnings and hopes the economy can avoid a recession even as the Fed hikes rates. read more

Friday's monthly options expiration should also make way for greater near-term stock market moves as options positions expire, said Brent Kochuba, founder of options-focused financial insights company SpotGamma.

The U.S. central bank needs to keep raising borrowing costs to tame decades-high inflation, a string of U.S. central bank officials said on Thursday, even as they debated how fast and how high to lift them.

The Fed has raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 225 basis points since March to fight inflation at a four decade-high.

Focus next week may be on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech on the economic outlook at the annual global central bankers' conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. read more

Shares of Deere & Co (DE.N) ended slightly higher, even after it lowered its full-year profit outlook and said it has sold out of large tractors as it grapples with parts shortages and high costs.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was last at 10.01 billion shares in one of the lowest volume days of the year.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 6.06-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.59-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

MELBOURNE, Aug 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Get ready to hear rafts of executives blame “drought”, “flood” and “natural disaster” for poor earnings in the next few months. On some levels, that’s understandable: large swathes of the Americas, Europe, Asia and Oceania have been suffering from either too little or too much water, and sometimes both in quick succession. But it’s also tired old language that obfuscates how such financial pain is a consequence of long allowing water risk to play second fiddle to greenhouse-gas emissions in battling climate change. Now DWS (DWSG.DE), Fidelity International, CalPERS and some 60 other investors with almost $10 trillion in assets between them are trying to change that.

The group has just launched the Valuing Water Finance Initiative after more than two years of constructing the scientific case for action. Despite its somewhat airy name, the VWFI will target 72 food, beverage, technology and apparel companies from Microsoft (MSFT.O) to McDonalds (MCD.N) to properly assess their exposure to the resource, as well as better manage and protect it. It’s modelled on the Climate Action 100+, a carbon-focused initiative led by 700 investors holding $68 trillion in assets; climate nonprofit organisation Ceres is a founding member of both.

It's not that water risk is completely ignored. A smaller Ceres-led investor campaign in the past targeted fast-food chains, while another nonprofit, CDP, has warned that the cost of ignoring water risks costs companies five times as much as dealing with them. Shareholders, too, are starting to take companies to task for downplaying the risks. Earlier this month, for example, more than 60% of independent shareholders backed an investor proposal calling on Tesla (TSLA.O) to develop a better water strategy. But such resolutions are rare and infrequent.

There are good examples of corporate water action to draw on, including strategies from AB InBev (ABI.BR), Coca-Cola (KO.N) and Intel (INTC.O); these range from making their plants water-efficient to helping their supply chains and the communities they operate in to be more water aware and secure. Some of these companies are on the VWFI’s initial target list – a smart move that should help more speedily develop best practices for the laggards. With recent global events showing yet again how the effects of the changing climate are felt most through water, it’s past time to pipe in a concerted investor solution.

CONTEXT NEWS

A group of 64 investment firms collectively managing almost $10 trillion in assets on Aug. 16 launched the Valuing Water Finance Initiative VWFI to push companies with a high water footprint to value the resource properly, to understand its potential to pose a financial risk and to adapt their strategy accordingly.

Among the 64 founding members of the VWFI are Fidelity International, Franklin Templeton, DWS, AustralianSuper and the California Public Employees’ Retirement System.

The group is initially targeting 72 companies in the food, beverage, apparel and technology sectors, including Coca Cola, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Adidas, Lululemon Athletica, Apple, Alphabet, Kraft Heinz and Unilever.

The initiative, which was spearheaded by U.S.-based climate nonprofit Ceres and the Government of the Netherlands, is based on six major targets for companies. These encompass: water quantity and quality; ecosystem protection; universal and equitable access to water and sanitation; proper board oversight; and ensuring policy lobbying is aligned with sustainable water resource management.

AMC tumbles as UK's Cineworld mulls bankruptcy filing

Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rises past 3%

Aug 22 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply lower on Monday as investors fretted about a U.S. Federal Reserve gathering later this week in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that is expected to reinforce a strong commitment by the central bank to stamp out inflation.

All 11 S&P 500 sector indexes declined, led lower by consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD), down 2.84%, followed by a 2.78% loss in information technology (.SPLRCT).

Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) dropped 4.6% and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) fell 3.6%, while Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) each lost more than 2% as the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to its highest since July 21.

Technology and other higher-growth stocks often fall when bond yields rise.

After a summer rally on Wall Street ended last week, the S&P 500 (.SPX) remains down about 13% so far in 2022, and the Nasdaq (.IXIC) is down more than 20%.

The CBOE Volatility index (.VIX), Wall Street's fear gauge, rose to 23.9, its highest in over two weeks.

Focus is on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech on Friday at the central banking conference in Jackson Hole for further cues on how aggressively the Fed is likely to be with future interest rate hikes.

""Powell is going to try to sound hawkish to tamp down inflationary expectations and tighten financial conditions. So that's most likely going to be a negative catalyst for the market,"" warned Jay Hatfield, chief investment officer at Infrastructure Capital Management in New York.

The Fed will probably raise interest rates by 50 basis points in September, according to economists polled by Reuters. read more

However, traders are split between a 50 bps hike and a 75 bps hike by the central bank after several policymakers recently pushed back against expectations of a dovish pivot and emphasized the Fed's commitment to fight against inflation. FEDWATCH

296,356,Microsoft,2022-08-22,Zoom cuts annual forecast as revenue growth hits record low,"













Aug 22 (Reuters) - Zoom Video Communications Inc (ZM.O) on Monday cut its annual profit and revenue forecasts as demand for the video-conferencing platform cools off from pandemic highs amid stiff competition from Microsoft (MSFT.O) Teams and Cisco (CSCO.O) WebEx.

Shares of the pandemic darling fell 7% in extended trade after it reported its slowest quarterly revenue growth on record at 8%, as people switched to in-person meetings from virtual conversations.

Finance chief Kelly Steckelberg told analysts the firm's online business was likely to decline by 7% to 8% in fiscal 2023.

Founded by a former Cisco executive, Zoom was a little-known company when the pandemic hit in early 2020, but posted triple-digit revenue growth at the peak of the crisis as people stuck at home took to video-conferencing to communicate.

Zoom now faces an uphill task of onboarding high-paying clients to sustain its growth, and has seen expenses rise as it shells out more dollars to attract customers which have been reining in spending amid high inflation.

Operating expenses grew 51% to $704 million in the three months to July.

The company forecast annual revenue between $4.39 billion and $4.40 billion, compared with its earlier outlook of $4.53 billion to $4.55 billion.

It now expects annual adjusted profit per share between $3.66 and $3.69, compared with $3.70 to $3.77 forecast earlier.

""Zoom remains a ""show-me"" story, where the company believes there's a lot of potential and higher growth ahead, but Wall Street clearly doesn't believe it yet,"" Rishi Jaluria, managing director of software at RBC Capital Markets said.

297,817,Microsoft,2022-08-23,Recession could be U.S. banks’ guilty pleasure,"













NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters Breakingviews) - When it comes to the possibility of a recession, some U.S. bank executives are saying the quiet part out loud. Not only would the largest lenders survive even a savage economic downturn, but they may emerge stronger from it.

Bank chiefs talk openly about a coming crunch, but don’t seem to fear it. Citigroup’s Jane Fraser said in July that banks depend on capital, liquidity, credit quality and reserves in a recession, and that she feels “very good about all four.” JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon, has warned of an economic “hurricane”, and told clients two weeks ago that there might be a 40%-plus chance of a hard recession or even “something worse”. Yet he also boasted in July that even when Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, his firm remained profitable.

This isn’t hubris. Big lenders are better prepared for a rough ride than they were before the last big financial crisis. That’s not entirely through choice: The Federal Reserve forces banks to hold capital sufficient to absorb colossal amounts of red ink. JPMorgan, for example, must be ready for a $41 billion loss. As of 2020 lenders also have to pre-emptively take charges against today’s profit to cover future estimated bad debts. That’s something they hate but which leaves them even more thickly padded.

Dimon and his peers have also done some economic cherry-picking in recent years. Risky second-home mortgages and leveraged loans are out; so-called prime customers are in. Under boss Brian Moynihan, Bank of America has cut its mortgage lending by roughly $130 billion since 2009, while lending an equivalent amount to clients of the bank’s wealth and investment management division. And lenders have shored up their liquidity, the lifeblood of a bank when markets seize up. Bank of America and Citi each had nearly $1 trillion of cash, and investments they could easily turn into cash, at the end of June.

Reality check: Bank stocks have tended to rise when U.S. Treasury yields do, until recently

It’s one thing to say big banks can survive a recession. What’s less loudly spoken about is the idea they can benefit from one. Some of their businesses are less exposed to the direction of the economy: Dealmaking may slow in hard times, but trading desks tend to do well when financial markets are volatile, on the way down as well as on the way up.

More importantly, a recession is likely to be more punishing for the young technology firms that are proving banks’ most troubling source of competition. Most digital-only banks and buy-now-pay-later services have yet to experience a downturn. Many need fresh capital, which becomes harder to raise as the economic picture deteriorates.

Besides, as Dimon points out, in a recession “certain things get cheaper”. This includes staff, whose pay is already falling sharply after taking account of inflation. An adjustment in the labor market could also help Wall Street firms looking to hire tech-savvy employees who can help build out their digital products and backstage technology. As big tech firms like Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O) lay off staff, banks become more attractive employers.

Potential takeover targets are getting cheaper too: Shares in online brokerage Robinhood Markets (HOOD.O), which competes with JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), have fallen nearly 50% this year. Privately held payment powerhouse Stripe has cut its internal valuation by 28%, the Wall Street Journal reported in July. Cashed-up banks may find a downturn gives them an opportunity to swoop.

Whether a recession is long, short, hard, soft or non-existent, banks are already priced for misery. Big lenders’ stocks are currently trading around 20% below share price targets set by research analysts, according to Morningstar. Though analysts tend to be overoptimistic, such that there is typically a small gap between their targets and where shares actually trade, the discount is now over half the 40% it reached during the recession of March 2020. At its widest in 2008, it was around 60%.

By another gauge too, investors are already being too harsh. Bank stocks tend to track the yield on U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds, in a broad reflection of the fact that when long-term interest rates go up, lenders make more money. That relationship has reversed for much of 2022. PNC Bank Chief Executive Bill Demchak told analysts last month that the fall in valuations is “just wildly wrong” even in a worst-case scenario, adding that a downturn would help banks recapture some kinds of business that had gone elsewhere.

What’s clear is that a few years from now, big banks like JPMorgan will still be around, while some of their most aggressive new rivals will not. And more likely than not, the U.S. economy will eventually recover from any downturn. So while a recession may be brutal for customers, employees and Americans in general, for banks it could be a gift in disguise.

CONTEXT NEWS

Wall Street banks are prepared for an economic downturn with both ample liquidity and capital, executives told analysts during the second-quarter earnings season.

Citigroup Chief Executive Jane Fraser said that her bank was ready for a variety of scenarios, adding that what matters to a lender in a recession is “capital, liquidity, credit quality and reserves – and we feel very good about all four of them.”

JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon told analysts that his bank “didn’t lose money” after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, adding that the Federal Reserve’s recent stress tests, which showed the bank losing $41 billion in a theoretical downturn, were unrealistic.

The industry wrote off just 0.1% of its loans in the second quarter, according to Jefferies analysts, unchanged from the previous three quarters and lower than a year earlier.

298,423,Microsoft,2022-08-24,"Salesforce cuts forecast on lower IT spending, forex hit","













Aug 24 (Reuters) - Salesforce Inc (CRM.N) on Wednesday cut its annual revenue and profit forecasts over ""measured"" spending from clients and a hit from a stronger dollar, sending its shares down 7% in extended trading.

Salesforce also announced stock repurchase of up to $10 billion, its first-ever buyback, while warning of challenges in North America and major European markets for some of its products.

The company's tempered expectations mark a significant change in its stance from May, when it had shrugged off any material impact from uncertain macroeconomic environment on its profit. read more

""We see customers becoming more measured in the way they buy. Sales cycles can get stretched ... we started seeing this in July,"" Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff said in a conference call.

Analysts had warned that macroeconomic factors such as inflation and slowing U.S. growth could hurt spending from small- and medium-sized businesses that use Salesforce products for managing customer relationships.

Cloud software companies with significant operations outside of the United States, including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Accenture Plc and IBM Corp (IBM.N), have all tempered their forecasts due to a stronger dollar.

The San Francisco, California-based company cut its revenue forecast to between $30.90 billion and $31.00 billion, below estimates of $31.73 billion as per IBES data from Refinitiv.

It also lowered the adjusted profit forecast to $4.71-$4.73.

CFRA analyst John Freeman said he expects the company's large size to help it withstand the hit from lower client spending, adding that the stock repurchase plan was unlikely to significantly impact shares, given no clarity on timeline and the exact quantum of the buyback.

Salesforce second-quarter results topped Wall Street expectations, with adjusted profit of $1.19 per share coming 17 cents higher than estimates, and revenue at $7.72 billion slightly ahead of estimates of $7.70 billion.

Summary Companies Price hikes in Europe, Japan, Britain

No hike in U.S. where PlayStation is battling Xbox

Strength of U.S. dollar squeezing business- analyst

Sony struggling to meet demand amid supply chain disruption















TOKYO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Sony Group Corp (6758.T) said on Thursday it was hiking the price of its PlayStation 5 games console in markets including Europe, Japan and Britain following economic pressures including rising interest rates.

Sony said it is raising the price of the disk drive equipped version of the console to 549.99 euros ($550.81) from 499.99 euros previously in Europe with a similar hike in Japan.

The Japanese entertainment conglomerate said there would be no price increase in the United States, where it is locked in battle with Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Xbox, which is aggressively expanding its games subscription service.

""We're seeing high global inflation rates, as well as adverse currency trends, impacting consumers and creating pressure on many industries,"" Sony Interactive Entertainment Chief Executive Jim Ryan wrote in a blog post.

The price hike comes as Sony's games business has been squeezed by supply chain snarls feeding into hardware shortages, with the conglomerate aiming to boost PS5 production for the year-end shopping season. read more

While the price hike ""is a necessity given the current global economic environment and its impact on SIE's business, our top priority continues to be improving the PS5 supply situation,"" gaming chief Ryan wrote.

Sony aims to sell 18 million units of the hit device in the current financial year after selling 11.5 million units in the year ended March.

""Although wide ranging, the PS5 price increases are relatively nuanced and are taking place in markets where the impact is being felt the most with an added layer of squeeze coming from the strength of the U.S. dollar,"" Ampere Analysis analyst Piers Harding-Rolls wrote in a blog post.

""Microsoft will take advantage of Sony's increase to push its 'value' message,"" Harding-Rolls added.

300,450,Microsoft,2022-08-25,Dell fans slowdown fears with weak revenue forecast,"













Aug 25 (Reuters) - Dell Technologies Inc (DELL.N) joined rivals in predicting a slowdown as runaway inflation and the darkening economic outlook prompt consumers and businesses to tighten their purse strings, sending its shares down 8% in extended trading on Thursday.

Industry majors from Intel Corp to Lenovo Group (0992.HK) have warned of a slump in the personal computer market after a two-year boom during the pandemic, with research firm Gartner estimating shipments would drop 9.5% in 2022.

While Dell's enterprise-focused business has somewhat made up for the PC slowdown, company executives were cautious about the outlook for the unit that generates nearly half its revenue.

""There's caution around future hiring, trade-offs within their IT budgets given the macroeconomic uncertainty, customers reducing the size of orders and buying for only immediate requirements,"" co-Chief Operating Officer Chuck Whitten said on a post-earnings call.

The company expects third-quarter revenue between $23.8 billion and $25 billion, below the $26.34 billion estimated by analysts, according to Refinitiv data.

Revenue growth in the second quarter was the slowest in more than one and a half years as the company also took a hit from a surge in the dollar and COVID-19 flare-ups in China - its second-largest market.

The stronger dollar has pressured earnings of technology companies from Microsoft Inc (MSFT.O) to Apple Inc (AAPL.O), and will likely continue to be a headache as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.

Consumer revenue declined 9%, but was somewhat offset by a 15% jump in the commercial business that benefited from businesses placing orders to gear up the hybrid-work era.

Infrastructure solutions group, home to the company's storage business, grew 12% to $9.5 billion.

Dell reported an adjusted profit of $1.68 per share on revenue of $26.43 billion, which was 9% higher.

Aug 25 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply higher on Thursday, lifted by gains in Nvidia and other technology-related stocks as investors focused on the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole conference for clues about the central bank's policy outlook.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is due to give a speech on Friday that investors will dissect for indications of how aggressively the Fed may move to raise interest rates as it battles decades-high inflation.

""We're in a period of time between the end of the second-quarter earnings season and meaningful additional data from the Federal Reserve. Markets are churning a bit with a reasonably low level of volatility,"" said Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.

The yield on the closely watched 10-year Treasury note faded after recently hitting a two-month high. Declining interest rates tend to benefit technology stocks trading at high valuations.

""Lower interest rates have certainly put some support underneath some of the more growth-oriented sectors,"" Northey said.

302,209,Microsoft,2022-08-26,"Amazon not expected to bid for Electronic Arts, says CNBC","













Aug 26 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is not expected to bid for Electronic Arts Inc (EA.O), CNBC said on Friday, citing sources, quashing an earlier report that the online giant would make an offer today for the videogame publisher.

EA shares jumped 15% in premarket trading after the report from USA Today on Amazon's takeover offer for the ""FIFA"" and ""Apex Legends"" owner. The stock was up 4% in early trading, giving the company a market valuation of over $37 billion.

Amazon and EA said they do not comment on rumors and M&A speculation.

Sitting on a cash pile of about $37 billion, Amazon has hit the acquisition trail to diversify its business beyond e-commerce and cloud under new Chief Executive Andy Jassy.

The company earlier this month offered to buy Roomba-maker iRobot Corp (IRBT.O) for $1.7 billion, just weeks after agreeing to acquire primary care provider One Medical (ONEM.O) for $3.5 billion.

Amazon, which owns videogame live-streaming platform Twitch, has also purchased MGM studios, the maker of ""Rocky"" and ""James Bond"", movies for $8.5 billion.

EA's strong licenses, intellectual property rights and the potential to build new games in the metaverse make it an attractive option for tech giants looking to grab attention from a younger audience, analysts said.

Bets on the metaverse had also powered Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) $68.7 billion deal for EA rival and ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) in January.

The new deals are also blurring the line between personal computer and mobile gaming companies and come against the backdrop of a struggling global gaming industry as the pandemic-fueled surge in demand ebbs.

The global gaming market is expected to grow just 2% in 2022 from a year ago, data from research firm Newzoo showed, a far cry from the 23% growth clocked in 2020.

EA has forecast lackluster adjusted sales numbers, saying it was not ""completely immune"" to recession. read more

303,362,Microsoft,2022-08-26,Netflix mulls $7-$9 per month for its ad-supported subscription - Bloomberg News,"













Aug 26 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) is looking to charge about $7 to $9 per month for its new advertising-supported subscription plan, Bloomberg news reported late on Friday.

The company plans to introduce its budget-friendly option in the final three months of the year across at least half a dozen geographies. However, the full rollout may have to wait until early next year, the report said.

It plans to sell around four minutes of commercials per hour for the ad-supported service, showing ads before and during the shows, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. (https://bloom.bg/3KpYa7s)

The streaming giant declined to comment on the report and its pricing plan.

Rival Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) had in March announced it will offer a cheaper, ad-supported version of its Disney+ streaming service later this year.

Netflix's goal is to attract subscribers who are ready to watch shows with advertisements, at almost half of its current price plan that costs $15.49 per month.

The plan for ad-supported subscription comes after it reported a loss of about 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter this year against the backdrop of rising inflation squeezing consumer spending.

""Those who have followed Netflix know that I've been against the complexity of advertising, and a big fan of the simplicity of subscription. But as much as I'm a fan of that, I'm a bigger fan of consumer choice,"" Chief executive Reed Hastings had said in April. read more

304,711,Microsoft,2022-08-26,Wall St Week Ahead U.S. summer stock rally at risk as September looms,"













NEW YORK, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The 10.7% rally in the S&P 500 (.SPX) from its June lows is stumbling as it runs into what has historically been the toughest month for the U.S. stock market, sparking nerves among some fund managers of a broad sell-off in September.

The S&P has been in a bear market since plummeting early this year as investors priced in the expectation of aggressive Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, but the index has rallied strongly since June, regaining half its losses for the year.

That rebound has been fueled by a combination of strong earnings from bellwether companies and signs that inflation might have peaked, potentially allowing the Fed to slow rate hikes. read more

But as investors and traders return from summer holidays, some are nervous about a bumpier ride in September, due to seasonal concerns and nervousness about the Fed's pace of hikes and theireconomic impact.

The S&P 500 fell nearly 3.4% Friday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank's commitment to taming inflation despite a possible recession. read more

""These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain,"" Powell said in a closely watched speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

September typically is a down month for the stock market because fund managers tend to sell underperforming positions as the end of the third quarter approaches, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac.

""We've had a breathtaking run and I wouldn't be shocked if the market takes a hit here,"" said Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Management Solutions.

The S&P 500 could fall as much as 10% in September as investors price in the likelihood that the Fed will not start to cut rates as early as some had hoped, Janasiewicz said.

September has been the worst month for the S&P 500 since 1945, with the index advancing only 44% of the time, the least of any month, according to CFRA data. The S&P 500 has posted an average loss of 0.6% in September, the worst for any month.

The index is down 14.8% year to date and has been in a bear market, hitting its lowest level in June since December 2020 after the Fed announced its largest rate hike since 1994.

Chief among the reasons for the gloomy outlook is a belief that the Fed will continue hiking rates and keep them above neutral longer than markets had anticipated as recently as a week ago, weighing on consumer demand and the housing market.

Nearly half of market participants now expect the Fed funds rate to end the year above 3.7% by the end of the year, up from 40% a week ago, according to the CME FedWatch tool. /FEDWATCH The fed funds rate is currently between 2.25 and 2.5%.

The Sept. 20-21 FOMC meeting will also likely drive volatility during the month, prompting the S&P 500 to fall near its June lows, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Ahead of that will be critical economic data, such as a reading on consumer prices that will give investors more insight into whether inflation has peaked.

The strong rally since June, however, suggests the index will continue to rebound through December, Stovall said.

""While we might end up retesting the June low, history says that we will not set a new low,"" he said.

While fund managers as a whole remain bearish, the ratio of bulls to bears has improved since July, reducing the likelihood of outsized gains in the months ahead, according to Bank of America survey released Aug. 16. The bank's clients were net sellers of U.S. equities last week for the first time in eight weeks, suggesting that investors are growing more defensive, the bank said.

At the same time, the use of leverage by hedge funds - a proxy for their willingness to take risk - has stabilized since June and is near the lowest level since March 2020, according to Goldman Sachs.

Investors may rotate into technology and other growth stocks that can take market share despite an economic slowdown, said Tiffany Wade, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, who is overweight mega-cap stocks like Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp(MSFT.O).

""We expect the pullback will start with some of the riskier names that have run up a lot since June,"" she said.

Energy shares climb on crude jump

Bristol Myers Squibb slumps on drug trial data

Dow down 0.57%, S&P 500 down 0.67%, Nasdaq down 1.02%















NEW YORK, Aug 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed lower on Monday, adding to last week's sharp losses on nagging concerns about the Federal Reserve's determination to aggressively hike interest rates to fight inflation even as the economy slows.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Friday the U.S. economy would need tight monetary policy ""for some time"" before inflation is under control, dashing hopes the Fed might pivot to more subdued rate hikes after recent data suggested price pressures were peaking.

The S&P 500 recovered from session lows that put it down 1% at the lowest in a month, but the benchmark index still notched its biggest two-day percentage decline in 2-1/2 months.

""Friday’s selloff was frankly overdone, I know (Powell) said he was going to play tough with inflation but it is honestly not that much different than what he has been saying for the last several weeks, he was a little more hawkish but I mean, geez, who is surprised by that, really?"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.

""I don’t see a whole lot of up or downside here in the near term, I see a lot of volatility and that is probably going to be the case at the very least until we get past the September 21 rate hike.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 184.41 points, or 0.57%, to 32,098.99, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 27.05 points, or 0.67%, to 4,030.61 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 124.04 points, or 1.02%, to 12,017.67.

Megacap technology and growth stocks such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O), off 1.37%, and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), down 1.07% were among the biggest drags on the index as Treasury yields rose.

The CBOE's volatility index (.VIX), Wall Street's fear gauge, hit a seven-week high of 27.67 points.

Money market traders are pricing in a 72.5% chance of a 75-basis-point interest rate hike at the Fed's September meeting, which would be the third straight hike of that magnitude. They expect the Fed funds rate to end the year at about 3.7%.

The two-year Treasury yield , which is particularly sensitive to interest rate expectations, briefly touched a 15-year high, while the closely watched yield curve measured by the gap between two and 10-year yields remained firmly inverted.

An inversion is considered by many to be a reliable signal of a looming recession.

Economic data this week is highlighted by the August nonfarm payrolls report due on Friday. Any signs of a slowdown in the labor market might take pressure off the Fed to continue with outsized rate hikes.

The S&P 500 climbed nearly 11% since mid-June through Friday's close. It recently found support just above its 50-day moving average, although it remains well below its 200-day moving average. Despite the rebound, some investors remain worried as September approaches due to the historical weakness for stocks during the month and the anticipated hike from the Fed.

Energy stocks (.SPNY), up 1.54% were a bright spot as crude prices jumped about 4% on possible OPEC+ output cuts and conflict in Libya. read more

Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY.N) slid 6.24% after its drug candidate for preventing ischemia strokes missed the main goal in a mid-stage trial.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.36 billion shares, compared with the 10.59 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.19-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.20-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 2 new 52-week highs and 22 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 28 new highs and 199 new lows.

BRUSSELS, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Amended licensing deals and other changes making it easier for cloud service providers to compete will take effect on Oct. 1, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Monday, a move triggered by complaints about the U.S. software company to EU antitrust regulators.

Microsoft President Brad Smith had announced the changes in May but did not say when they would be effective. read more

The company, which has been fined 1.6 billion euros ($1.6 billion) by the European Commission in the previous decade for various infringements, found itself once again in the EU's crosshairs following complaints by cloud service providers in Germany, Italy, Denmark and France.

""On October 1, 2022, Microsoft will implement significant upgrades to our outsourcing and hosting terms that will benefit customers worldwide,"" the company said in a blogpost.

The revised licensing deals mean customers can use their licenses on any European cloud provider delivering services to their own data centers.

Rivals Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google, Alibaba (9988.HK) and Microsoft's own cloud services will be excluded from the deals.

Customers also will be allowed to buy licenses just for the virtual environment without the need to buy the physical hardware.

The EU competition watchdog has yet to comment on Microsoft's proposals.

307,320,Microsoft,2022-08-30,Netflix hires two top ad executives from Snap,"













Aug 30 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) lured two of Snap Inc's (SNAP.N) top executives to lead its advertising sales team, the company announced Tuesday, poaching two people that lent the social media company credibility with brand marketers.

Netflix confirmed it hired Snap's chief business officer, Jeremi Gorman, as its new president of worldwide advertising. It also brought in Snap's vice president of ad sales, Peter Naylor, in the same role at the streaming service.

The hiring of these two veterans signals Netflix's commitment to building an ad-supported version of the company's streaming service, which is expected to launch next year.

""You have two executives that are incredibly well positioned to help Netflix move quickly,"" said LightShed Partners partner Rich Greenfield. ""They have incredible relationships with brands and advertisers who will want to advertise on Netflix.""

Gorman is a well-respected executive who previously spent six years at Amazon.com (AMZN.O). She arrived at Snap in 2018, at a time when the service was losing executives. Her arrival was seen as bringing credibility to Snap's ad-sales business.

Naylor served as Hulu's senior vice president of ad sales for six years before joining Snap in 2020. He attempted to help Snap capture more television ad dollars.

Snap confirmed the executive departures but declined to comment further.

Netflix has been assembling the pieces to launch a less-expensive version of its streaming service with commercials. In July, it announced a partnership with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to provide ad technology. The new executives will bring established relationships with advertisers looking to advertise on Netflix.

""It sends a message that Netflix is really serious about building an ad business quickly,"" Greenfield said.

BRUSSELS, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Amazon (AMZN.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google criticised Microsoft's (MSFT.O) cloud computing changes on Tuesday, saying they limit competition and discourage customers from switching to rival cloud service providers.

The U.S. software giant on Monday announced amended licensing deals and other changes that will take effect on Oct. 1 and which they say will make it easier for cloud service providers to compete. read more

Amazon, Google, Alibaba (9988.HK) and Microsoft's own cloud services will be excluded from the deals.

Microsoft's move came after smaller European Union competitors took their grievances about its cloud service practices to EU antitrust regulators, which subsequently quizzed market players on the issue and what impact they have experienced.

Amazon, the leading cloud service provider trailed by Microsoft and Google, was scathing in its critiques.

""Microsoft is now doubling-down on the same harmful practices by implementing even more restrictions in an unfair attempt to limit the competition it faces – rather than listening to its customers and restoring fair software licensing in the cloud for everyone,"" a spokesperson for its cloud service unit AWS said in an email.

Google's vice president for government affairs and policy Google Cloud Marcus Jadotte was equally critical.

""The promise of the cloud is flexible, elastic computing without contractual lock-ins,"" he said in a tweet.

""Customers should be able to move freely across platforms and choose the technology that works best for them, rather than what works best for Microsoft,"" Jadotte said.

SYDNEY, Aug 30 (Reuters) - An Australian regulator sent legal letters to Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) demanding they share their strategies for stamping out child abuse material on their platforms or face fines.

The e-Safety Commissioner, a body set up to protect internet users, said it used laws which took effect in January to compel the technology giants to disclose measures they were taking to detect and remove abuse material within 28 days. If they did not, the companies would each face a fine of A$555,000 ($383,000) per day.

The threat underscores Australia's hardline approach to regulating Big Tech firms since 2021 which has so far included laws forcing them to pay media outlets for displaying their content and laws making them hand over details of anonymous accounts which post defamatory material.

The internet firms have meanwhile been under pressure around the world to find a way to monitor encrypted messaging and streaming services for child abuse material without encroaching on user privacy. read more

""This activity is no longer confined to hidden corners of the dark web but is prevalent on the mainstream platforms we and our children use every day,"" said commissioner Julie Inman Grant in a statement.

""As more companies move towards encrypted messaging services and deploy features like livestreaming, the fear is that this horrific material will spread unchecked on these platforms,"" she added.

A spokeperson for Microsoft, which owns video calling service Skype, said the company had received the letter and planned to respond within 28 days.

A spokesperson for Meta, which also owns messaging service WhatsApp, said the company was still reviewing the letter but continued to ""proactively engage with the eSafety Commissioner on these important issues"".

Apple, which owns video messaging service FaceTime, messaging service iMessage and photo storing service iCloud, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

The eSafety Commissioner referred to figures provided by the U.S. National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, which said this year it had received 29.1 million reports of child abuse material from internet companies, of which just 160 were from Apple while 22 million were from Facebook.

Summary Companies UK to further probe Microsoft-Activision merger

Deal could reduce gaming console competition

Microsoft, Activision to cooperate with CMA















LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Britain's antitrust regulator said Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) $69 billion acquisition of ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard could harm competition in gaming consoles, subscription services and cloud gaming, and it needs to be investigated in depth.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Thursday the deal, the largest ever in gaming, could damage the industry if Microsoft refused to give competitors access to Activision's best-selling games.

""We are concerned that Microsoft could use its control over popular games like 'Call of Duty' and 'World of Warcraft' post-merger to harm rivals, including recent and future rivals in multi-game subscription services and cloud gaming,"" the CMA said.

Microsoft, with Xbox, and its rivals Sony (6758.T) and Nintendo (7974.T) have led the console market for 20 years, with limited entries from new rivals, the CMA said.

""We want people to have more access to games, not less,"" Microsoft President and Vice Chair Brad Smith said.

""Sony, as the industry leader, says it is worried about 'Call of Duty', but we've said we are committed to making the same game available on the same day on both Xbox and PlayStation,"" he said.

Several analysts described the move as unsurprising and said that the deal would not be anti-competitive if competitors were given access to Microsoft games, as Microsoft has pledged.

Microsoft needs to give a greater deal on assurances and put down in writing certain specifics around exclusivity, said Atlantic Equities analyst Kunaal Malde.

Activision still expects the deal to close in Microsoft's financial year to end-June 2023. The companies have until Sept. 8 to submit proposals to address the CMA's concerns.

Shares in Microsoft were down 1.2%.

CLOUD GAMES

The deal, which was announced in January, will require approval in the United States as well as other major jurisdictions including the European Union and China.

Reuters previously reported that Microsoft would pay a $3 billion break-fee if the deal falls through, according to a source familiar with the matter, suggesting the company was confident of winning antitrust approval. read more

The CMA said Microsoft was well positioned to succeed in cloud gaming, given it had a leading cloud platform in Azure and the leading PC operating system in Windows OS, as well as Xbox.

It said these strengths in combination with Activision's games could damage competition in the nascent market for cloud gaming services.

Microsoft said in a blog on Thursday that it would launch major Activision games on its Game Pass subscription service and also make them available to other consoles and mobile devices through cloud game streaming technology.

Summary Law firms

Law firms Related documents Heirs said tech companies sold 'bootleg' versions of music

Amazon, Google, Microsoft also previously sued















(Reuters) - Apple Inc has settled a copyright dispute with the heirs of the songwriters behind ""Get Happy,"" ""Stormy Weather,"" ""That's Amore"" and other hits from the Tin Pan Alley music era of the early 20th century, according to Wednesday filings in San Francisco federal court.

The settlement marks the end of a series of lawsuits against Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft for allegedly selling ""bootleg"" digital versions of those and other songs written by Harold Arlen, Harry Warren and Ray Henderson.

The heirs' attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday, and neither did Apple or one of its attorneys.

Arlen is best known for writing ""Over the Rainbow"" and other popular songs from the early 1900s, including ""I've Got the World on a String"" and ""The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea."" Henderson wrote standards including ""Bye Bye Blackbird,"" and Warren's best-known songs include ""At Last"" and ""I Only Have Eyes for You.""

Beginning in 2019, the heirs accused the tech companies of selling pirated recordings of dozens of songs. The lawsuits said the companies offered song downloads from entities that were ""simply duplicating previously released recordings and selling them as if they were the rightful owner"" for lower prices than authorized versions.

U.S. District Judge William Orrick said in March that Apple did not infringe the heirs' copyrights willfully, but may be liable for making the recordings available on the iTunes Store.

The parties reached a settlement on Wednesday, according to an entry on the court docket. The heirs settled their disputes with Amazon, Microsoft and Google last year.

The cases are SA Music LLC v. Apple Inc, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Nos. 3:20-cv-02146, 3:20-cv-02794 and 3:20-cv-02965.

LONDON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Britain's competition regulator finally cleared NortonLifeLock's (NLOK.O) acquisition of British rival Avast (AVST.L)on Friday, saying the security software market would remain competitive after the $8.6 billion merger of two of the biggest players.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) confirmed its provisional decision to allow the deal last month, removing the last major hurdle after it had received the green light in the United States, Spain and Germany. read more

The CMA said the merged company would face significant competition from McAfee and other smaller players, while software titan Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) security software was now as good as that offered by specialist providers.

NortonLifeLock said after the provisional decision that it expected to close the deal this month.

314,136,Microsoft,2022-09-02,Self-driving tech firm Aurora mulls sale to Apple or Microsoft - Bloomberg News,"













Sept 2 (Reuters) - Aurora Innovation Inc (AUR.O) Chief Executive Chris Urmson recently outlined several options for the self-driving tech firm to combat challenging market conditions, including a possible sale to Apple Inc (AAPL.O) or Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Bloomberg News reported on Friday.

Many electric-vehicle and self-driving startups that had raised cash easily through IPOs and mergers with blank-check firms during the market boom are now scrambling to launch vehicles and burning cash rapidly amid a bleak economy and supply-chain snarls.

Reuters reported in 2020 that Apple was moving forward with its self-driving car technology and was targeting 2024 to produce a passenger vehicle that could include its own breakthrough battery technology.

Microsoft, on the other hand, has invested in San Francisco-based self-driving car maker Cruise, which is valued at $30 billion and counts General Motors Co (GM.N) as a majority stakeholder.

Urmson, who co-founded Aurora after running Google owner Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) self-driving car project, also floated measures including cost cuts, taking the company private and spinning off or selling assets, the report said, citing an internal memo. (https://bloom.bg/3ReFDgP)

Aurora declined to comment.

Shares of the company closed 15% higher on Friday, but have lost nearly 80% this year, in a sign of its struggles since going public late last year with a blank-check firm. It has a market cap of about $2.4 billion.

Last month, Aurora said it would delay the delivery of its scalable autonomous freight trucks by a year to the first half of 2024, citing supply constraints.

Other options Urmson suggested in the memo were to buy companies in the sector with $150 million to $300 million of cash, and to freeze hiring and lay off employees, the Bloomberg report said.

315,787,Microsoft,2022-09-06,China-focused hedge funds lower exposure as risks mount,"













HONG KONG, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Some of Asia's large China-focused hedge funds are buying more non-China stocks as regulatory scrutiny, policy uncertainties and a slowing mainland economy force them to cut exposure to offshore Chinese assets.

Beijing's clampdown on technology companies, a real estate debt crisis, Sino-U.S. audit tensions and disruptions from zero-COVID policies, have hit sentiment, portfolio managers said, adding it was difficult to see how companies would grow.

""The past year has been extremely difficult for funds that are based in Hong Kong and focusing on investing in offshore China stocks,"" said a Hong Kong-based hedge fund portfolio manager, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the subject.

""Many have had to cut exposure to China stocks and allocate some positions to the U.S. or Southeast Asia.""

Hedge funds are aggressive users of leverage and derivatives to generate yields. China-focused funds have traditionally kept a large portion of portfolios in American Depository Receipts (ADRs) of mainland firms.

HHLR Advisers, an investment management firm under private equity firm Hillhouse Capital Group, had three non-China companies in its top five U.S.-listed holdings in the second quarter compared with just one in the second quarter of 2021, 13F filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission show.

HHLR is one of the largest offshore China managers and known for its heavy positions in U.S.-listed Chinese stocks. Its three top non-China holdings are customer relationship management platform provider Salesforce, food delivery firm DoorDash and gaming and e-commerce company Sea. Its top holding, comprising 19% of its portfolio in U.S.-listed stocks, is Chinese drug developer BeiGene

Hong Kong-based Aspex Management which manages more than $7 billion and focuses on pan-Asian equity, backed by Hillhouse Founder Zhang Lei, has also switched holdings. Four out of five of Aspex's top buys among U.S.-listed firms in the second quarter were non-China names, including DoorDash, semiconductor equipment supplier Lam Research, NVidia and Las Vegas Sands.

Its non-China exposure now accounts for about 31% of its top 10 U.S.-listed holdings, a significant increase from about 15% in the first quarter of 2022, or 14% in the same period last year, based on Reuters calculations according to 13F filings.

The China ADR index is down more than 60% from a peak on Feb. 16 2021, far more than Nasdaq's 17% drop for the same period.

ECONOMIC, REGULATORY RISKS

Hong Kong-based Tairen Capital,a hedge fund which invests globally with a China focus, reported four out of five top buys in the second quarter were non-China names, while eight out its top 10 U.S.-listed holdings were non-Chinese companies, according to 13F filings.

Tairen was once among top investors in China's e-commerce platform Pinduoduo. In the second quarter of 2021, the firm's largest U.S. stock listing position was Pinduoduo with a market value of over $200 million, but as they shed that stock over the next two quarters, the fund's largest position in the most recent quarter was Microsoft.

Many China-focused funds have been hiring analysts with experience in U.S. markets.

In a letter to investors in April, reviewed by Reuters, Hong Kong-based Anatole Investment CIO George Yang said the firm would deploy more capital to the United States, where they can find ""opportunities with long duration and therefore great beta"". That came after the fund posted the worst quarterly result since they launched in 2016 in the first quarter.

The trend of increasing exposure to non-China stocks is unlikely to be a short-term trend to hedge China risk, said a Hong Kong-based equity sales director focused on the technology, media and telecom sector.

However, some investors doubt this is a sustainable way to hedge risks particularly for funds that had posted disappointing returns in their home market.

Damien Tan, managing director at Cambridge Associates believes the non-China exposure will not represent a major part of the portfolio, especially for China-focused managers, as these managers need to ""demonstrate how they have a competitive edge to underwrite and research these non-China names"".

Pierre Hoebrechts, CIO at Hong Kong-based Arowana Asset Management who has been investing in China for 12 years, said most China funds had faced challenges picking stocks in their market of expertise in the past 18 months, and hence there were fair doubts about their ability to navigate a market where they have little long-term experience.

He also pointed to the substantial difference in valuations between China and the United States in many sectors, following the very large correction the Chinese market has suffered.

""Investors might wonder to which extent that market might actually have many more opportunities than the U.S. at this stage.""

NEW YORK, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes closed lower on Tuesday, the first session after the U.S. Labor Day holiday and summer vacations, as traders assessed fresh economic data in volatile trading.

A survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) showed the U.S. services industry picked up in August for the second straight month amid stronger order growth and employment, while supply bottlenecks and price pressures eased. read more

However, numbers from S&P Global showed the services sector Purchasing Managers' Index fell short of flash estimates for August.

A stronger-than-expected reading on the U.S. services sector fueled expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates to tame inflation.

""The Fed has relegated us to being very data dependent, so every piece of information that comes out investors are going to look not only at the absolute level, but try to infer what that means for when the Fed meets,"" said Carol Schleif, deputy chief investment officer at BMO Family Office.

""One of the things that is disconcerting to investors is that there's really little to propel markets either up solidly or down solidly,"" she added.

Concerns over the supply of energy to Europe and how COVID-19 lockdowns will impact China's economy also drove markets down on Tuesday, said Shawn Cruz, head trading strategist at TD Ameritrade. ""A lot of uncertainty and volatility is not coming from the U.S.; it's actually coming from overseas.""

The tech-heavy Nasdaq (.IXIC) suffered its seventh consecutive day of losses, its longest losing streak since November 2016.

Rate-sensitive shares of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) fell about 1% as benchmark U.S. Treasury yields rose to their highest levels since June. Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which will launch new iPhones next Wednesday, lost 0.8.

Traders see a 74% chance of a third consecutive 75-basis-point rate hike at the Fed's policy meeting later this month, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.

The focus will be on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech on Thursday as well U.S. consumer price data next week for clues on the path of monetary policy.

Markets started September on a weak note, extending a slide that started at the end of August, as hawkish comments from Fed policymakers and data signaling U.S. economicmomentum raised fears of aggressive interest rate hikes.

The S&P is down nearly 18% so far this year, while the Nasdaq has shed over 26% as rising interest rates hurt megacap technology and growth stocks.

Among the major S&P sectors, energy (.SPNY) and communication services (.SPLRCL) were the worst performers, while defensive utilities (.SPLRCU) and real estate (.SPLRCR) rose.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 173.14 points, or 0.55%, to 31,145.3; the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 16.07 points, or 0.41%, to 3,908.19; and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 85.96 points, or 0.74%, to 11,544.91.

Sept 7 (Reuters) - (In Sept 7 story, corrects headline to note biggest pct gain in four weeks, not four-week high)

U.S. stock indexes climbed the most in roughly a month as bond yields eased, with investors shrugging off hawkish remarks made by Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday.

The last time the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC), S&P 500 (.SPX) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) reached a higher one-day percentage jump was on Aug 10, although investors doubt this is a long-lasting trend.

The technology-heavy Nasdaq led gains among the main indexes, snapping a seven-session losing streak.

U.S. stocks have sold off sharply since mid-August after hawkish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell were compounded by signs of an economic slowdown in Europe and China and aggressive steps by major central banks to tame inflation.

Data signaling strength in the U.S. economy has prompted traders to bet on a 75-basis-point interest rate hike by the Fed later this month. Fed fund futures implied investors were pricing in a more than 76% chance of such a move.

The 10-year Treasury yield slipped from three-month highs hit earlier in the session, boosting shares of rate-sensitive stocks such as Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).

High-growth companies such as those in the tech sector tend to benefit when yields go down as it means a lower discount rate on their future profits when investors are calculating valuations.

Still, investors are looking for more outward signs of how Federal Reserve rate hikes will unfold to tame a surging inflation before its next meeting later this month.

""The bond markets behaving a little bit better today which is giving the stock market a little bit of a better feeling, but the big worries are still what the Fed is going to do on Sep 21. So we're seeing a back and forth tug-of-war each day,"" said Brent Schutte, Chief Investment Officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company.

Stocks' performance also ignored hawkish comments by Federal Reserve earlier on Wednesday. Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester said the high cost of U.S. rental accommodation has not yet fully filtered through to inflation measures, suggesting inflation may still rise further. read more

Meanwhile, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said the U.S. central bank must lift interest rates to a level that restrains economic activity and keep them there until policymakers are ""convinced"" that inflation is subsiding, while Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard added the monetary policy will need to be restrictive ""for some time.""

The main focus will be on Powell's speech on Thursday and U.S. consumer price data next week for clues on the path of monetary policy.

The Fed's ""Beige Book"", a periodic snapshot of the health of the U.S. economy, indicated that price pressures are expected to persist at least through the end of the year.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 435.98 points, or 1.4%, to 31,581.28, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 71.68 points, or 1.83%, to 3,979.87 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 246.99 points, or 2.14%, to 11,791.90.

Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors were trading higher, led by a jump in utilities (.SPLRCU), reflecting the defensive positioning by investors due to economic uncertainties.

The energy index (.SPNY) fell 1.16% as oil prices tumbled about 5% on demand worries related to looming recession risks. Brent crude fell below $90 a barrel. read more

Nio Inc reversed earlier losses and ended the session up 2.16% after the Chinese electric vehicle maker reported a bigger second-quarter adjusted net loss but revenue topped expectations.

TOKYO, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Sony Group Corp's (6758.T) gaming chief Jim Ryan has called an offer by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to keep the ""Call of Duty"" series on PlayStation for a limited time ""inadequate"".

Xbox maker Microsoft announced the $69 billion acquisition of ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) in January and has pledged to keep the hit franchise on PlayStation beyond the existing agreement with Activision.

Microsoft ""has only offered for 'Call of Duty' to remain on PlayStation for three years after the current agreement,"" Ryan said in a statement.

""Their proposal was inadequate on many levels and failed to take account of the impact on our gamers,"" Ryan said.

The airing of private negotiation comes as Microsoft and Sony move to secure their games pipeline with a flurry of deals as advances in technology threaten the dominant position of platform operators.

The Activision Blizzard acquisition could damage the industry if Microsoft refused to give rivals access to Activision's best-selling games, Britain's antitrust regulator said last week. read more

WASHINGTON, Sept 9 (Reuters) - The United States imposed sanctions on Friday on Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and its minister, accusing them of being tied to a disruptive July cyberattack on Albania and engaging in other cyber activities against the United States and its allies.

The move comes after Albania severed diplomatic relations with Iran on Wednesday for the incident, ordering Iranian diplomats and embassy staff to leave within 24 hours. read more

The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement that Iran's Ministry of Intelligence directs several networks of cyber threat actors, including those involved in cyber espionage and ransomware attacks in support of the Iranian government.

""We will not tolerate Iran’s increasingly aggressive cyber activities,"" Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson said in the statement.

The ministry was already designated under U.S. sanctions.

Iran has disregarded ""norms of responsible peacetime state behavior in cyberspace,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken added in a statement.

Iran rejected the sanctions as ineffective and politically motivated.

""Like previous illegal U.S. sanctions against the Ministry of Intelligence, this new label will never be able to create the slightest hinder in the determination of the Iranian people's security servicemen in this proud institution,"" Iran's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said.

""The announcement of immediate U.S. support for the Albanian government's false accusation against Iran... clearly shows that it is the U.S. government that has designed this scenario against Iran,"" Iranian state media quoted Kanaani as saying.

Microsoft, whose cybersecurity research team helped investigate the incident, said in a blog post on Thursday that the Iranian cyber operation involved a combination of digital espionage techniques, data wiping malware and online information operations. The goal of the hackers, according to researchers, appeared to be to embarrass Albanian government officials.

The July attacks temporarily disrupted government websites and other public services. Analysts say the operation was intended to punish Albania for supporting an Iranian dissident group based in the country, known as the Mujahedin-e Khalq.

320,566,Microsoft,2022-09-09,EU to consult on making Big Tech contribute to telco network costs,"













PARIS/BRUSSELS, Sept 9 (Reuters) - The European Union's executive body will launch a consultation early next year on whether tech giants should bear some of the costs of Europe's telecoms network, EU industry chief Thierry Breton said on Friday.

Europe's telecoms operators have long lobbied for a financial contribution from U.S. tech firm's such as Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O), Meta's Facebook and Netflix (NFLX.O), saying that they use a huge part of the internet traffic.

""We also need to review whether the regulation is adapted with the 'GAFAs' (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon) for example, which use bandwidth (provided by) telecom operators,"" Breton told reporters, speaking in French.

GAFA is the French acronym to designate the biggest U.S. tech firms, including Netflix.

Breton said that this particular issue, or so-called potential ""fair share"" of U.S. tech companies in the financing of the European telecoms and internet infrastructure, will be part of a wide consultation that will entail metaverse -- the shared virtual world environments which people can access via the internet.

ETNO, Europe's lobby for telecoms operators, said in a report in May that more than half of the global network traffic is attributable to six firms: Google, Facebook, Netflix, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.

These firms have argued that the introduction of any new financial contribution would challenge ""net neutrality"", or the principle that internet service providers should enable access to all content and applications regardless of their source.

Internet providers, on their part, have said these companies have conflicting interests by providing competitive services such as voice services and TV and by exploiting their network, acting as free riders.

Breton said the consultation would be launched in the first quarter of 2023 and take five to six months. The EU Commission's proposals will follow, he said.

Nine lawmakers at the European Parliament have drafted a letter to be sent to Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen, Breton and EU digital chief Margrethe Vestager urging them to ensure that companies generating the largest traffic on network infrastructure should contribute in a fair and proportionate manner to the costs.

The lawmakers, who include Andreas Schwab, Stephanie Yon-Courtin and Paul Tang, also said new measures should be consistent with the principles of the Open Internet Regulation, referring to the bloc's net neutrality rules ensuring that internet service providers (ISPs) can't block or throttle traffic to give priority to some services.

""This fairer contribution should not be discriminatory against specific companies, but reflect the role and impact of those generating the most traffic in the network,"" they said in the letter seen by Reuters.

321,640,Microsoft,2022-09-12,Big Tech has its moment to take on Lina Khan,"













NEW YORK, Sept 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - A litigation setback for Federal Trade Commission trustbusters shows the thin legal ice on which antitrust hardliners like agency boss Lina Khan tread. Procedural hurdles to dealmaking introduced under her tenure appropriately discourage some mergers. But technology giants with the resources to wage court battles have an opening, now with extra legal precedent, to push back.

An agency-appointed judge's ruling in favor of medical technology companies Illumina (ILMN.O) and Grail (GRAL.O) marks the FTC’s first major loss under Khan. The FTC sued to unwind their $7 billion merger shortly before she was appointed chair in 2021, part of a clampdown on consolidation under the Biden administration that ramped up after she took over.

Under Khan, the FTC expanded deal investigations, stopped putting uncontroversial approvals on a fast-track, and expanded its reach by selectively screening future transactions outside of the normal process read more . These hurdles increase the cost of deals, so transactions without a compelling case no longer make sense. Meanwhile, deals raising bipartisan antitrust bugbears are more verboten than ever.

Yet U.S. dealmaking totaled $2.6 trillion in 2021, per Refinitiv – a record. Big tech firms are buying into adjacent markets: Microsoft (MSFT.O) agreed to buy Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) for $69 billion; Amazon.com (AMZN.O) acquired MGM for $8.5 billion. So Khan is rewriting the antitrust playbook to target tech deals that are harder to block under traditional rubric read more .

The problem, as the FTC found out in court, is convincing judges of these novel theories if buyers litigate. Despite launching its lawsuit on a bipartisan vote, the FTC’s case stretched the bounds of normal antitrust arguments. Khan’s next targets – like a recent lawsuit against Meta Platform’s (META.O) acquisition of virtual reality app developer Within – push even further, implying an even tougher battle.

Seeing this potential weakness, buyers looking to buck a crackdown have reason to stand their ground in court – as Meta is doing. And as the stakes increase, the possibility that a lawsuit will spiral into appeals, possibly all the way to the Supreme Court, rises.

If that happens, fundamental questions of antitrust practice that have largely been uncontested, like the FTC’s analytical methods, could be challenged. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, part of the court’s conservative majority, has expressed antitrust skepticism. Khan says there are benefits to fighting cases the agency might lose. But if courts establish legal precedent limiting the agency’s power, both she and her successors will bear that burden for years to come.

CONTEXT NEWS

The Federal Trade Commission on Sept. 2 said that it would appeal a decision by an administrative law judge to allow gene-sequencing company Illumina to acquire cancer detection test maker Grail. The FTC had sued to force the companies to unwind their $7 billion merger.

The European Commission, which was also investigating the transaction, said on Sept. 6 that it had decided to prohibit the merger. In response, Illumina said it would appeal the decision.

322,580,Microsoft,2022-09-12,French cloud provider OVH lines up diesel generators to offset potential power cuts,"Summary

Summary Companies Biggest France-home grown cloud operator braces for energy cuts

Considered as vital infrastructure by French gov

Questions remain on durability of alternative power supply















STRASBOURG, France, Sept 12 (Reuters) - OVHcloud (OVH.PA), France's biggest home grown cloud services provider, is bracing for potential power cuts later in the year by lining up diesel generators, its chief executive said on Monday.

Europe is striving to lower its dependence on Russia's gas ahead of the coming winter in the wake of the war in Ukraine. While France relies less than its neighbours on Russian supplies, the government has warned businesses they may face power rationing and urged them to cut consumption.

OVHcloud is considered a vital infrastructure by the French government, and thus mostly shielded by potential power cuts. Still, the company is bracing for the worst, CEO Michel Paulin told reporters after unveiling a new data centre in the northeastern city of Strasbourg.

""We test our (diesel) generators every month to every two months,"" Paulin said, warning however that OVHcloud would not be able to use such an alternative source of energy for long.

""We've filled our tanks...(but) these systems are not meant to run for weeks,"" he said.

The French finance ministry is drafting a list of critical industries and sectors that should not suffer any power cuts.

""We have taken many measures, but it depends on the severity of the winter,"" a finance ministry official said, adding that telecommunications and cloud services providers were considered key to keep France going.

A report by the European Commission estimated that the cloud services industry accounted for as much as 4% of the EU's total energy consumption, and that the share was set to rise by almost a third by 2030.

The continuation of OVHcloud's power-hungry services is even more vital for its business and reputation, as the company, which went public 1-1/2 years ago, competes with U.S. tech giants like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google, which dominate data storage worldwide.

Last year, OVHcloud suffered a major fire that took down four of its data centres in Strasbourg.

Paris is eager to build capacity to store sensitive data in France amid concerns the U.S. government can obtain data kept on the servers of the huge companies based there following the adoption of the U.S. Cloud Act in 2018.

OVH presents itself as a secure, domestic alternative to its biggest rivals, and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire also attended the unveiling of the data centre in Strasbourg.

""If we want to be sovereign, we must not have our data stolen,"" Le Maire said.

Yet OVH is tiny compared to the established U.S. companies. It generated sales of 202 million euros ($205 million) in the quarter that ended on May 31, compared to revenue close to $20 billion for Amazon's cloud services branch in the three months to the end of June.

Sept 12 (Reuters) - Zoom Video Communications Inc (ZM.O) said on Monday it has renamed its chat product and added some features, including third party integration, as it looks to compete with rivals including Microsoft's (MSFT.O) Teams and Slack.

Zoom's app, now known as Zoom Team Chat, will also include features such as the ability to share in-meeting chat to Team Chat, schedule a meeting from chat or channel. The featured will be released by the end of the month.

Zoom was a little-known company when the pandemic hit in early 2020, but posted triple-digit revenue growth at the peak of the crisis as people stuck at home took to video-conferencing to communicate.

The company, which competes with WeChat Work, Microsoft Teams, Cisco (CSCO.O) WebEx and Slack, faces an uphill task of onboarding high-paying clients to sustain its growth at a time when several firms are shifting to hybrid work.

Last month, Zoom cut its annual profit and revenue forecasts as demand cools off from pandemic highs. read more

Sept 12 (Reuters) - The U.S Department of Justice has subpoenaed some short sellers for trading information on firms including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), as part of a short-selling probe, Bloomberg News reported on Monday.

The DOJ sent subpoenas over the past few months seeking details on transactions in several blue-chip stocks, according to the report that cited people familiar with the matter. (https://bloom.bg/3quLbIi)

The DOJ last year also issued subpoenas to dozens of firms, including Citron Research and Muddy Waters Research LLC, as it probes potentially manipulative trading around negative reports on listed companies published by some of their investors.

The U.S. securities regulator has also said it has been considering measures that require big investors to disclose more about short positions, or bets that stocks will fall, and the use of derivatives to speculate on stock moves.

The DOJ, Microsoft, Amazon and JPMorgan did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

Sept 12 (Reuters) - Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) has started to offer MySQL HeatWave, its cloud database service for transactions, analytics and machine learning, on Amazon's AWS cloud, allowing customers whose data is already parked there to use the service, the U.S. company said on Monday.

The new offering is not through a partnership with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) which has its own range of database services that Oracle competes with, said Edward Screven, chief corporate architect of Oracle. He said Oracle does have a partnership with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and will be offering this database platform on the Azure cloud in the future.

Screven said customers who have parked their data on AWS in the past would have had to pay expensive fees to move that data to Oracle's cloud to use the MySQL HeatWave service.

""We actually run MySQL HeatWave on Amazon infrastructure. So we've done a lot of work to port and tune MySQL HeatWave to the Amazon environment,"" he said.

Sept 12 (Reuters) - Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) met Wall Street targets for first-quarter revenue on Monday as the enterprise software maker started to reap the benefits of buying healthcare IT firm Cerner.

Demand for its cloud services also remained strong, driving segment revenue up 45% to $3.6 billion, including contribution from Cerner.

With hybrid work gaining traction worldwide, Oracle has been looking to bolster its cloud offerings in a bid to catch up to bigger rivals Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Azure and Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) Web Services.

""Oracle's advantage is their reliability. I see opportunity there for Oracle to preserve its customer base as they move processes to the cloud,"" said John Freeman, vice president of equity research at CFRA Research.

Cerner contributed $1.4 billion in the quarter, months after Oracle bought it in a deal that unlocked troves of data from one of the biggest U.S. healthcare IT firms and attracted more clients to its cloud platform. read more .

The boost from Cerner helped cushion the impact from a slowdown in business spending, as companies turned thrifty in the face of high inflation and an advancing U.S. dollar.

On a constant currency basis, Oracle forecast revenue would grow between 21% and 23% in the second quarter.

It reported adjusted profit of $1.03 per share, compared with a Refinitiv IBES estimate of $1.07, but said the figure would have been 8 cents higher without a ""significant impact"" from the strong greenback.

Total revenue rose 17.7% to $11.45 billion, in line with estimates.

Summary Companies U.S. consumer prices rise unexpectedly

Likelihood grows of a 100 bp Fed rate hike in Sept

Indexes slide: Dow 3.94%, S&P 4.32%, Nasdaq 5.16%















NEW YORK, Sept 13 (Reuters) - A broad sell-off sent U.S. stocks reeling on Tuesday after a hotter-than-expected inflation report dashed hopes that the Federal Reserve could relent and scale back its policy tightening in the coming months.

All three major U.S. stock indexes veered sharply lower, snapping four-day winning streaks and notching their biggest one-day percentage drops since June 2020 during the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Surging risk-off sentiment pulled every major sector deep into negative territory, with interest-rate-sensitive tech and tech-adjacent market leaders, led by Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) weighing heaviest.

""(The sell-off) is not a surprise given the rally running up to the data,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.

The Labor Department's consumer price index (CPI) came in above consensus, interrupting a cooling trend and throwing cold water on hopes that the Federal Reserve could relent after September and ease up on its interest rate hikes. read more

Core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, increased more than expected, rising to 6.3% from 5.9% in July.

The report points to ""very persistent inflation and that means the Fed is going to remain engaged and raise rates,"" Nolte added. ""And that’s an anathema to equities.""

Financial markets have fully priced in an interest rate hike of at least 75 basis points at the conclusion of the FOMC's policy meeting next week, with a 32% probability of a super-sized, full-percentage-point increase to the Fed funds target rate, according to CME's FedWatch tool. FEDWATCH

""The Fed has increased (interest rates) by three full percentage points in the last six months,"" Nolte said. ""We have not yet felt the full impact of all those increases. But we will feel it.""

""We are at recession’s doorstep.""

Worries persist that a prolonged period of policy tightening from the Fed could tip the economy over the brink of recession.

The inversion of yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes, regarded as a red flag of impending recession, widened further.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 1,276.37 points, or 3.94%, to 31,104.97, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 177.72 points, or 4.32%, to 3,932.69 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 632.84 points, or 5.16%, to 11,633.57.

All 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 ended the session deep in red territory.

Communications services (.SPLRCL), consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) and tech (.SPLRCT) shares all plummeted more than 5%, while the tech subset semiconductor sector (.SOX) sank 6.2%.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 7.76-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.64-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

328,457,Microsoft,2022-09-13,'Challenge' to maintain world's focus on global health after COVID-19: Bill Gates,"













LONDON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Asking the world to prioritise saving lives in the world's poorest countries is increasingly challenging in a world still rocked by the COVID-19 pandemic, the threat of climate change, rising energy costs and the war in Ukraine, according to Bill Gates.

The Microsoft co-founder turned philanthropist said it was a ""paradox"" that in the wake of a huge global health threat, funding for tackling diseases like malaria and AIDS could actually drop this year.

""I am very worried… ironically, in the face of the clearest indication of why infectious disease is not a thing of the past, in fact, the funding levels could go down,"" said Gates in an interview with Reuters last week.

He was speaking ahead of the publication of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's annual Goalkeepers report, which tracks progress on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), around reducing poverty and improving health.

The report finds that the pandemic has knocked the world off-course on almost every indicator, and progress would need to speed up by a factor of five in order to reach the targets set for 2030 on issues like reducing maternal mortality or ending malnutrition.

""It's hard to overstate what a setback the pandemic has been and it's hard to overstate what a setback the war in Ukraine is,"" said Gates, who pointed out that pre-2019, global health was improving in most areas.

""It is fair to say that saving lives in Africa and caring about the poorest countries, we'll be challenged to maintain that as a priority and not cut back on those things,"" he added.

Gates has channelled more of his own money into the foundation this year and it will up its annual budget from $6 billion to $9 billion by 2026, but he said he was concerned about the competing pressures on the budgets of donor governments.

However, Gates said there was still hope, particularly in areas like food security, if the world invests in innovation.

Summary Companies Microsoft makes first climate-tech fund investment

Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund also invests

Seeks companies driving energy transition















LONDON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Climate-focused venture firm Energy Impact Partners (EIP) has launched its first European fund, raising 390 million euros ($392.03 million) from investors including the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, its co-managing partner told Reuters.

EIP, which manages around $2.5 billion in assets, said the fund would seek out companies in the region helping drive the transition to a low-carbon economy.

In addition to traditional funding for the start-ups, EIP also offers them a chance to meet and work with a coalition of major industrial companies it has partnered with -- some with an interest in the technologies introduced by the new players.

That coalition of 50-plus companies span some of the heaviest emitting sectors such as energy, transport and agriculture, many of which also backed the new fund, including Fortum (FORTUM.HE), and Galp (GALP.LS).

To-date, EIP said the model of connecting strategic investors with start-ups, had resulted in portfolio companies signing over 350 contracts for a combined value of more than $1 billion.

""These incumbents are the ones that own the critical infrastructure, and if we want those to decarbonise, we have to work with them,"" Co-Managing Partner Nazo Moosa said.

Other companies investing in the European fund include Électricité de France (EDF.PA), Shell (SHEL.L), EWE AG (LANDWE.UL), Mainova (MNVG.F), AGL Energy Ltd (AGL.AX), TrønderEnergi AS (TROEN.UL) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), through its Climate Innovation Fund.

Other financial investors include Norwegian government-backed Nysnø Climate Investments and Dutch pension fund ABP, through its asset manager APG.

Moosa said the fund will invest between $10 million and $40 million in Series A, B and C funding rounds, and expects to invest the money over the next couple of years in up to 18 firms.

To-date, EIP has invested in a number of European firms including renewable energy supplier Zolar, portable battery provide Instagrid, and environmental, social and governance data provider ESG Book.

Moosa said Europe was leading the world in various aspects of the low-carbon transition, making it a fertile hunting ground for new companies.

Europe aspires to become the first carbon-neutral continent, and regulations are expected to support the goal, creating a likely boost for portfolio companies.

Brandon Middaugh, director of the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund, said in a statement that it picked EIP as its first fund investment in climate tech as part of the company's efforts to become carbon negative by 2030.

Sept 14 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) deal to buy videogame publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) is expected to face an in-depth UK probe after the software maker did not offer any remedies to assuage competition concerns, the Financial Times reported.

Microsoft chose not to offer any remedies to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) at this stage because there were no obvious commitments the UK regulator would be likely to accept, the report said on Wednesday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

The CMA said earlier this month that the takeover of the ""Call of Duty"" maker could hurt competition in gaming consoles, subscription services and cloud gaming if Microsoft refused to give competitors access to Activision's best-selling games.

Microsoft and Activision did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment, while CMA declined to respond.

The EU investigation could take time to examine the deal, which is also facing an in-depth probe in Brussels, because of its size and the rising concerns from rivals, including Sony, the report added.

Sept 15 (Reuters) - Major tech companies on Thursday committed to taking fresh steps to combat online extremism by removing more violent content and promoting media literacy with young users, as part of a White House summit on fighting hate-fueled violence.

Platforms like Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) YouTube and Meta Platforms' (META.O) Facebook have come under fire for years from critics who say the companies have allowed hate speech, lies and violent rhetoric to flourish on their services.

U.S. President Joe Biden earlier on Thursday called on Americans to combat racism and extremism during a summit at the White House that gathered experts and survivors and included bipartisan local leaders. read more

YouTube said it will expand its policies on violent extremism to remove content that glorifies violent acts, even if the creators of the videos are not related to a terrorist organization.

The video streaming site already prohibits violent incitement, but in at least some cases has not applied existing policies to videos promoting militia groups involved with the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol.

A report by the Tech Transparency Project in May found 435 pro-militia videos on YouTube, including 85 posted since the Jan. 6 attack. Some of the videos gave training advice, like how to carry out guerilla-style ambushes.

YouTube spokesman Jack Malon declined to say whether the service would change its approach to that content under the new policy, but said the update enables it to go further with enforcement than it had previously.

YouTube also said it will launch a media literacy campaign to teach younger users how to spot the manipulation tactics that are used to spread misinformation.

Microsoft (MSFT.O) said it will make a basic and more affordable version of its artificial intelligence and machine learning tools available to schools and smaller organizations in order to help them detect and prevent violence.

Facebook owner Meta announced it will partner with researchers from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies' Center on Terrorism, Extremism and Counterterrorism.

Last year, lawmakers grilled the chief executives of Alphabet and Facebook, as well as Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), on whether their companies bore some responsibility for the Jan. 6 attack.

333,822,Microsoft,2022-09-15,Colorado data project highlights need to compel information from prosecutors,"Law firms Loyola University Health System Follow















(Reuters) - A bipartisan group of eight Colorado district attorneys has launched an online resource that provides an unprecedented amount of data about how their offices prosecute cases, part of a nationwide trend to improve transparency spurred by racial justice protests in 2020.

The “data dashboards” unveiled on Sept. 8 cover many of the largest jurisdictions in Colorado, including Denver and Boulder (8 of 22 judicial districts). They include information ranging from whether people were jailed before trial to charging decisions and ultimate outcomes – sentences, diversion of cases to drug court or dismissal entirely.

The goal, broadly speaking, is to respond to some of the public’s questions and demands about race discrimination in the justice system over the past several years, like whether prosecutors offer Black and Latino defendants worse plea deals. The participating offices expect that the data will tell a story that helps them understand line prosecutors’ choices, what’s working and what isn’t.

The project is a commendable, if long overdue, effort to address discrimination from prosecutors' offices – a part of the criminal justice system that often lacks transparency despite those officials’ singular power to shape local law enforcement and courts.

It’s a common-sense example for other states and jurisdictions to follow. Plea deals, for example, are largely inscrutable to the public, even though they are more integral to the justice system than trials. More than 90% of both state and federal convictions are obtained via plea bargaining, according to a 2020 review of existing research into plea deals by the Vera Institute of Justice.

Still, the massive gaps in U.S. criminal justice data, and historical resistance to similar self-reporting efforts by judicial officers themselves, are reason to be cautious even about the prospects of Colorado’s groundbreaking project.

Voluntary reporting is a necessary first step, given that most jurisdictions don’t require prosecutors to collect data and many simply don’t. State legislation, like a 2018 judicial transparency law enacted in Florida, remains necessary to compel prosecutors to provide the public with the basic information necessary to evaluate their functions and performance.

The DAs partnered with groups including the Prosecutorial Performance Indicators project, and the Microsoft Justice Reform Initiative. The project was launched in Colorado in part because its judicial districts use a uniform, statewide data management system -- and there was a large enough group of prosecutors willing to participate, according to Melba Pearson, a Prosecutorial Performance Indicators project member and policy director at Florida International University's Center for the Administration of Justice. Project leaders are hoping to expand into other states, she said.

Don Stemen, chairperson of the criminology department at Loyola University Chicago and also a project participant, said that the project thus far shows what's happening, not why, adding that future analyses will begin to explain racial disparities.

Very few prosecutors have released data dashboards, and few efforts include multiple jurisdictions, Stemen said. The “simultaneous release of data dashboards by eight offices in the same state is really quite unique – and makes these offices more transparent than the very large majority of prosecutors’ offices across the country.”

The data is already revealing racial disparities across the board, as one might expect.

Black, Hispanic and Native American people were more likely to be held in pretrial detention than white defendants in six judicial districts, according to the data. The other two offices didn't provide pretrial demographic information, according to the Colorado dashboards.

Last year, 31% of white defendants who were convicted were held in pretrial detention in Gilpin and Jefferson counties, compared with 43% of Black and 36% of Hispanic defendants.

In other districts, more white defendants had their charges reduced than Black or Hispanic folks and received more deferred judgments (a kind of probation).

Alexis King, the district attorney in Gilpin and Jefferson counties, was not available for comment. A spokesperson noted that race disparities in pretrial detention are pervasive and said there aren't significant disparities in plea offers and sentences in King's district.

Research into prosecutorial decisions is scant but the data from Colorado comports with previous studies in other states.

A 2018 study of felony and misdemeanor cases in Wisconsin from 1999 to 2006 found that white people were 25% more likely than Black folks to have their initial charges reduced, according to the Vera Institute’s 2020 review of plea bargaining studies.

Another research summary by the U.S. Justice Department in 2011 concluded that “the majority of research on race and sentencing outcomes shows that blacks are less likely than whites to receive reduced pleas” and that this relationship “between race and receiving a reduced plea has been consistent.”

The Urban Institute undertook the most comprehensive national survey of local DAs offices in 2018. It found that fewer than half collect basic case information, and even fewer make that information public.

Kim Foxx, state’s attorney in Cook County, Illinois, has released the most comprehensive prosecutorial data to date – six years of raw criminal case data, according to a 2019 report by the ACLU on the need for prosecutorial transparency laws.

But even that best-in-class release included glaring gaps regarding misdemeanors and juvenile cases, the ACLU said. (Foxx explained that there were problems extracting some data because different entities used different case management systems.)

The Colorado effort, too, has its own shortcomings: the full data sets have not been made public. Only five years of data was included and some offices didn’t release data that could show racial disparities in various prosecutorial decisions, according to Colorado Public Radio.

At the other end of the spectrum, some prosecutors simply refuse lawful information requests. Massachusetts prosecutors consistently stonewalled requests by journalists for basic information, like a list of cases prosecuted, until the attorney general won a lawsuit against them in 2018 for violating open records laws, according to the ACLU report.

This history demonstrates that voluntary data releases aren’t sufficient to ensure public access to basic information about prosecutorial decisions. The Colorado DAs should be lauded for taking a bold first step past the status quo, but the kind of transparency envisioned by advocates is unlikely without some legal obligation on prosecutors' part.

Summary

Summary Companies Much of Bengaluru submerged in recent flooding

Residents forced to wade through waist-deep water

Disruptions raise questions about city's future as tech hub

Authorities vow to act, but extreme weather may complicate plans















BENGALURU, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Harish Pullanoor spent his weekends in the late 1980s tramping around the marshes and ponds of Yemalur, an area then on the eastern edge of the Indian metropolis of Bengaluru, where his cousins would join him catching small freshwater fish.

In the 1990s, Bengaluru, once a genteel city of gardens, lakes and a cool climate, rapidly became India's answer to Silicon Valley, attracting millions of workers and the regional headquarters of some of the world's biggest IT companies.

The untrammelled expansion came at a price.

Concrete replaced green spaces and construction around the edge of lakes blocked off connecting canals, limiting the city's capacity to absorb and siphon off water.

The heaviest rainfall in decades led to flooding in India’s IT hub Bengaluru in early September

Last week, after the city's heaviest rains in decades, the Yemalur neighbourhood was submerged under waist-deep water along with some other parts of Bengaluru, disrupting the southern metropolis' IT industry and dealing a blow to its reputation.

Residents fed up with gridlocked traffic and water shortages during the dry season have long complained about the city's infrastructure.

But flooding during the monsoon has raised fresh questions about the sustainability of rapid urban development, especially if weather patterns become more erratic and intense because of climate change.

""It's very, very sad,"" said Pullanoor, who was born close to Yemalur but now lives in the western city of Mumbai, parts of which also face sporadic flooding like many of India's urban centres.

""The trees have disappeared. The parks have almost disappeared. There is chock-a-block traffic.""

Big businesses are also complaining about worsening disruptions, which they say can cost them tens of millions of dollars in a single day.

Bengaluru hosts more than 3,500 IT companies and some 79 ""tech parks"" - upmarket premises that house offices and entertainment areas catering to technology workers.

Wading through flooded highways last week, they struggled to reach modern glass-faced complexes in and around Yemalur where multinational firms including JP Morgan and Deloitte operate alongside large Indian start-ups.

Millionaire entrepreneurs were among those forced to escape flooded living rooms and swamped bedrooms on the back of tractors.

Insurance companies said initial estimates for loss of property were ran into millions of rupees, with numbers expected to go up in the next few days.

'GLOBAL IMPACT'

The latest chaos triggered renewed worries from the $194 billion Indian IT services industry that is concentrated around the city.

""India is a tech hub for global enterprises, so any disruption here will have a global impact. Bangalore, being the centre of IT, will be no exception to this,"" said K.S. Viswanathan, vice president at industry lobby group the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM).

Bangalore was renamed Bengaluru in 2014.

NASSCOM is currently working to identify 15 new cities that could become software export hubs, said Viswanathan, who is driving the project.

""It is not a city-versus-city story,"" he told Reuters. ""We as a country don't want to miss out on revenue and business opportunities because of a lack of infrastructure.""

Even before the floods, some business groups including the Outer Ring Road Companies Association (ORRCA) that is led by executives from Intel (INTC.O), Goldman Sachs, Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Wipro (WIPR.NS), warned inadequate infrastructure in Bengaluru could encourage companies to leave.

""We have been talking about these for years,"" Krishna Kumar, general manager of ORRCA, said last week of problems related to Bengaluru's infrastructure. ""We have come to a serious point now and all companies are on the same page.""

Thomson Reuters (TRI.TO) also has major operations in Bengaluru.

""The safety of all employees is always our top priority,"" the company said in a statement. ""While Thomson Reuters employees in Bangalore continue to work remotely throughout the recent flooding, there has been no impact to our operations.""

In the early 1970s, more than 68% of Bengaluru was covered in vegetation.

By the late 1990s, the city's green cover had dropped to around 45% and by 2021 to less than 3% of its total area of 741 square kilometres, according to an analysis by T.V. Ramachandra of Bengaluru's Indian Institute of Science (IISC).

Green spaces can help absorb and temporarily store storm water, helping to protect built up areas.

""If this trend continues, by 2025, 98.5% (of the city) will be choked with concrete,"" said Ramachandra, who is part of IISC's Centre for Ecological Sciences.

CITY IN DECAY

Rapid urban expansion, often featuring illegal structures built without permission, has affected Bengaluru's nearly 200 lakes and a network of canals that once connected them, according to experts.

So when heavy rains lash the city like they did last week, drainage systems are unable to keep up, especially in low-lying areas like Yemalur.

The state government of Karnataka, where Bengaluru is located, said last week it would spent 3 billion Indian rupees ($37.8 million) to help manage the flood situation, including removing unauthorised developments, improving drainage systems and controlling water levels in lakes.

""All the encroachments will be removed without any mercy,"" Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai told reporters. ""I will personally go and inspect.""

Authorities have identified around 50 areas in Bengaluru that have been illegally developed. Those included high-end villas and apartments, according to Tushar Girinath, Chief Commissioner of Bengaluru's civic authority.

Last week, the state government also announced it would set up a body to manage Bengaluru's traffic and start discussions on a new storm water drainage project along a major highway.

Critics called the initiatives a knee-jerk reaction that could peter out.

""Every time it floods, only then we discuss,"" said IISC's Ramachandra. ""Bengaluru is decaying. It will die.""

335,578,Microsoft,2022-09-15,Adobe’s $20 bln deal uses ample creative license,"













NEW YORK, Sept 15 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Does Adobe’s Photoshop work in spreadsheets? The design technology titan is acquiring startup Figma for $20 billion, using roughly half cash and half shares, in a deal that will significantly beef up its online collaboration capabilities. To justify paying 50 times annual recurring revenue, however, requires the sort of reality distortion power of the buyer’s image editing software.

It’s a big transaction for Adobe boss Shantanu Narayen. The $145 billion company he leads generally targets smaller takeovers while developing new products and improving existing ones internally. Decade-old Figma, however, managed to crack the code for multiple users to watch each other design and edit documents in real time, rapidly attracting customers at Microsoft (MSFT.O) and beyond. Figma also has blatantly poked its bigger rival, crowing on its website: “Don’t sync to the cloud with Adobe XD.”

The deal could indeed be “transformational,” as Narayen says in the overused merger handbook vernacular. To make it so, Adobe would have to successfully adapt its own software to Figma’s engineering for a significant top-line uplift. As it stands, Figma’s revenue is expected to double this year to $400 million. Even if it doubled again in 2023, it would represent just 4% of the $20 billion that analysts expect Adobe to generate, according to Refinitiv.

This math suggests Narayen has used too much creative license. Adobe already had lost more than a third of its market value this year before the Figma news was announced as part of the broader flight from both publicly traded tech stocks and privately backed firms. And yet even then Adobe saw fit to double up on the $10 billion Figma valuation from June 2021, per PitchBook, and shell out an eye-popping multiple of sales.

Adobe investors couldn’t muster the same amount of imagination. They sent the shares tumbling 16%, wiping out another $27 billion of market capitalization, on the same day the company unveiled 13% top-line quarterly growth from a year earlier. Ignoring conventions is generally better suited to art than finance.

Adobe said on Sept. 15 it had agreed to buy digital design rival Figma for about $20 billion, paying about half in cash and half in shares.

Figma, which was started in 2012, expects to make more than $400 million in annual recurring revenue in 2022, roughly doubling from the previous year. It has a gross margin of about 90%, Adobe said.

Adobe also reported record revenue of $4.4 billion for its fiscal third quarter ending Sept. 2, a 13% increase from the same period a year earlier. Its $4.5 billion forecast for the next three-month period fell slightly short of analysts' forecasts, according to Refinitiv.

336,127,Microsoft,2022-09-15,UK watchdog wants deeper probe into Microsoft's $69-bln Activision deal,"













Sept 15 (Reuters) - Britain's antitrust watchdog said on Thursday it would launch an in-depth probe into Xbox maker Microsoft's (MSFT.O) $69-billion purchase of ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) after the tech giant failed to offer remedies to soothe competition concerns.

The deal, announced in January, will require approval in the United States as well as other major jurisdictions including the European Union and China.

Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said earlier this month the takeover of the videogame publisher maker could hurt competition in gaming consoles, subscription services and cloud gaming if Microsoft refused to give competitors access to Activision's best-selling games. read more

The regulator had given the companies until Sept. 8 to submit proposals to address the CMA's concerns.

On Thursday, the CMA added that Microsoft informed the regulator that it would not be offering any undertakings.

Microsoft did not offer any remedies during the preliminary investigation because the CMA typically prefers significant concessions in the first phase, a person familiar with the matter said.

Microsoft, on the other hand, reiterated its statement from early September saying that it is ready to work with the CMA on next steps and address any of its concerns.

Activision did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.

Reuters previously reported that Microsoft would pay a $3 billion break-up fee if the deal falls through, according to a source familiar with the matter, suggesting the company was confident of winning antitrust approval. read more

A spokesperson for Microsoft rival Sony Interactive Entertainment welcomed the CMA's move.

“We welcome today’s announcement by the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) that it has opened a full-scale investigation into Microsoft’s proposed acquisition of Activision.

""By giving Microsoft control of Activision games like Call of Duty, this deal would have major negative implications for gamers and the future of the gaming industry. We want to guarantee PlayStation gamers continue to have the highest quality gaming experience, and we appreciate the CMA’s focus on protecting gamers.”

337,595,Microsoft,2022-09-15,Biden says haters won't have 'last word'; wants to end social media immunity,"













WASHINGTON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden called on Americans to speak out against racism and extremism during a summit at the White House on Thursday, and said he would ask Congress to do more to hold social media companies accountable for spreading hate.

""White supremacists will not have the last word,"" Biden told the 'United We Stand' summit of bipartisan local leaders, experts and survivors.

Biden said America had long experienced a ""through line of hate"" against minority groups, one that had been given ""too much oxygen"" by politics and the media in recent years.

""It's so important that we keep hollering,"" he said. ""It's so important for people to know that's not who we are.""

The event also recognized communities that suffered hate-based attacks, including mass shootings at a gay nightclub in Orlando in 2016 and at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket earlier this year, in which 10 Black people were gunned down by an avowed racist.

Hate crimes in the United States hit a 12-year high in 2020, the last available data, the FBI said last year. read more

Biden was introduced by Susan Bro, mother of Heather Heyer, who was killed during an August 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""Her murder resonated around the world, but the hate did not begin or end there,"" Bro said.

Participants gave Biden a standing ovation when he said he wanted Congress to ""hold social media companies accountable for spreading hate.""

""I'm calling on Congress to get rid of special immunity for social media companies and impose much stronger transparency requirements on all of them,"" Biden said.

The White House had repeatedly called for revoking Section 230, a law that shields online companies from liability over content posted by users, and has also supported ramping up anti-trust and transparency enforcement on technology companies.

The White House event comes just weeks after Biden warned in a speech in Philadelphia that extremist Republicans are a threat to democracy.

Biden addressed criticism that the speech was divisive on Thursday.

""Silence is complicity, we can't remain silent,"" Biden said. ""There are those that say we bring this up, we divide the country. Bringing it up we silence it.""

Biden announced a $1 billion push by philanthropists to build bridges among Americans of different backgrounds, and an initiative supported by the foundations of former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Gerald Ford.

Several big technology companies also joined in. YouTube said it was expanding its efforts to combat violent extremism by removing content glorifying violent acts for the purpose of inspiring others to commit harm, fundraise, or recruit.

Microsoft said it was expanding use of artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to detect credible threats of violence, and use gaming to build empathy. read more

Federal agencies also announced new initiatives.

Attorney General Merrick Garland told the summit that all 94 U.S. Attorneys' Offices would work on a ""United Against Hate"" initiative over the next year, to increase community understanding and reporting of hate crimes, and build trust between law enforcement and communities.

338,581,Microsoft,2022-09-16,U.S. energy chief Granholm meets with New England governors on fuel supplies,"













WASHINGTON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm met with the governors of six states in the U.S. Northeast on Thursday to talk about their concerns about soaring fuel costs heading into winter, the Department of Energy said.

The meeting came after governors, including Charles Baker of Massachusetts, Janet Mills of Maine and Ned Lamont of Connecticut, wrote Granholm in July about their concerns about prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) and other fuels in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Participants in the meeting talked about ways to ensure adequate supplies of electricity and heating fuels in region which typically experiences tight energy markets in winter, a source at the DOE said.

The DOE has made sure contracts for LNG for industry and other consumers are in place. In addition, President Joe Biden's infrastructure law last year included a $500 million boost in funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps U.S. consumers access heating fuel and weatherize their homes, and the administration has called on Congress for more funding.

""This meeting is an opportunity to talk about what has happened and how we can continue to stay really closely aligned to mitigate any risks on reliability and try to maintain affordability (of fuel) in the coming weeks and months,"" the source said.

The New England governors said in the letter that the DOE should explore suspending the Jones Act, a law requiring goods moved between U.S. ports to be carried by U.S. staffed and flagged ships that are built domestically, for part or all of the upcoming winter.

They also urged the department to see how its heating oil and gasoline reserves in the Northeast, which hold a total of 2 million barrels of fuel, could be used this winter and to see about modernizing them given the region's changing resource mix.

In response to a question about waiving the Jones Act, the source reiterated that LNG contracts have been ensured. ""In the event that there is an issue where additional supplies of heating fuels are needed, we would work with the states as appropriate to see what tools are needed,"" the source added.

Granholm late last month urged the seven major U.S. oil refiners including Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N) to not increase fuel exports after energy companies sent record shipments abroad as domestic oil production rose and global fuel demand recovered. read more

Granholm ""underscored the concern about the low levels of privately-held refined product inventories in key regions, including New England, and its ask of oil and gas companies to ensure they are building adequate inventories to handle disruptions from hurricanes or other events,"" the DOE said in a statement about the meeting.

Sept 19 (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N) said on Monday a hacker affiliated with the Lapsus$ hacking group was responsible for a cyber attack that forced the ride-hailing company to shut several internal communications temporarily last week.

Uber said the attacker had not accessed any user accounts and the databases that store sensitive user information such as credit card numbers, bank account or trip details.

""The attacker accessed several internal systems, and our investigation has focused on determining whether there was any material impact,"" Uber said, adding that investigation was still ongoing.

The company said it was in close coordination with the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice on the matter.

Friday's cybersecurity incident had brought down Uber's internal communication system for a while and employees were restricted to use Salesforce-owned office messaging app Slack. read more

Uber said the attacker logged in to a contractor's Uber account after they accepted a two-factor login approval request following multiple requests, giving the hacker access to several employee accounts and tools such as G-Suite and Slack.

The hacking group, Lapsus$, has targeted firms including Nvidia (NVDA.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Okta Inc (OKTA.O), an authentication services company relied on by thousands of major businesses.

Lapsus$ could not be immediately reached for comment.

The hacker, who goes by the name ""teapotuberhacker,"" also reportedly claimed to leak early gameplay footage of Take-Two Interactive Software Inc's muck-awaited game ""Grand Theft Auto VI"" on Monday.

The hacker had posted a message on the forum about seeking to ""negotiate a deal"" with the videogaming company. read more

340,816,Microsoft,2022-09-20,Petrodollar rush may disappoint Western financiers,"













LONDON, Sept 20 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Fossil-fuel producers are minting money again. Yet Western financiers hoping to share in the spoils of a 1970s-style petrodollar boom will be disappointed.

High energy prices, caused by Russia’s Ukraine invasion, mean the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will earn $907 billion from oil exports this year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), compared with $577 billion on average since 2000. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait will collectively have a $409 billion current account surplus, reckons Capital Economics, or almost three times last year’s total. Russia’s current account surplus so far in 2022 has also tripled, year-on-year.

In previous petrodollar booms, energy producers have recycled their windfalls into the Western financial system. Saudi, for example, racked up a cumulative $160 billion current account surplus between 1974 and 1982, according to economist David Lubin’s book “Dance of the Trillions”, almost all of which went into the eurodollar market – a term for dollar-denominated deposits held outside of America, for example in European banks or the European branches of U.S. lenders. The banks in turn lent those deposits to Argentina, Chile and others in an emerging-market debt boom.

When energy prices spiked again in the early 21st century, fossil-fuel producers funnelled proceeds into Western financial assets, through central-bank reserves and sovereign wealth funds. Middle Eastern oil exporters and Russia together increased their holdings of U.S. debt and equity securities by almost $500 billion between 2003 and 2008, a fivefold increase that was only beaten in absolute terms by China and the Cayman Islands. That buttressed demand for U.S. stocks and bonds, while oil exporters and tycoons also splurged on European soccer clubs and department stores.

These financial flows, known as petrodollar recycling, mean that the money Westerners spend on fuel eventually makes its way back into their economies through energy producers’ financial investments. It’s happening again. Saudi’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) has opened new offices in London and New York read more , and this summer went on a U.S. equity-market shopping spree read more , scooping up shares in Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O). The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority recently poached New York-based Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) rainmaker Drew Goldman to run real-estate investing.

But the spoils may disappoint Western financiers with long memories. First, they’re smaller in relative terms. Adjusted for inflation, OPEC’s revenue was higher between 2010 and 2014 than it will be this year, EIA data shows. Saudi, the UAE, Kuwait and Qatar’s forecast 2022 current account surplus will be worth 1.6% of U.S. GDP, compared with 2.5% in 1974, according to Breakingviews calculations based on Capital Economics, Federal Reserve and Bank of England data.

Second, the energy producers may choose to squirrel away some of their proceeds elsewhere. Sanctions prevent Russia, for example, from investing in U.S. and European financial assets even if it wanted to. And the West’s decision to freeze Moscow’s foreign-exchange reserves may encourage Gulf states to spread their bets, lest they one day find themselves in Russia’s shoes. Global dollar- and euro-denominated central-bank currency reserves had already dipped to 79% of the total in March 2022 compared with 85% six years earlier, according to International Monetary Fund data.

Finally, OPEC countries face huge domestic investment requirements to reduce their reliance on selling fossil fuels as the world moves towards renewable energy. For Saudi, that could mean spending more on education to boost its services sector, or building up the non-oil portion of its manufacturing industry, like solar power.

The kingdom’s human rights record has undermined its hoped-for foreign direct investment boom, but the energy windfall could serve as a substitute. For the second year in a row, the IMF expects the PIF to undertake more local investment this year than the Saudi central government. Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan said in May that the country would spend its 2022 surplus wherever it would have “the most positive impact on the economy”, including the National Development Fund, a vehicle designed to help spur private-sector investment read more .

Saudi may of course fail to invest its windfall wisely. Either way, it would mean that Westerners miss out on some of the spoils of the new petrodollar boom. Banks, buyout barons and high-end real-estate agents may bemoan that, but not everyone should.

Previous episodes of petrodollar recycling coincided with harmful asset bubbles. The 1970s Latin American lending boom quickly became the 1980s Latin American debt crisis, with many countries unable to service their foreign borrowings. Petrodollar demand helped keep U.S. borrowing costs low in the run-up to 2008 even as the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates, arguably contributing to the pre-crisis excess. The lesson is that huge financial flows, while enriching middlemen on Wall Street and in the City of London, often also destabilise the economy. A more muted petrodollar boom might not be such a bad thing after all.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will collectively earn $907 billion of net oil export revenue in 2022, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in August.

That compares with an annual average of $577 billion since 2000.

341,377,Microsoft,2022-09-21,NZ's Ardern says Christchurch Call anti-online hate project gets new tech investments,"













WELLINGTON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Wednesday announced a new research initiative under a global project aimed at tackling online hate set up in the wake of a mass killing by a white supremacist in Christchurch in 2019.

Ardern said in a statement that as part of the Christchurch Call initiative, New Zealand, the United States, Twitter (TWTR.N) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) will invest an undisclosed sum in developing new technology aimed at helping researchers understand how algorithms affect internet users' experiences.

Partners in the initiative will work together to build and test a set of privacy-enhancing technologies that, once proven, could form the basis for infrastructure to support independent study of impacts of algorithms, according to the statement.

""This initiative won't tell us all we need to know about the outcomes algorithms are driving online, it will help us better access data so researchers can answer these very questions,"" the statement said.

The Christchurch Call was launched by Ardern and French President Emmanuel Macron after 51 people were killed at two mosques in the New Zealand city while the shooter live-streamed his rampage on Meta's (META.O) Facebook platform.

A simultaneous joint statement from the Christchurch Call said that since a 2021 summit new industry supporters and partner organisations have joined the initiative including game platform Roblox (RBLX.N), video conferencing site Zoom (6694.T), the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund and Tech Against Terrorism.

It said, however, many online service providers remain outside the Call, calling on some unidentified firms unwilling to meet the commitments to join.

342,826,Microsoft,2022-09-21,Pandemic-prompted technological changes create cost-savings for complex business litigation,"













September 21, 2022 - The COVID-19 pandemic that has dominated so much of all our lives also has spurred the rollout of now-necessary technological tools in civil litigation, including developments encouraged by the Federal Judicial Center nearly two decades ago.

Back in 2004, the Center's Manual for Complex Litigation advised that virtual hearings and electronic presentation of evidence could mitigate many of the challenges inherent to complex litigation: ""Videoconferencing makes it possible to present the testimony of absent witnesses, including witnesses recalled for only brief testimony, without the cost and other disadvantages of depositions. In some instances, the cost and burden of obtaining the physical presence of a witness will be disproportionate to the importance of the expected testimony.""

The nature and direction of the changes in litigation technology have long been anticipated — it just took a pandemic to get the courts and parties moving. Judge Herbert B. Dixon proved prescient when, in a July 2013 opinion piece called ""Technology and the Courts: A Futurist View"" in the American Bar Association's Judges Journal, he suggested, under the subheading ""Increased Video Hearings Will Lead to General Acceptance of Virtual Hearings and Trials,"" that the legal profession will abandon its reservations about remote video participation in a court proceeding.

It will not be unusual for an attorney to attend scheduled appearances in several courts across the country in a single day. ... Because of the prevalence of these near-virtual hearings, courts will gradually increase the availability of hearings being transmitted by online streaming.

Judge Dixon foresaw that there would be ""a steady increase in video appearances by parties for motion hearings, including some evidentiary hearings, which will include remote witnesses, lawyers, and judges,"" but also that ""[s]ome judges or lawyers will come to this process kicking and screaming but will nevertheless relent due to necessity, e.g., to avoid an undesired delay in the proceeding.""

The pandemic made concerns about mere ""costs"" or ""undesired delay"" beside the point, as public health concerns kept lawyers and witnesses out of courtrooms and offices, and the choice became one between remote proceedings and none at all. When using videoconferencing technology moved from being a question of ""whether"" to one of ""how,"" innovation came hard and fast on all fronts.

The 2020 CARES Act authorized federal judges to use video and telephone conferences during the COVID-19 emergency, including, with the defendants' consent, in certain criminal proceedings. In response, the Judicial Conference of the United States issued an exception, for the duration of court-ordered emergency procedural orders, to the federal prohibition of cameras and broadcasting in federal court.

Now that there has been proof of concept, it is foreseeable that, when the pandemic ebbs, whatever the continued uses of videoconferencing technology in other kinds of cases, it will be a permanent feature of complex civil litigation.

In response to the pandemic, courts and law firms invested heavily in remote-communication platforms like Zoom, Webex, and Microsoft Teams for internal and external use, and they have become comfortable using those platforms on a regular basis. Setting health risks aside, the demonstrated benefits in terms of cost, time, and convenience for courts, counsel, and clients are compelling and continuing, and there is no good reason to forgo them.

In an article in Skadden's 2022 Insights earlier this year, Lauren Aguiar, Boris Bershteyn, Allison M. Brown and Abigail Davis (Sheehan) noted, ""In many respects, these changes are overdue and — especially in the context of complex multidistrict or cross-border disputes — could reduce some litigation costs. Companies with large litigation portfolios should view remote technology not as a temporary response to a public health crisis, but as a lasting change in how they access the courts."" (""The Pandemic Brought Some Welcome Innovations to the Justice Process, but Also Many New Challenges,"" Skadden's 2022 Insights, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, Jan. 19, 2022)

One perhaps ironic example (in which this author has been involved) has been the enormous wave of insurance coverage litigation in federal and state courts nationally over pandemic-related business losses. Where the commercial coverage was provided by a tower of primary and excess insurers, it has been typical to have trial-court hearings on dispositive motions or appellate arguments that last for hours and have 20 or more attorneys from a host of firms appearing from around the country. Only a handful of these attorneys may actually present substantive argument, while the rest are there to ensure that their clients' separate interests are represented and protected.

Especially during the heights of the pandemic, such hearings risk being ""super spreader"" events if conducted in person. Conducting the hearings by videoconference also has spared counsel expensive and time-consuming travel to the courthouse — not to mention additional time allocated to making sure the attorney arrived in plenty of time in the destination city and at the designated courtroom. It has also often permitted distant clients to watch the proceedings, instead of just waiting for their lawyers' reports.

In addition to court conferences, other aspects of litigation are proving amenable to virtual conferencing. For example, while in-person depositions of key or critical witnesses will remain invaluable, remote depositions of record custodians or witnesses expected to testify as to only limited issues may become commonplace or the norm. In complex civil litigation, where it is more likely that witnesses, parties, and counsel may be spread out, remote depositions make practical sense for witnesses whose testimony may be essential but not especially controversial or hotly contested.

Certain aspects of civil litigation may not be as well-suited to virtual participation. Jury trials may be especially problematic, as jurors who view the trial remotely from home have introduced challenges in keeping their attention and avoiding distractions from their home environments. But jury trials are relatively rare in civil litigation, and even if the case ultimately ends up before an in-person jury, trial lawyers have observed that jurors may feel quite comfortable in watching witnesses testify on large video screens in the courtroom.

In situations where observing nonverbal communications and maintaining eye contact are important for tactical or other reasons, in-person procedures and proceedings will continue. But videoconferencing will remain a valuable alternative or supplement where in-person contact is less critical or overcome by considerations of cost, convenience, and efficiency.

Consistent with the view that many of the innovations rolled out in earnest during the pandemic should be treated and refined as permanent changes to complex civil litigation practice, on Oct. 20, 2021, the James F. Humphreys Complex Litigation Center at George Washington University Law School published for public comment a set of ""Guidelines and Best Practices in Class-Action Litigation.""

These guidelines include recommendations for courts to amend their local rules and practices to incorporate virtual proceedings as a permanently available option in appropriate circumstances. As to class actions, these guidelines recognize that, ""[o]n the parties' request, a court should utilize virtual proceedings for pretrial proceedings, including status conferences, motion hearings, preliminary and final approval hearings to promote efficiency and preserve the resources of the parties.""

The Humphreys Complex Litigation Center's proposed guidelines also recognize the need for courts to state their expectations about counsel's conduct and responsibility for handling the propriety, logistics, security, and contingency preparations associated with the technology. These responsibilities include: ""dress[ing] in appropriate courtroom or business attire,"" ""ensur[ing] that the operation of the remote appearance is run smoothly and efficiently,"" ""tak[ing] steps to ensure that the platform used to make virtual appearances is secure,"" and ""put[ting] in place a contingency plan to address technology or other interruptions.""

The guidelines implicitly require that attorneys have adequate technological support and proficiency to ensure that virtual hearings are run efficiently and securely.

Videoconferencing was greatly eased by the successful deployment of platforms that integrate with Outlook and other email and calendar software, enabling the organizer to circulate secure one-click links that allow invitees to join the conference with preconfigured devices, and without complicated setups, or even entry of long user IDs and passwords. But even such relatively user-friendly systems require some experience with operating and troubleshooting them — lest another embarrassed attorney become the next one to have to explain to a court, like the Texas attorney in 2021, ""I'm not a cat.""

Conducting civil litigation through the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the resilience of our legal processes and the adaptability of most judges, lawyers, and staff. Technologies once thought fanciful have become standard operating proceedings.

The pandemic may have jump-started in two years a transition to advanced communication technology in litigation that otherwise might have taken decades, but that transition will now continue at a pace faster than ever seen before. Courts and counsel should reflect on the recent innovations that should be preserved and refined even after the masks may be put away.

343,424,Microsoft,2022-09-21,Britain's Drax signs deal to sell 2 million U.S. carbon removal credits,"













LONDON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - British power generator Drax (DRX.L) has signed a memorandum of understanding with carbon finance firm Respira International which could see Drax sell up to 2 million carbon removal credits from proposed biomass projects in the United States, the companies said on Wednesday.

Drax is developing technology to capture and store emissions generated at its power plants which burn wood-based biomass pellets in Britain and is seeking to build similar projects in the United States by the mid- to late 2020s. read more

Under the memorandum of understanding announced on Wednesday Respira International has the option to buy up to 2 million tonnes of carbon removals over a five-year period from future Drax operations in the Unites States.

""Securing commitments from customers to buy the removal credits is a big part of what will enable the project to proceed,"" Drax commercial director Angela Hepworth told Reuters.

Drax says that as well as the plants capturing the emissions they create by burning pellets, the absorption of greenhouse gases during the growth of the wood means their overall impact is carbon negative, allowing the projects to generate carbon removal credits.

Many companies have set net zero emissions targets which will require them to purchase carbon offset credits to compensate for the emissions they are unable to cut themselves, with some companies, such as Microsoft (MSFT.O) willing to pay a premium for removal credits, which take carbon emissions out of the atmosphere.

Green groups have criticised the burning of wood biomass pellets, arguing it is not a carbon-neutral method of energy generation and that pellet production can contribute to deforestation.

Drax says it only uses wood residuals or byproducts from trees primarily used for lumber, and that demand for wood from sustainable managed forests can help increase forest growth.

No financial details of the deal were disclosed.

Sept 21 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) LinkedIn said that its app and website were functional after a brief interruption on Wednesday.

Earlier in the day, nearly 15,000 users had reported issues with the social networking service, according to Downdetector.

""Pardon us. If you were having trouble viewing LinkedIn today, we're back in action,"" LinkedIn said in a tweet. (https://bit.ly/3R25A2q)

Downdetector tracks outages by collating status reports from a number of sources including user-submitted errors on its platform. The outage may have affected a larger number of users.

A majority of users across the United States, however, reported that they had issues accessing LinkedIn's website.

345,367,Microsoft,2022-09-22,Accenture warns of forex hit amid strong IT services' demand,"













Sept 22 (Reuters) - Accenture Plc on Thursday warned this year's dollar surge would hurt its fiscal 2023 results, even as robust demand for digital offerings helped the IT services major top quarterly earnings estimates.

U.S. firms with large overseas operations such as Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Salesforce have in recent months flagged the toll from the strongest greenback in two decades.

Accenture, which generates more than half of its revenue from outside the United States, expects a 6% hit to results from the dollar in fiscal 2023. A strong greenback usually eats into profits of firms that convert foreign currencies into dollars.

The company's first-quarter revenue forecast of $15.20 billion to $15.75 billion was also below the $16.07 billion expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv data.

While the annual revenue forecast was a tad higher than estimates, the profit view widely lagged that of Wall Street.

Demand for IT services, however, remains strong from businesses looking to expand their digital presence, somewhat shielding the sector.

Accenture, whose offerings include cloud and security services, reported new bookings of $18.40 billion for the fourth quarter ended Aug. 31, its second highest on record.

Analysts have cautioned that an economic slowdown could dent IT budgets and cracks have already started showing after ""measured"" client spending forced Salesforce to cut its forecasts. read more

""Concern for Accenture and other IT Consulting firms is the increasing indication of new IT deployments being halted,"" said Erik Bradley, chief strategist at research firm ETR.

""The initial expectations for total 2023 spend is currently at 5.9% growth for next year, a muted number compared to recent years.""

Quarterly revenue was largely in line with estimates, while profit beat expectations. Accenture raised its dividend by 15% to $1.12 per share and said it would buyback shares worth an additional $3 billion.

Communications regulator Ofcom also said on Thursday it would examine other digital markets over the next year, including messaging services such as WhatsApp, FaceTime and Zoom, and connected televisions and smart speakers.

It said if it concluded the cloud market was not working well it could recommendation policy changes, take enforcement action or ask the competition regulator to investigate.

It plans to publish a final report within 12 months, it said.

347,599,Microsoft,2022-09-23,Wall Street’s banking-as-a-service has a problem,"













NEW YORK, Sept 23 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Call it banking-as-a-service. The rise in deals done by private equity firms, accounting for $553 billion of M&A so far in 2022, per Refinitiv, generates lucrative fees for investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS.N). But that isn’t just from one deal. The nature of the buyout business means there are asset flips, equity offerings, follow-ons, and recapitalizations that all generate recurring fees. That depends on healthy capital markets, but amid debt-market snafus and falling equity values, this could be another subscription-like business wounded by the downturn.

Private equity clients are ideal for investment banks that otherwise have to schmooze large companies like Microsoft (MSFT.O) for years before receiving a one-off deal. Firms like Apollo Global Management (APO.N) and Blackstone have generated fees of $6.5 billion so far this year, a 44% jump compared to the same time last year.

It helps, too, that they create new business streams that keep paying. A leveraged buyout of a Midwestern, family-owned industrial firm might provide the first mandate. Then there are bolt-on acquisitions to grow the company, capital markets-funded dividends, and an eventual sale. If that exit is to another sponsor, the gravy train continues. Such sponsor-to-sponsor transactions were up 85% year-over-year in 2021, making them the second-most-common form of exit, according to data from Bain.

Still, fees from capital-markets work— raising the piles of debt sponsors rely on, or completing initial public offerings — are key to the proposition, and that could be in trouble. Global equity issuance is down 67% in the first half year-over-year, per Refinitiv. Banks took $700 million in losses to offload loans supporting the sponsor-led purchase of Citrix Systems (CTXS.O) this week, Reuters reported. A bunch of other debt packages are stuck on banks’ balance sheets — and until they’re cleared, banks’ ability to write further big checks is constrained.

Economic uncertainty makes people – and investors – become more discerning about how they spend their cash. Subscriptions, whether it is Netflix (NFLX.O) or to a favored investment banker, only makes sense when customers are flush. For Goldman and its brethren, life may be about to get harder as belts tighten.

348,778,Microsoft,2022-09-23,Review: Tencent reflects China’s blunted tech edge,"













HONG KONG, Sept 23 (Reuters Breakingviews) - To many foreigners, Chinese innovation has negative connotations. The People’s Republic was long known for churning out cheap manufactured goods, while spawning corporate copycats which took full advantage of the country’s vast market, domestic protectionism, and a relative lack of intellectual property rights. Over the last decade, the rise of internet giants like Tencent (0700.HK) exposed the flimsiness of the stereotype. The problem is that they became so powerful they drew Beijing’s ire.

“Influence Empire: Inside the Story of Tencent and China’s Tech Ambition” by Lulu Yilun Chen tracks the company’s evolution into a $350 billion social media and gaming behemoth. What started as a Chinese replica of ICQ, an instant chat platform invented by five Israelis, is now WeChat, a superapp that offers news, music, games, videos and payments and is used by more than 1.2 billion people. Its features were often far ahead of American rivals. According to Chen, Tencent staff mocked Facebook’s business model: “When you have a billion users, the last thing you should be thinking about is how do I sell them a ton of ads.”

To fend off competitors, Tencent and its Chinese rivals constantly implemented small innovations. Chen recounts a showdown with Hong Kong-based startup TalkBox, a WhatsApp-like service that invented a voice messaging function. Tencent judged that the most important factor was the speed at which the voice chats could be sent, not their quality. It turned out to be a crucial decision that eventually cost TalkBox.

Tencent founder Pony Ma nurtured star executives like former Goldman Sachs banker Martin Lau and Microsoft (MSFT.O) veteran Jeff Xiong Minghua. They instilled Western-style governance and helped engineer bold expansions, leaving Chinese state champions far behind in exploiting internet and fintech innovations. Tencent became the crown jewel of China's private sector. Investors who bought shares at the time of its Hong Kong initial public offering in 2004 had by late 2020 earned a whopping annualised return of 51%, according to Refinitiv.

As in the West, however, the growth of giant tech companies drew a backlash from Chinese regulators. In China, the turning point came in October 2020 when Jack Ma, the outspoken founder of rival internet giant Alibaba (9988.HK), lectured senior Chinese leaders about how their regulations were obsolete and stiff. A regulatory crackdown ensued, scuppering the planned $35 billion IPO of Ant, Alibaba’s financial affiliate.

By comparison, Pony Ma kept a lower profile and doggedly complied with rules. Nevertheless, Tencent could not avoid the backlash. Authorities found fault with the company’s lucrative games, labelling them as the “spiritual opium” enslaving the country’s youth. They ordered Tencent to cap the amount of playing time for minors. This month, authorities approved its first new game since last year.

The ferocity of the crackdown may also have reflected nervousness among China’s leaders about the company’s potential power. According to unnamed sources quoted by Chen, a Bloomberg journalist, now-disgraced Public Security Vice Minister Sun Lijun asked Tencent to monitor some of the country’s most influential politicians. Last year the Communist Party expelled Sun for “cultivating personal power” and he pled guilty to taking bribes. Tencent declined to comment.

The company’s fall from grace has had severe consequences for investors. Tencent shares have dropped by 60% since a February peak in 2021, erasing nearly $600 billion of market value. The backlash also undermined confidence in China’s private tech sector. U.S. venture capital investment has dwindled, and even Chinese tech investors are now venturing abroad.

The humbling of China’s privately owned internet giants contrasts with Xi Jinping’s push for technological self-sufficiency. The Chinese president is pouring state investment into semiconductors and other high-tech industries, where the country still lags the United States. But, as Chen argues, an environment where corporate success could be viewed as a threat to political stability hardly encourages risk-takers to blaze new trails. Indeed, the generation of Chinese entrepreneurs inspired by Silicon Valley’s startup culture have mostly retired or disappeared from public view, while selling their investments and donating to public causes to reduce their perceived influence.

Pony Ma has so far not followed peers like Jack Ma and Pinduoduo's (PDD.O) Colin Huang in stepping aside. According to local media, he told staff at an internal meeting last year that the company should ensure it “doesn’t overstep, be a good assistant” while serving the country. A humbled Tencent bodes ill for China replicating its past tech successes.

349,128,Microsoft,2022-09-27,Space and Time valued at $300 mln after Microsoft venture arm-led fundraise,"













Sept 27 (Reuters) - Space and Time, a decentralized data analytics platform, secured $20 million in funding from a group of investors led by Microsoft venture capital arm M12, valuing the company at $300 million.

The company, which aims to run analytics on data stored on blockchain as well as outside of it for smart contracts, plans to use the funding to hire more engineers, said Nate Holiday, co-founder, Space and Time.

""There is massive amounts of data and use cases coming from blockchain technology's multi-chain world, and insights and data from centralized data stores ... and Space and Time sits at the bridge that links them,"" Holiday said.

Space and Time is currently testing its technology with Web3 gaming platforms, Holiday added. Web3 is a term used to refer to a utopian, decentralized version of the internet.

The company also said it would integrate with Microsoft's Azure, that would allow customers of the cloud-computing business to access, manage and perform analytics on blockchain-stored data.

Space and Time plans to launch an alpha version of its product by the end of this year, a beta launch in Spring of 2023, and expects the product to go live in the fall of 2023, Holiday said.

The Newport Beach, California-based firm, founded as a part of Chainlink Labs' startup program, raised $10 million in seed funding in July.

The latest funding round also saw participation from Framework Ventures, HashKey, Polygon, Blizzard the Avalanche Fund, and Coin DCX, among others.

Sept 27 (Reuters) - Canada's BlackBerry Ltd (BB.TO), on Tuesday reported a fall in cybersecurity revenue for the second quarter, as customers reined in spending due to an uncertain macroeconomic environment, sending its shares down about 3% in extended trading.

The company has also been facing tough competition from Microsoft Corp , Citrix Systems (CTXS.O) and International Business Machines (IBM.N) in the security software segment, with revenue in the unit falling 7.5% to $111 million from a year ago.

The company said in an earnings call that cybersecurity segment revenue in the third quarter is expected to be flat year-on-year.

However, revenue at the company's Internet of things (IoT) unit, which includes the QNX software for automotive customers, rose about 28% to $51 million as it signed up more customers.

BlackBerry's QNX software is now embedded in over 215 million vehicles worldwide, helped by surging demand for electric vehicles and connected-car technologies. The company recently added global carmakers such as Ford Motor (F.N), General Motors (GM.N), Hyundai Motor (005380.KS), to its already strong client list of BMW (BMWG.DE), Honda Motor (7267.T), Mercedes-Benz (MBGn.DE) and Toyota Motor (7203.T).

BlackBerry in June said that a deal to sell its patents primarily related to mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking for $600 million to a special purpose vehicle has been delayed. read more

Total revenue fell 4% to $168 million for the quarter ended Aug. 31, compared with a consensus estimate of $166.7 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Excluding items, the company posted a loss of 5 cents per share, narrower than analysts' expectations of loss of 7 cents.

NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters) - A nearly $16 billion JP Morgan fund is expected to reset its options positions on Friday, potentially adding to equity volatility at the end of a gloomy quarter for stocks.

Analysts have in the past pointed to the JPMorgan Hedged Equity Fund’s quarterly reset roiling markets, and see it as a source of potential volatility during Friday's session. read more

WHAT IS THE JP MORGAN HEDGED EQUITY FUND?

The JPMorgan Hedged Equity Fund holds a basket of S&P 500 (.SPX) stocks along with options on the benchmark index and resets hedges once a quarter. The fund, which had about $15.59 billion in assets as of September 28, aims to let investors benefit from equity market gains while limiting their exposure to declines.

For the year, the fund was down 10.66% through September 28, compared with a 21% decline for the S&P 500 Total return Index (.SPXTR).

The fund's assets ballooned in recent years, as investors sought protection from the sort of wild swings that rocked markets in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020.

Its holdings include some of the market's biggest names, such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com Inc .

HOW DOES THE FUND USE OPTIONS?

The fund uses an options strategy that seeks to protect investors if the S&P 500 falls between 5% and 20%, while allowing them to take advantage of any market gains in the average range of 3.5-5.5%. On June 30, the refresh of the fund's options positions involved about 140,000 S&P 500 options contracts in all, including S&P 500 puts at strikes 3580 and 3020 and calls at 4005, all for the September 30 expiry.

HOW CAN THIS AFFECT THE BROADER MARKET?

Options dealers - typically big financial institutions that facilitate trading but seek to remain market-neutral - take the other side of the fund's options trades.

To minimize their own risk, they typically buy or sell stock futures, depending on the direction of the market's move. Such trading related to dealer hedging has the potential to influence the broader market, especially if done in size, as is the case for the JPM trade.

The trade is ""well understood"" and ""mostly digested by the market,"" said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group.

It has, however, exacerbated daily moves in the past, according to some analysts.

The S&P 500 Index (.SPX) fell 1.2% in the last hour of trading on March 31 amid a lack of any obvious news - a move some analysts pinned on options hedging flows. read more

Analysts say the refresh could exacerbate market swings on Friday, as the fund rolls over its options positions and dealers buy and sell futures to hedge their exposure.

""That's because there is a fair amount that has to be adjusted and hedged to roll the trade,"" said Brent Kochuba, founder of analytic service SpotGamma.

""I believe that the position is expanding volatility this week,"" Kochuba said.

All else being equal, once the options position is rolled forward three month out, their influence on current price swings should diminish, he said.

REUTERS/Costas Baltas















ATHENS, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Google will set up its first cloud region in Greece, the company said on Thursday, giving a boost to the country's efforts to become a world cloud computing hub.

The deal is estimated to contribute some 2.2 billion euros ($2.13 billion) to Greece's economic output and create some 20,000 jobs by 2030, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said.

Since taking office in 2019, Mitsotakis's conservative government has stepped up moves to diversify the economy and attract foreign investment and high tech companies to the country which emerged from a decade-long financial crisis in 2018.

""Today, we are very pleased to be announcing our first cloud region in Greece which will provide storage and cloud services for Google customers,"" said Adaire Fox-Martin, president of Google Cloud International, announcing the investment at an event in Athens.

The investment would enable organisations to better use their data, help improve low latency and ensure users' security in the face of cybersecurity threats, she said.

A cloud region usually is based around a cluster of data centres.

Google's investment comes two years after Microsoft Corp. decided to build a data centre hub in the country.

Amazon Inc's cloud computing division also opened its first office in Greece last year to support what it said was a growing number of companies and public sector agencies using its cloud services.

354,402,Microsoft,2022-09-30,Disney names Carolyn Everson to board in deal with activist investor Third Point,"













Sept 30 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) on Friday announced a truce with activist investor Third Point, saying it would appoint tech and media veteran Carolyn Everson to the board with the support of the shareholder.

The hedge fund, led by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, said in August it planned to push the entertainment and media conglomerate to make a string of changes, from spinning off cable sports channel ESPN to buying back shares and adding new board members. read more

However, Third Point reached an agreement with Disney on Friday to not present any proposal at any stockholder meeting until 2024, as long as Everson remains on the board, and to vote in accordance with the board's recommendations.

The activist shareholder also agreed to not raise its stake in the company to over 2% and to vote in favor of the slate of directors nominated by Disney's board.

Third Point did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Loeb had exited his position in the company, known for its theme parks and movies like ""Aladdin"" and ""Frozen"", months earlier when fears about rising prices and faster interest rate hikes sparked a sharp market selloff, before re-investing nearly $1 billion in the company in August for a 0.4% stake.

Chief Executive Bob Chapek, who confirmed reports there were enquiries made to buy ESPN, told Reuters earlier this month he believes the sports television network is an asset to the company. read more

Everson, 50, who is on Coca-Cola's (KO.N) board, has worked with Meta Platforms' (META.O) Facebook where she ran the global marketing and ad sales team for the social media giant.

Most recently, Everson was president of Instacart and her career has included leadership roles at Microsoft Corp and at Viacom, now part of Paramount Global (PARA.O).

Summary Companies S&P 500 notches largest September percentage drop in 20 years

All three major U.S. stock indexes post three-quarter slumps

Core inflation data hotter than expected

Indexes down: Dow 1.71%, S&P 1.51%, Nasdaq 1.51%















NEW YORK, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 closed the books on its steepest September decline in two decades on Friday, skidding across the finish line of a tumultuous quarter fraught with historically hot inflation, rising interest rates and recession fears.

All three major indexes veered to a sharply lower end, having quashed a brief rally early in the session.

The S&P and the Dow notched their third consecutive weekly declines, and all three indexes posted their second straight monthly losses.

In the first nine months of 2022, Wall Street suffered three quarterly declines in a row, the longest losing streak for the S&P and the Nasdaq since 2008 and the Dow's longest quarterly slump in seven years.

""It's another ugly day to end an ugly quarter in what’s looking like a very ugly year,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group in Omaha, Nebraska. ""Investors will look back and realize this was the year the Fed pulled a total 180 on their views on inflation and quickly turned incredibly hawkish.""

The Federal Reserve has rattled markets by engaging in its most relentless series of interest rate hikes in decades in order to rein in stubbornly high inflation, which has many market participants eyeing key economic data for signs of a looming recession.

""The realization that the Fed is doing anything they can to combat 40-year-high inflation has investors worried they will push the economy over the edge and into recession,"" Detrick added.

The Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures (PCE) report did little to assuage those fears, showing that while consumers continue to spend, the prices they are paying have accelerated, drifting further beyond the Fed's inflation target and all but ensuring the central bank's hawkish monetary policy will continue longer than investors had hoped.

Recession fears also echoed through dire warnings from Nike Inc (NKE.N) and cruise operator Carnival Corp (CCL.N), both citing inflation-related margin pressures. read more read more

Shares of the companies tanked by 12.8% and 23.3%, respectively.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 500.1 points, or 1.71%, to 28,725.51; the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 54.85 points, or 1.51%, to 3,585.62; and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 161.89 points, or 1.51%, to 10,575.62.

Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, real estate (.SPLRCR) was the sole gainer, while utilities (.SPLRCU) tech (.SPLRCT) suffered the largest percentage losses.

Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp , Amazon.com and Nike weighed heaviest.

Corporate earnings reports for the quarter that ends with Friday's closing bell will begin landing in a few weeks, and analyst expectations are trending downward.

Analysts now see annual S&P 500 earnings growth of 4.5%, on aggregate, down from the 11.1% estimate when the quarter began.

Quarter-end fund reallocations and so-called ""window dressing"" is likely contributed to the session's volatility.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.45-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.38-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 93 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 27 new highs and 380 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.44 billion shares, compared with the 11.45 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

BRUSSELS, Sept 30 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators will decide by Nov. 8 whether to clear Microsoft Corp's proposed $69 billion acquisition of ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O), according to a European Commission filing on Friday.

The deal, the biggest in the gaming industry, will help the U.S. software company better compete with leaders Tencent (0700.HK) and Sony (6758.T).

The EU competition enforcer can clear the deal with or without remedies after its preliminary review, or it can open a four-month long investigation if it has serious concerns.

The Commission is likely to do the latter because of recent regulatory concerns over deals by Big Tech, sources familiar with the matter said.

""The European Commission's review of the deal is progressing in line with the expected regulatory schedule and process, and we remain confident that the acquisition will close in fiscal year 2023,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said.

Britain's antitrust watchdog earlier this month said it would open an in-depth investigation into the bid after Microsoft declined to offer concessions during its initial review.

Oct 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street's three major indexes rallied to close over 2% on Monday as U.S. Treasury yields tumbled on weaker-than-expected manufacturing data, increasing the appeal of stocks at the start of the year's final quarter.

The U.S. stock market has suffered three quarterly declines in a row in a tumultuous year marked by interest rate hikes to tame historically high inflation, and concerns about a slowing economy.

""The U.S. yield markets (are) pulling back - that's been a positive ... and that connotes a more risk-on environment,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth in Boston.

Further supporting rate-sensitive growth stocks, the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield fell after British Prime Minister Liz Truss was forced to reverse course on a tax cut for the highest rate.

All 11 major S&P 500 (.SPX) sectors advanced to positive territory, with energy (.SPNY) being the biggest gainer.

Oil majors Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp rose more than 5%, tracking a jump in crude prices as sources said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are considering their biggest output cut since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Megacap growth and technology companies such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) rose over 3% respectively, while banks <.SPXBK> advanced 3%.

Data showed manufacturing activity increased at its slowest pace in nearly 2-1/2 years in September as new orders contracted, likely as rising interest rates to tame inflation cooled demand for goods. read more

The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing PMI dropped to 50.9 this month, missing estimates but still above 50, indicating growth.

""The economic data stream actually came in worse than expected. In a very counterintuitive fashion that likely represents good news for equity markets,"" said Hogan.

""(While) good economic data, strong readings had been a catalyst for selling, this is the first time we've actually seen some negative news be a catalyst.""

All three major indexes ended a volatile third quarter lower on Friday on growing fears that the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policy will tip the economy into recession.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 765.38 points, or 2.66%, to 29,490.89; the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 92.81 points, or 2.59%, at 3,678.43; and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 239.82 points, or 2.27%, at 10,815.44.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.61 billion shares, compared with the 11.54 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) fell 8.6% after it sold fewer-than-expected vehicles in the third quarter as deliveries lagged way behind production due to logistic hurdles. Peers Lucid Group (LCID.O) gained 0.9% and Rivian Automotive (RIVN.O) fell 3.1%. read more

Major automakers are expected to report modest declines in U.S. new vehicle sales, but analysts and investors worry that a darkening economic picture, not inventory shortages, will lead to weaker car sales. read more

358,660,Microsoft,2022-10-04,"PlayStation eyes new investment for PC, mobile push","













TOKYO, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Sony Group Corp's (6758.T) gaming business is looking at fresh investment to bolster its push into PC and mobile, a senior executive said, as the PlayStation 5 maker competes for talent with deep-pocketed rivals and as industry dealmaking heats up.

""Further investments in areas that will strengthen the expansion on to PC, on to mobile and into live services, that's definitely a possibility for us,"" Hermen Hulst, head of PlayStation Studios, told Reuters in an interview without providing further detail.

Sony, whose studios are known for single player console games such as ""Spider-Man"" and ""God of War"", has outlined ambitious plans to release titles on PC and mobile and offer live service games, which provide continuous updated play.

The radical shift is reflected in its recent deals including the $3.6 billion acquisition of Bungie, the studio behind the multiplayer ""Destiny"" franchise, which Sony operates outside its PlayStation Studios network.

Other investments include the purchase of a minority stake in Japanese developer FromSoftware, whose action role playing game ""Elden Ring"" has sold more than 16.6 million units.

""You should think of collaborations on the game development side first and foremost, but it's also not unthinkable with our PlayStation Productions efforts that we explore opportunities,"" Hulst said of the FromSoftware investment.

Sony is producing a growing number of game adaptations, with this year's ""Uncharted"" movie grossing more than $400 million globally and a TV series based on ""The Last of Us"" franchise from its Naughty Dog studio launching on HBO next year.

Hulst, who is based in the Netherlands and took up his post in 2019, has overseen the growth of PlayStation Studios to 19 studios, with additions including Nixxes, which ports console games to PC, and mobile developer Savage Game Studios.

KEY DIFFERENTIATOR

Given the scope of the transformation targeted by the gaming business, analysts expect further dealmaking from Sony.

""I think that they're still going to add studios,"" said Serkan Toto, founder of the Kantan Games consultancy.

The strength of PlayStation's studio network has drawn praise as a key differentiator with Xbox maker Microsoft (MSFT.O), which is trying to buy Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O).

Sony gaming chief Jim Ryan has raised objection about the $69 billion mega-deal's potential impact on PlayStation users.

""If Sony can pull off what they did with single player experiences but (as) multiplayer experiences across platforms, on the PC, on consoles and maybe even on the phone, then all bets are off,"" said Toto, pointing to the success of online games such as Fortnite from Epic Games.

Sony's push on to other platforms comes as it has struggled to produce enough PlayStation 5 units due to supply chain snarls. Its in-house studios are also developing titles for the next generation PlayStation VR2 headset, due to launch early next year.

Such headsets, which have attracted investment from players including Facebook parent Meta (META.O), are yet to break through and become a primary method for playing games. Pricing for the device has not been announced.

While ""Horizon Forbidden West"", which launched in February, is ""an open world and that's not necessarily very suitable to a PSVR2 game,"" Sony is designing ""bespoke"" titles such as ""Horizon Call of the Mountain"" for the system, Hulst said.

Oct 4 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 index (.SPX) posted its biggest single-day rally in two years on Tuesday after softer U.S. economic data and Australia's smaller-than-expected interest rate hike stirred hope for less aggressive tightening by the Federal Reserve.

While labor demand remains fairly strong, U.S. job openings fell by the most in nearly 2-1/2 years in August in a sign the Fed's mission to tame inflation by hiking rates was working to slow the economy. read more

Earlier, the Reserve Bank of Australia surprised markets with a smaller-than-expected interest rate hike of 25 basis points. Its cash rate rose to a nine-year peak after six rate hikes in as many months in a tightening cycle other central banks are engaged in as well. read more

The RBA is the first major central bank to recognize that now is the time to slow down after aggressively raising rates this year, said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan.

""There's hope that the Federal Reserve at some point in the fourth quarter will say the same thing. Not stop raising interest rates, but just slow the pace,"" he said. ""That's what the market's kind of rallying on below the surface.""

Still, Fed Governor Philip Jefferson said inflation is the most serious problem facing the U.S. central bank and it ""may take some time"" to address. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said the central bank needs to deliver more rate hikes. read more read more

Rate-sensitive tech stocks rose as yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury fell for a second day in a row after the jobs data and RBA's surprise move. Valuations on tech and other growth stocks fall when their cost of capital rises.

It was the biggest one-day gain for the S&P 500 since May 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) and S&P 500 (.SPX) posted their biggest two-day rallies since April 2020.

The repercussions of higher rates will likely be reflected in corporate results when earnings season begins in two weeks, said Dennis Dick, founder and market structure analyst at Triple D Trading Inc.

""We're still in for a tougher time here. I do think this earnings season is going to not be good,"" he said. ""If one of the big guns warns that could end the rally rather quickly. This is just a relief really as opposed to the start of a new bull market.""

Oct 4 (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N) employees will have to come in to office twice a week, the company said on Tuesday, at a time when companies worldwide are adapting to hybrid working models.

Tech giants such as Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) opted for flexible working policies early on during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Peer Lyft (LYFT.O) in March shifted to a 'fully flexible' work option, allowing workers the choice of where to live and work.

Uber announced Tuesdays and Thursdays as ""anchor days"" where all non-remote employees must work from office globally, starting Nov. 1.

361,723,Microsoft,2022-10-05,Biochar: the 'black gold' for soils that is getting big bets on offset markets,"Summary Biochar is produced by burning biomass in the absence of oxygen. It is a charcoal-like substance that farmers have used for centuries as a soil improver and is also an efficient carbon sink.

Biochar cited as a promising carbon removal technology in new guidance from the Science Based Target initiative for companies in land use sector

Microsoft and Shopify among companies to buy CO2 removal certificates from Finnish offsetting platform Puro.earth, which sell as high as $200 a tonne

Verra has also published a methodology for biochar carbon removal credits















October 4 - Travelling through the Amazon in the 1540s, Spanish explorer Franciso de Orellana discovered a thriving agrarian civilisation with uniquely fertile soil. Today, the nutrient-rich terra preta (black earth) soils remain in the Amazon’s Xingu region, even if the inhabitants largely did not survive the conquistadors.

The key to these soils is biochar, a charcoal-like substance produced from burning biomass in the absence of oxygen, a process called pyrolysis. The ancient Amazonians are thought to have produced it by burying smouldering organic matter. Now biochar, often referred to as “black gold”, is a rising star of agricultural circular economies, using up waste residues that would previously have been burned or left to decompose, producing heat as a renewable source of energy, acting as a soil improver and pesticide, and as a food supplement to reduce methane emissions in cattle.

The icing on the cake is that biochar acts as a carbon sink, locking CO2 out of the atmosphere for hundreds of years. This has led to behemoths such as Microsoft and Shopify buying up biochar CORCs (CO2 removal certificates) from Finnish carbon off-setting platform puro.earth.

Biochar’s physical and chemical structure enables it to act as a sponge, retaining moisture, micro-organisms and important nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus as well as gases, including carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide.

All this has the potential to help the world’s estimated 525 million smallholder farmers, many of whom are struggling with depleted soils and drought. In studies, biochar has been shown to be of particular benefit in poor soils, making it of value where deforestation and monoculture cropping have depleted the earth.

HUSK, a social impact business operating in Cambodia, reports that farmers using its biochar are seeing improvements in crop yields. HUSK utilises rice husks, a by-product of processing the third-most produced crop in the world, and at 150 million tonnes a year globally, a massive potential source of biomass.

The concept of biochar is not new to farmers in Asia, who had been producing it for thousands of years. “The challenge is that farmers no longer have access to this biomass,” says HUSK chief executive and cofounder Heloise Buckland. “The rice husk ends up being piled up in one place at the industrialised rice mills. And farmers buy synthetic fertilisers, which further degrade their soils.”

The company currently operates out of Cambodia’s largest organic rice mill. Two continuous pyrolysis units turn the husk into biochar, which is mixed with nutrients, compost and other other rice sector by-products. With 10,000 tonnes of rice husk produced by just one mill, the company is currently using just 8% of the available biomass to create 600 tonnes of its carbon-based range of fertilisers every year. These organic fertilisers are sold to farmers at a competitive price of $400 to $500 a tonne via a network of agricultural cooperatives and input distributors across the country. The company is also piloting a “super farmers network” for women, who earn extra income by selling the products door to door and earning a commission.

In trials HUSK has carried out over the last three years, farmers are seeing a positive return on investment of between 15% and 25% from a combination of higher yields and a reduction in the need for fertiliser, the price of which has doubled since 2020. Cambodian soil is in a “desperately bad state”, says Buckland, citing a culture of intensive crop cycles and over dependence on synthetic fertilisers. “However, the increase in fertiliser prices has had a significant impact on farmers, and once you can offer a competitive product, farmers know it makes sense to invest in long-term soil improvement.”

Soil improvement is one of the steps in a pioneering circular initiative in South Australia, which is using pyrolysis to produce heat for the glasshouse of Tantanoola-based Holla-Fresh, which produces hydroponically grown culinary herbs. The ECHO2 unit, supplied by technology provider Rainbow Bee Eater, creates clean syngas from timber and agricultural residues that are usually burned or left to decompose in land fills, generating CO2 emissions. The company installed its first ECHO2 commercial module at Holla-Fresh in 2018, and the biochar that results from the process is sold back to farmers as a soil improver by Bio Gro, a local agricultural solutions provider, which also supplies the Holla-Fresh unit with its biomass.

Rainbow Bee Eater has a second project coming on stream in 2023, with six ECHO2 units that will power greenhouses growing tomatoes and capsicums at Katunga Fresh in Victoria, Australia. Peter Burgess, managing director of Rainbow Bee Eater, says he has identified 100 projects that can benefit from similar collaborations.

The problem has been obtaining finance for further developments due to the novelty of the technology. This is where carbon credits are changing the landscape. An ECHO2 module operating 24 hours a day has the capacity to remove approximately 5,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) per year, one of the reasons it is one of the projects chosen by Shopify and Microsoft, who have both invested in CO2 removal certificates (CORCs) based on puro.earth’s puro standard, which has developed a methodology for biochar.

Speaking in a video interview with puro.earth, Burgess said: “The difficulty for us as the creator of these projects is getting finance. If puro.earth can enable forward contracts … we can then take that to a financier maybe even a bank and that will enable us to finance the project. It’s that simple. Most of (these projects) won’t happen without this sort of encouragement.”

Buckland at HUSK describes carbon credits as “a total game changer”. “We certified with the EBC (European Biochar Certificate) in 2019 and started selling the credits at $30 a tonne. Within one year, we tripled that. We've now sold at $200 a tonne and we are sold out until the last quarter of 2023. So, there’s a huge demand.”

She welcomed the methodology for biochar published by global standards body Verra in August. “(Verra) is a global standard and people will recognise and trust that, and I think that will really help to inject more finance into the biochar sector.""

HUSK plans to scale operations in Cambodia, with a roadmap to replicate further afield in Egypt and South America, and the eventual aim of putting 1 million tonnes of carbon back into the soil by 2025. Carbon credits will also enable HUSK to keep prices of its core product low. “Our end consumers are so price sensitive… we can't add $0.50 onto a kilo of biochar because they won't be able to afford it. These are people earning $5 a day,” she says.

""Effectively the income (from credits) enables us to put the carbon into an organic based fertiliser … So in terms of additionality, for us, it really is a very significant part of our business model.”

The potential for carbon removals technologies such as biochar to help meet corporate climate commitments in the land use sector is stressed by the Science Based Targets Initiative in newly published guidance. The Ithaka Institute, a Swiss-based open-source network for carbon strategies, has been partnering with chocolate producer Barry Callebaut to trial the production of biochar on cocoa farms using agricultural residues. Around 100 “champion farmers” in Ghana and Indonesia are making biochar using technology developed by Ithaka, and are also being taught to build their own efficient pyrolysis units out of earth.

Geza Toth, an independent consultant at the Ithaka Institute, estimates that by 2025 tens of thousands of cocoa farmers could be participating. But, he says “you need to have the farmers buy in gradually, and you need to make sure that you incentivise the farmers”.

The biochar being produced by farmers in Ithaka’s trials has been awarded EBC certification. “These certificates are trading today at a very high price because these are permanent carbon sinks,” says Toth. “And the farmers in our model get all the benefits.”

Toth says these “carbon farmers” could make an extra $150 a hectare a year from the credits, a significant sum when Fairtrade estimates the average cocoa farmer earns less than $1 a day.

The farmers are further benefiting from increased yields from biochar application. Toth says cocoa farmers in Ghana report increased average yields of 30%, a substantial figure in a country where deforestation has wreaked havoc on soil quality. “In a well-managed plantation you can get up to two or three tonnes of cocoa per hectare, but in Ghana it is half a tonne,” says Toth.

For hundreds of years, farmers in west Africa had no say in how they wanted to do things, but this is changing

Toth warns biochar is not a panacea, and needs to be part of an integrated agroforestry system. “You need to have biomass, you need to plant trees.”

And because of variations in pH levels, not all biochar is suitable for all soils. Moreover, if misapplied or badly produced, the benefits of biochar can be lost.

Ultimately, though, Toth sees biochar as a potential disruptor. “For hundreds of years, farmers in west Africa had no say in how they wanted to do things, but this is changing. And if they want to produce even their own fertilisers, then tomorrow they may decide who they sell their cocoa to. They might even determine the price of cocoa… This is a disruptor.

362,108,Microsoft,2022-10-06,EU wants to know if Microsoft will block rivals after Activision deal,"













BRUSSELS, Oct 6 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are asking games developers whether Microsoft (MSFT.O) will be incentivised to block rivals' access to ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard's (ATVI.O) best-selling games, according to an EU document seen by Reuters.

EU antitrust regulators are due to make a preliminary decision by Nov. 8 on whether to clear Microsoft's proposed $69 billion acquisition of Activision.

The EU competition enforcer also asked if Activision's trove of user data would give the U.S. software giant a competitive advantage in the development, publishing and distribution of computer and console games, the EU document shows.

The planned acquisition, the biggest in the gaming industry, will help Microsoft better compete with leaders Tencent (0700.HK) and Sony (6758.T).

After its decision next month the European Commission is expected to open a four-month long investigation, underscoring regulatory concerns about Big Tech acquisitions.

Games developers, publishers and distributors were asked whether the deal would affect their bargaining power regarding the terms for selling console and PC games via Microsoft's Xbox and its cloud game streaming service Game Pass.

Regulators also wanted to know if there would be sufficient alternative suppliers in the market following the deal and also in the event Microsoft decides to make Activision's games exclusively available on its Xbox, its Games Pass and its cloud game streaming services.

They asked if such exclusivity clauses would reinforce Microsoft's Windows operating system versus rivals, and whether the addition of Activision to its PC operating system, cloud computing services and game-related software tools gives it an advantage in the video gaming industry.

They asked how important the Call of Duty franchise is for distributors of console games, third-party multi-game subscription services on computers and providers of cloud game streaming services.

The questionnaire, with about 100 questions, asked which of the rivals such as Nvidia's GeForce Now, Sony's Playstation, Google Stadia, Amazon Luna and Facebook Gaming could be considered the most attractive following the deal.

Respondents have until Oct. 10 to reply.

REUTERS/Francois Lenoir















WASHINGTON/BRUSSELS, Oct 7 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday signed an executive order to implement a European Union-United States data transfer framework announced in March that adopts new American intelligence gathering privacy safeguards.

The deal seeks to end the limbo in which thousands of companies found themselves after Europe's top court threw out two previous pacts due to concerns about U.S. surveillance.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters the executive order ""is the culmination of our joint effort to restore trust and stability to transatlantic data flows"" and ""will ensure the privacy of EU personal data.""

The framework addresses the concerns of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), which in July 2020 struck down the prior EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework as a valid data transfer mechanism under EU law.

European Commissioner for Justice Didier Reynders said he was ""quite sure"" there would be a fresh legal challenge, but he was confident that the pact met the demands of the court.

""We have a real improvement relative to the Privacy Shield.... It's totally different,"" he told Reuters in an interview. ""Maybe the third attempt will be the good one.""

The White House said ""transatlantic data flows are critical to enabling the $7.1 trillion EU-U.S. economic relationship"" and the framework ""will restore an important legal basis for transatlantic data flows.""

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Microsoft welcomed the executive order, but digital rights activist group Access Now and European consumer organization BEUC said it did not appear that people's rights were being sufficiently protected.

The White House said Biden's order bolstered current ""privacy and civil liberties safeguards"" for U.S. intelligence gathering and created an independent, binding multi-layer redress mechanism for individuals who believe their personal data was illegally collected by U.S. intelligence agencies.

Reynders said it would take about six months to complete a complex approval process, noting the previous system only had redress to an ombudsperson inside the U.S. administration, which the EU court rejected.

Biden's order adopts new safeguards on the activities of U.S. intelligence gathering, requiring they do only what is necessary and proportionate, and creates a two-step system of redress - first to an intelligence agency watchdog then to a court with independent judges, whose decisions would bind the agencies.

Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in March said the provisional agreement offered stronger legal protections and addressed the EU court's concerns.

Raimondo on Friday will transmit a series of letters to the EU from U.S. agencies ""outlining the operation and enforcement of the EU-U.S. data privacy framework"" that ""will form the basis for the European Commission's assessment in a new adequacy decision,"" she said.

Under the order, the Civil Liberties Protection Officer (CLPO) in the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence will investigate complaints and make decisions.

The U.S. Justice Department is establishing a Data Protection Review Court to independently review CLPO’s decisions. Judges with experience in data privacy and national security will be appointed from outside the U.S. government.

European privacy activists have threatened to challenge the framework if they did not think it adequately protects privacy. Austrian Max Schrems, whose legal challenges have brought down the previous two EU-U.S. data flow systems, said he still needed to analyze the package.

""At first sight it seems that the core issues were not solved and it will be back to the CJEU (EU court) sooner or later,"" he said.

364,254,Microsoft,2022-10-11,"Meta's new Quest Pro headset, mixing real and virtual worlds, makes debut","













Oct 11 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms (META.O) unveiled its Quest Pro virtual and mixed reality headset on Tuesday, marking a milestone for Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's break into the higher-end market for extended reality computing devices.

The headset, introduced at Meta's annual Connect conference, will hit shelves on Oct. 25 at a price of $1,500, and will offer consumers a way to interact with virtual creations overlaid onto a full-color view of the physical world around them.

The launch is an important step for Zuckerberg, who last year announced plans for the device - then called Project Cambria - at the same time that he changed his company's name from Facebook to Meta to signal his intention to refocus the social media giant into a company that operates a shared immersive computing experience known as the metaverse.

Zuckerberg has since poured billions of dollars into that vision. Reality Labs, the Meta unit responsible for bringing the metaverse to life, lost $10.2 billion in 2021 and has lost nearly $6 billion so far this year.

In a speech at the event, Zuckerberg, recorded partially in video and partially as an avatar, said he expects the blending of the physical and digital worlds to give rise to new uses for computing.

""You're going to see entirely new categories of things getting built,"" he said.

The Quest Pro features several upgrades over Meta's existing Quest 2 headset, which overwhelmingly dominates the consumer virtual reality market.

Most strikingly, it has outward-facing cameras that capture a sort of 3D livestream of the physical environment around a wearer, enabling mixed reality novelties like the ability to hang a virtual painting on a real-world wall or have a virtual ball bounce off a real table.

The Quest 2, by contrast, offers a more rudimentary grayscale version of this technology, called passthrough.

The Quest Pro feels lighter and slimmer than its predecessors, with thin pancake lenses and a relocated battery that sits at the back of the headset, distributing its weight more evenly while reducing overall bulk.

For fully immersive virtual reality, Meta has added tracking sensors to the Quest Pro that can replicate users' eye movements and facial expressions, creating a sense that avatars are making eye contact.

PITCHING PRODUCTIVITY

Meta is pitching the Quest Pro as a productivity device, aimed at designers, architects and other creative professionals.

In addition to offering its own Horizon social and workspace platforms, the company has also made virtual versions of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) work products like Word, Outlook and Teams available, a partnership Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella joined Zuckerberg to announce.

Matthew Ball, a venture capitalist whose writings about the metaverse have drawn Zuckerberg's praise, said he considered such partnerships significant because they suggested the companies' commitment to interoperability, or the idea that different systems should connect with each another.

""There is a lot of skepticism in the market as to whether an interoperable and open metaverse is even possible, let alone likely,"" he said, noting that Microsoft and Meta compete on several products in the extended reality space.

At a preview of Quest Pro days before its launch, Meta gave reporters a glimpse of the type of user it had in mind for its productivity pitch by showcasing apps like Tribe XR, a virtual training environment for DJs.

Tribe XR is already available in virtual reality, but a demonstration showed how passthrough technology may enable DJs to use the app to play real-world gigs, as it means they can look out past their virtual equipment at actual partygoers.

Meta plans to sell the Quest Pro in consumer channels to start, while adding enterprise-level capabilities like mobile device management, authentication and premium support services next year, executives said at the press event.

They said the device is intended to complement rather than replace the entry-level Quest 2, which sells for $399.99.

For now, that means the Quest Pro stops short of enabling the complex commercial applications Meta has suggested it wants its metaverse technology to support.

The company is still working on a mixed reality experience for its Horizon Workrooms app that would make a person's avatar appear to be present in a real-world conference room with other users, which it is calling Magic Rooms.

It is also planning to add legs to its avatars, which are currently displayed from the waist up, Zuckerberg said.

Still, the Quest Pro's price point puts it well under the cost of existing enterprise-focused devices like Microsoft's Hololens 2, which was released for commercial use in 2019 and is already present in operating rooms and on factory floors.

An entry-level Hololens 2 sells for $3,500.

AMSTERDAM, Oct 11 (Reuters) - A group of European telecom regulators does not support the idea of having big tech firms such as Google and Netflix paying for telecommunications infrastructure, it said in initial findings published on Tuesday.

The findings by the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) come as the European Commission is debating whether internet platforms should be obliged to fund digital infrastructure such as 5G telecoms networks, given they make heavy use of it.

""BEREC has found no evidence that such (a direct compensation) method is justified given the current state of the market,"" the BEREC conclusions said.

The telecommunications industry has argued Google, Netflix, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple should pay for a ""fair share"" of telecom infrastructure as their services make up more than half of internet traffic.

However, digital rights groups fear that if the big tech firms fund infrastructure, they will also strike deals with telecom firms to give their own traffic preferential treatment, undermining the principle of net neutrality.

In a reaction to the BEREC findings, telecom lobby group ETNO - the European Telecommunications Network Operators, which represents Deutsche Telekom, Orange Group, Telefonica and others - rejected the BEREC findings as outdated and said it would submit new evidence to the Commission to support its position.

BEREC's findings said the internet had proved resilient to changing traffic patterns in the past and following ETNO's proposals ""could be of significant harm"".

EU industry chief Thierry Breton has said the European Union will review the matter early in 2023.

REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz/File Photo















WASHINGTON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The White House rolled out a long-delayed national security strategy on Wednesday that seeks to contain China's rise while reemphasizing the importance of working with allies to tackle challenges confronting democratic nations.

The 48-page document, which was delayed by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, includes no major shifts in thinking and introduces no major new foreign policy doctrines. Instead, it highlights the view that U.S. leadership is the key to overcoming global threats like climate change and the rise of authoritarianism.

Even after Russia's invasion, China represents the most consequential challenge to the global order and the United States must win the economic arms race with the superpower if it hopes to retain its global influence, the strategy says.

""The People's Republic of China harbors the intention and, increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international order in favor of one that tilts the global playing field to its benefit, even as the United States remains committed to managing the competition between our countries responsibly,"" national security advisor Jake Sullivan said in outlining the policy.

He said Washington must manage the China relationship while dealing with transnational challenges including climate change, food insecurity, communicable diseases, terrorism, the energy transition, and inflation.

China's embassy in Washington did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

​Biden has yet to resolve some key foreign policy debates, including tariffs on Chinese goods established by his predecessor Donald Trump that cost U.S. importers billions, and faces new ones brought into high relief by Russia's actions, including fraying relations with long-time ally Saudi Arabia and India's reliance on Russian energy.

Sullivan echoed comments by Biden this week that the U.S. is ""reevaluating"" its relationship with Saudi Arabia after OPEC+ announced last week it would cut its oil production target over U.S. objections.

Daniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia under former President Barack Obama, said the strategy was consistent with Biden's stated priorities of domestic renewal, strengthening alliances and democratic institutions, and balancing cooperation and competition.

""However, during its 21-month gestation period, the strategy has clearly shifted to place overwhelming emphasis on competition with China,"" he said, noting that while it pledges to avoid looking at the world solely through the prism of strategic competition, ""competition with China suffuses every chapter.""

Russel said the paper pledged to build the broadest coalition of nations to address global challenges, but it would be difficult to do this without China and there was no indication how such cooperation might be secured.

A lone reference in the document to North Korea underscored limited U.S. options to contain its nuclear and missile programs.

This was striking, Russel said, ""not only because it passes so quickly past a persistent and existential threat, but also because it frames the strategy as 'seeking sustained diplomacy toward denuclearization,' when North Korea has so convincingly demonstrated its utter rejection of negotiations.""

The administration was supposed to have sent the strategy to Congress when it submitted its proposed budget on March 28.

The chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Jack Reed, welcomed of the release and noted that it ""recognizes that we must modernize and strengthen our military.""

""This will require smart investments in platforms and equipment, rapid development and integration of cutting-edge technologies,"" the Rhode Island Democrat said, adding that he looked forward to the Pentagon releasing an unclassified version of the National Defense Strategy.

Sullivan said the Ukraine crisis did delay but did not ""fundamentally alter"" Biden's foreign policy approach.

However, he added: ""I do believe that it presents in living color the key elements of our approach – the emphasis on allies, the importance of strengthening the hand of the democratic world, standing up for fellow democracies and for democratic values.""

367,556,Microsoft,2022-10-12,Metaverse could accelerate manufacturing as well as social ills,"













AUSTIN, Oct 12 (Reuters) - For companies playing with virtual reality as disparate as plane-maker Boeing Co (BA.N) and online-gaming platform Roblox Corp (RBLX.N), forays into the so-called ""metaverse"" have come with equal parts promise and peril.

The U.S. aviation giant is looking to digital technology to accelerate production of new aircraft, said Susan Doniz, Boeing's chief information officer, at the Reuters Momentum conference in Austin on Tuesday. She cited how Boeing cut the development time of the T-7 trainer jet by 80% to three years as an example of what might be possible for commercial airplanes.

Still, Doniz declined to offer a target date for when Boeing will design its next major plane digitally, a goal the company has discussed for years. Boeing has a commercial-order backlog of 4,354 aircraft.

Some employees expressed reluctance over tools Boeing offered to help them, too. The company deployed the HoloLens, mixed-reality headsets from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), so staff could wire aircraft with manuals before them digitally. The first-generation goggles had trouble with certain lighting conditions, and they were an adjustment for some, she said.

""There's a bit of a learning curve,"" she said.

Virtual reality is still nascent. The metaverse, not just a place where Boeing may one day build its planes, is a concept where people can have an avatar in vast virtual lands. There even is discussion about creating ""digital twins"" of the real world -- and its problems, said Morgan McGuire, Roblox's chief scientist.

""There's a lot of things in the real world that are really serious and are really bad,"" McGuire said at the conference. ""I don't want the haves and have nots. I don't want -- what's the digital equivalent of homelessness?""

Roblox's success attracting nearly 60 million daily users to play and build games on its site has not found a match however in Tinder, the Match Group Inc (MTCH.O) dating app that's taking a wait-and-see approach to the metaverse.

""We aren’t doing anything explicitly in the metaverse today, but we want to be the place you go when you want to meet somebody new, whether that is in the real world or the virtual world,"" Tinder Chief Operating Officer Faye Iosotaluno said at the conference.

Part of the challenge may be the technology is rudimentary. In the view of Renji Bijoy, chief executive of the virtual office company Immersed speaking at the Reuters conference Wednesday, ""this is more (like) Windows 95,"" he said.

368,88,Microsoft,2022-10-12,Cisco partners with Microsoft to add Teams to its meeting devices,"













Oct 12 (Reuters) - Networking firm Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO.O) will add Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT.O) Teams messaging app to its meeting devices, the two firms said on Wednesday, offering users an alternative to its own Webex video conferencing app.

Cisco's Jeetu Patel, head of Security & Collaboration, said the company aims to be the hardware platform for a wide range of conferencing software platforms.

""The way this market is evolving is very similar to the way that the movie entertainment market evolved,"" Patel said, with consumers having multiple subscriptions to streaming services like Netflix, Disney, HBO and Hulu.

""There's going to be times that people want to jump on a Microsoft Teams call, they want to jump on a Zoom call, they want to jump on a Google call.""

Asked whether the strategy could cannibalize market share for Cisco's Webex app, Patel said he believed the company will benefit if customers have a better experience using multiple platforms.

Webex, once a widely used conferencing platform, has lost out to several newcomers including Zoom Video Communications Inc (ZM.O), which was founded by an early Webex engineer and grabbed a large share of the market during the coronavirus pandemic.

Ilya Bukshteyn, vice president of Microsoft Teams Calling and Devices, told Reuters the Teams Room software already runs on several other hardware devices and will be available on Cisco devices from the first quarter of next year.

Microsoft made the announcement at its annual Ignite conference.

Patel conceded ""many people have a misconception of Webex as their granddad's software"" but said in the last two years Cisco has launched many new functions, including real-time translation and transcription of meetings, that would eventually allow a multi-language conversation through Webex's video platform.

BERLIN, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Mercedes-Benz (MBGn.DE) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) announced a partnership on Wednesday using Microsoft Cloud for a data platform intended to improve production efficiency at over 30 passenger car plants globally, the carmaker said on Wednesday.

The data platform, called MO360, is already available in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and will also be launched in the United States and China, the statement said.

The aim is to gather data from across the production process from components to logistics to the assembly line to create a virtual replica that allows teams to identify potential supply chain bottlenecks more quickly.

The collaboration should lead to a 20% increase in vehicle production efficiency by 2025 from 2022 levels, the statement added.

370,84,Microsoft,2022-10-12,Microsoft says UK influenced by Sony in probing Activision Blizzard deal,"













LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) said Britain's competition regulator had relied on objections from its rival Sony (6758.T) in referring its $69 billion Activision Blizzard deal to an in-depth inquiry, in particular ""misplaced"" concerns about 'Call of Duty'.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said last month that the acquisition could harm competition and needed to be investigated in depth.

Microsoft could use its control over popular games to harm rivals, including those operating in multi-game subscription services and cloud gaming, it said.

It was a ""game-changing merger"", it said in its full decision on Wednesday, which would give Microsoft best selling franchises including 'Call of Duty', 'World of Warcraft' and 'Candy Crush'.

""The CMA is concerned that having full control over this powerful catalogue (...) could result in Microsoft harming consumers by impairing Sony's — Microsoft's closest gaming rival— ability to compete,"" it said.

Microsoft said the CMA had adopted Sony's complaints without the ""appropriate level of critical review"".

In its submission, it said Sony's PlayStation had been the largest console platform for more than 20 years, and it was not credible to suggest its dominance would be challenged by losing access to one title.

""The Referral Decision incorrectly relies on self-serving statements by Sony which significantly exaggerate the importance of 'Call of Duty' to it and neglect to account for Sony's clear ability to competitively respond,"" Microsoft said.

It added that it had committed to keeping 'Call of Duty' on PlayStation.

""Our inquiry is about protecting competition in the interests of UK gamers and businesses. The Phase 1 decision identified three areas where the deal could cause harm: gaming consoles, multi-game subscription services and cloud gaming services,"" a CMA spokesperson said in a statement.

""We have now launched an in-depth investigation and our findings will be published in the New Year.""

A spokesperson for Microsoft said: ""This deal will benefit gamers, developers, and the industry as we seek to bring more games to more people.""

A spokesperson for Sony PlayStation reiterated its view that the deal was ""bad for competition, bad for the gaming industry and bad for gamers themselves"".

""This deal would give Microsoft's Xbox ecosystem a unique combination of tech and content, and hence a dominant position in gaming, with devastating consequences for consumers, independent developers, and Sony itself,"" he said.

The deal, which was announced in January, will require approval in the United States as well as other major jurisdictions including the European Union and China.

371,252,Microsoft,2022-10-13,Big Tech's hiring freeze unlocks rich talent pool for U.S. startups,"













Oct 13 (Reuters) - Late-stage U.S. startups are scooping up talent unlocked by layoffs and hiring freezes at Big Tech, adding experienced engineers and project managers to their roster despite signs of an economic slowdown.

Companies, with steady cash flow from viable products in the market, are offering rich pay checks to lure talent that would have otherwise preferred working at big technology firms including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Facebook-parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O).

Stack Overflow Chief Executive Prashanth Chandrasekar said the coding platform's headcount had more than doubled this year to 540, with some of the new hires being tapped from firms such as Alphabet Inc-owned (GOOGL.O) Google and Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

""When competitors downsize, other talented people who are employed there may consider looking elsewhere, as they may not see their company as being stable,"" Chandrasekar said.

Deepak Rao, CEO of X1 Card, said the credit-card startup's headcount had more than doubled to 35 in a year and more employees from larger companies would join it in the coming months.

Google, Apple, Microsoft and Meta and did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The hiring spree comes even as startup funding is drying up in the face of decades-high inflation, a stronger dollar and massive rate hikes, which have pushed Big Tech to pull back on their spending spree.

According to GlobalData, venture capital funding raised by U.S. startups fell by nearly a third to $146.3 billion in the first eight months of 2022.

""Tech startups reliant on ongoing VC funding have cut back on hiring, but companies in the later funding stages with viable products in the market are faring much better,"" said Patrick McAdams, CEO of recruiting firm Andiamo.

""These companies have continued to hire strategically and are now able to take advantage of a softening tech hiring market to make key hires that were nearly impossible this time last year (when the pandemic drove up demand for tech workers).""

A survey of 581 executives, almost entirely from U.S. tech startups, showed that more than 40% of them boosted their hiring plans in the first half of 2022, according to hiring firm A.Team and startup consultant MassChallenge.

Companies are also shortening hiring times and offering higher pay packages to lock in candidates as they compete for talent in a tight labor market, recruiters said.

A greater say in decision making provided by startups has also appealed to executives such as Mansoor Basha, who joined Stagwell (STGW.O), a $2.2 billion marketing firm, as technology chief in September from Accenture .

""An opportunity to make key decisions internally was important for me,"" he said.

Still, some analysts warn there is only so long until startups can continue the hiring pace amid a weak economic backdrop.

""If the economy does indeed go into recession, it will only add to the pressure faced by tech firms as demand dries up,"" says Dante DeAntonio, director of economics research at Moody's Analytics.

Oct 13 (Reuters) - Fintech startup Aspiration, backed by Hollywood celebrities Robert Downey Jr and Leonardo DiCaprio, on Thursday announced the appointment of Olivia Albrecht as its new Chief Executive Officer.

Albrecht, who joined the company earlier this year as Chief Sustainability Officer, succeeds Aspiration co-founder Andrei Cherny who served as CEO for nine years. Cherny will retain his position on the board, the company said in a statement.

Aspiration's leadership change comes as the company's merger with blank-check firm InterPrivate III Financial Partners Inc (IPVF.N) continues to be delayed.

Last year, InterPrivate said it would take the startup public in a deal valuing Aspiration at $2.3 billion. The merger, which was expected to be closed by the first quarter of 2022, is yet to be completed.

California-based Aspiration, which provides banking services, credit cards and investment products, had raised $315 million from funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management and affiliates of former Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) CEO Steve Ballmer late last year.

Law firms Related documents Verdict comes in first trial under tough Illinois privacy law

Drivers needed fingerprint scans to access facilities-lawsuits















(Reuters) - A jury has ordered freight railway giant BNSF Railway Co to pay $228 million to tens of thousands of truck drivers after finding the company collected the drivers' fingerprints without consent.

The verdict, handed Wednesday evening in Chicago federal court, came after the first trial under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), a state law which restricts collection of biometric data like fingerprints or retinal scans.

""We’re very pleased with the verdict and it shows that privacy is important and that companies must comply with the law, and will be held accountable if they don’t,"" said David Gerbie of McGuire Law, a lawyer for the plaintiffs.

The company said in a statement it believed the verdict ""reflects a misunderstanding of key issues"" and that it would appeal.

The class action was filed in 2019 by one driver, Richard Rogers, who said that BNSF required truck drivers to scan their fingerprints when picking up and dropping off loads at the company's Illinois facilities. Rogers said the practice violated Illinois' BIPA.

The class included 45,600 drivers. The verdict represents $5,000 per driver, the maximum allowed under the law.

The law, passed in 2008, is one of the toughest biometric privacy laws in the country, requiring companies to obtain written consent before collecting any biometric data.

Many companies have been sued under the law, including Amazon.com, Microsoft Inc and Facebook, which in 2020 agreed to pay $650 million to settle a class action accusing it of violating the law by storing users' facial geometry for a feature that automatically recognized people in photographs.

Fort Worth, Texas-based BNSF is owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. It operates one of the largest freight rail networks in the United States.

The case is Rogers v. BNSF Railway Company, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 1:19-cv-03083.

For plaintiffs: Jon Loevy of Loevy & Loevy, Myles McGuire and David Gerbie of McGuire Law, and others

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 14 (Reuters) - A newly discovered hacking group has attacked transportation and logistics companies in Ukraine and Poland with a novel kind of ransomware, Microsoft said in a blog post on Friday.

The attackers targeted a wide range of systems within an hour on Tuesday, Microsoft said, adding that it hadn't been able to link the attacks to any known group yet.

Notably, however, researchers found that the hacks closely mirrored earlier attacks by a Russian government-linked cyber team that had disrupted Ukraine government agencies.

Ukraine has been the target of numerous cyberattacks by Russia since the start of the conflict in late February, according to western security researchers and senior government officials.

The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and neither did the cybersecurity agencies of Ukraine or Poland.

Victims of the new ransomware, named ""Prestige,"" overlap with those of another data-shredding cyberattack that involved the ""FoxLoad,"" or ""HermeticWiper"" malware, Microsoft said.

That attack hit hundreds of computers in Ukraine, Lithuania, and Latvia at the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

""Prestige"" ransomware works by encrypting a victims' data and leaving a ransom note that says the data can only be unlocked with the purchase of a decryption tool, Microsoft said.

In several cases, the researchers noted that the hackers had gained administrator control of the victims' systems ahead of deploying the ransomware, suggesting they had stolen their credentials earlier and were waiting for the right moment.

""The enterprise-wide deployment of ransomware is not common in Ukraine, and this activity was not connected to any of the 94 currently active ransomware activity groups that Microsoft tracks,"" the researchers said.

LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Paintings by Paul Cezanne, Georges Seurat and Lucian Freud will go under the hammer next month in a sale of artworks from the estate of late Microsoft Corp co-founder Paul Allen that is expected to raise more than $1 billion for philanthropic causes.

Described as ""the sale of this century"" by auction house Christie's, the collection of more than 150 pieces spans 500 years of art history from Sandro Botticelli to David Hockney.

The star attractions are Cezanne's ""La Montagne Sainte-Victoire"" and Seurat's ""Les Poseuses, Ensemble (Petite Version)"", which carry price estimates of in excess of $120 million and $100 million respectively.

Christie's Global President Jussi Pylkkanen said he expected overall proceeds ""well in excess of $1 billion.""

Allen ""was a man who really understood the artworks and their individual significance,"" Pylkkanen told Reuters on Friday at a media preview in London, where some of the works are on public display for a few days.

Allen, who together with school friend Bill Gates started Microsoft in 1975 before leaving the software company several years later, died in 2018, aged 65.

Other highlights from his collection include Francis Bacon's ""Three Studies for Self-Portrait"" triptych with an estimate of $25 million, Freud's ""Large Interior, W11 (after Watteau)"" painting with a price tag of $75 million and Botticelli's ""Madonna of the Magnificat"", which could fetch more than $40 million.

Hockney's ""Queen Anne's Lace Near Kilham"" has a price estimate of $8 million-$12 million and Alberto Giacometti's sculpture ""Femme de Venise III"" $15 million-$20 million.

The collection will be sold in two parts in New York on Nov. 9-10 .

Summary Companies Q3 revenue, operating loss beat consensus

Q3 location technology revenue rises 14% to 108.3 mln euros

Cuts 2023 cash flow outlook, maintains revenue target

Raises 2022 outlook on revenue, cash flow

Shares down 12% at 1040 GMT; ING calls 2023 outlook 'cautious'















Oct 14 (Reuters) - Dutch navigation and digital mapping company TomTom (TOM2.AS) on Friday cut its cash flow target for 2023, citing inflationary pressures and economic uncertainty, sending its shares tumbling 12% despite better than expected third-quarter performance.

The Amsterdam-based group, whose customers range from major car companies to global tech firms, forecast free cash flow at break-even for next year, compared with a previous outlook for an inflow of at least 5% of revenues.

""High energy prices, high interest rates and inflation pressure give us quite a bit of uncertainty if we look at the mid term,"" Chief Executive Officer Harold Goddijn told Reuters.

TomTom, which counts Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Renault (RENA.PA) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) among its clients, has also been hit by the global chip shortage that has disrupted the automotive and electronics industries.

The group said the supply chain strains were easing but would continue to restrict production in the fourth quarter.

The increased car production and strong location technology sales drove the third-quarter revenue to 136.3 million euros ($132.6 million), above analysts' 126-million-euro estimate and up 7% on the year.

""We don't see disruption of the supply chain so much,"" Goddijn said, pointing to ""slightly higher"" production numbers in the quarter.

""So I think the direct impact of the war (in Ukraine) is limited,"" he said.

The company raised 2022 revenue outlook to 505-520 million euros, including 410-425 million from its core location technology business, against its previous guidance of 470-510 million in total revenue.

It expects free cash outflow of around 2% of the revenue this year, excluding the restructuring of its Maps unit.

""The beat is driven by automotive clients ramping up production volumes now that supply-chain issues ease. At the same time the company became more cautious on 2023,"" ING analyst Marc Hesselink says.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts















Oct 17 (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband sold call options in chipmakers Micron Technology (MU.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O) for a loss of under $1 million, according to a new transparency filing.

In a periodic transaction report dated Friday, the senior Democrat disclosed that her husband, financier Paul Pelosi, lost $392,575 in the sale of Micron call options he had purchased in December 2021. The report also showed he sold Nvidia call options bought in July 2021 for a loss of $361,476.

The same report also shows Paul Pelosi exercised 200 call options to buy shares of Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) in a transaction worth $2 million, while allowing call options in Walt Disney (DIS.N) to expire for a loss of $132,824.

All of those events occurred on Sept. 16, according to the transaction report.

Paul Pelosi frequently trades shares of companies popular with many investors, including Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and other tech companies.

A 2012 law makes it illegal for lawmakers to use information from their work in Congress for their personal gain. The law requires them to disclose stock transactions by themselves or family members within 45 days.

Senior House Democrats have yet to allow a vote on legislation restricting members of Congress and other government officials from trading stocks. Such legislation has been introduced in response to allegations that some lawmakers may have taken advantage of their positions for personal gain.

Pelosi initially voiced skepticism of changes to the current law, but later allowed legislation to advance toward consideration by the chamber.

In July, Paul Pelosi sold Nvidia shares days before the House approved legislation providing subsidies and tax credits worth over $70 billion to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry.

An analysis by Unusual Whales, a service selling financial data, concluded that congressional lawmakers last year traded $290 million in stocks, options, cryptocurrency and other assets, and that they outperformed the market, on average.

Summary Companies Goldman Sachs benefits from higher interest rates

Lockheed surges after quarterly results

Salesforce climbs after Starboard Value takes stake

Dow up 1.12%, S&P 500 up 1.14%, Nasdaq up 0.90%















NEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher for a second straight day on Tuesday as solid quarterly results from Goldman Sachs and Lockheed Martin lessened worries of a weak earnings season.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) gained 2.33% after reporting a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly profit as a boost in net interest income cushioned the blow from a slowdown in investment banking.

The investment bank, which is reorganizing its business into three units, largely closed out earnings from major financial firms on a largely positive note, even though several lenders raised the loan loss provisions in anticipation of troubled times ahead.

Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) shot up 8.69% after the weapons maker posted stronger-than-expected quarterly revenue and maintained its 2022 revenue view. The gains helped lift the S&P industrials index (.SPLRCI) as the best performing of the 11 major sectors.

""The banks were good... we’ll see if some of the other ones, more of the consumer sensitive ones, can they pass through their cost increases, have they stopped passing them though, but yeah people are hoping for better,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.

""We need to see more of the earnings data, we need to see more of the data that will knock down inflation and then you can maybe get your rally going, until then I think everybody would say treat all rallies as suspect.""

Analysts now expect quarterly earnings growth for S&P 500 companies of just 2.8% from a year ago, much lower than an 11.1% increase expected at the start of July, according to Refinitiv data.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 337.98 points, or 1.12%, to 30,523.8, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 42.03 points, or 1.14%, to 3,719.98 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 96.60 points, or 0.9%, to 10,772.40.

Also providing a boost was a 4.31% rise in Salesforce Inc shares after a media report that activist investor Starboard Value LP has picked up stake in the enterprise software firm.

Stocks briefly pared gains late in the session after a report that Apple (AAPL.O) was cutting production of its iPhone 14 Plus just weeks after starting shipments, before shares of the tech giant recovered and ended the session up 0.94%.

Signs the U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hike path may be starting to crimp the labor market were beginning to appear. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), was little changed after a report it was laying off under 1,000 employees this week, becoming the latest U.S. technology company to cut jobs or slow hiring amid a global economic slowdown.

The Fed's path has left many investors worried it could tilt the economy into a recession by making a policy mistake and raising rates too much. Fed officials have largely been in sync in comments about the need for the central bank to tamp down inflation.

A report said ratings agency Fitch has slashed U.S. growth forecasts for this year and next and was set to warn that the Fed's interest rate hikes and inflation will drive the economy into a 1990-style recession.

But economic data on Tuesday indicated the manufacturing sector remains on reasonable footing despite the Fed's efforts, although they appear to be sharply weighing on the housing market.

Netflix (NFLX.O) lost 1.73% ahead of its earnings report after the market close, with all eyes on the video-streaming company's subscriber growth, which is seen falling in the third quarter. But its shares surged 14.49% after the closing bell as it reversed subscriber declines.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.67 billion shares, compared with the 11.62 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.70-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.90-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 3 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 80 new highs and 102 new lows.

379,490,Microsoft,2022-10-18,"Investment in cloud firms plunged 42% in Q3, says venture capitalist Accel","













STOCKHOLM, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The amount of money invested in private cloud-computing companies in Europe, Israel and the United States dropped 42% in the third quarter of 2022, indicating an industry in the midst of a ""reset"", showed a report from venture capital firm Accel.

While 51 cloud software developers raised funds at valuations of over $1 billion in the first quarter of 2022, only three did so in the third quarter, Accel's 2022 Euroscape report showed.

The valuation of publicly listed cloud companies has also dropped to $1.2 trillion from $2.8 trillion in the last 12 months, Accel said.

Valuations have dropped at software firms as varied as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Shopify Inc (SHOP.TO) and across areas such as data analytics, security and collaboration.

Among software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies, U.S. data analytics software maker Snowflake Inc (SNOW.N) has the highest enterprise value-to-revenue multiple over the next 12 months. Last month, however, the multiple was 20 times versus 61 times in September last year, the report showed.

""After several explosive years of growth, it's clear that a major reset is underway... Rising interest rates and climbing inflation has led to contracted software valuations,"" said Philippe Botteri, a partner at Accel.

""But we firmly believe that strong secular trends, like the shift to cloud, will continue to propel European and Israeli SaaS forward.""

Still, the migration of local software operations to the cloud has not lost momentum and spending on automation and digital transformation is likely to rise to $2.8 trillion by 2025 from $1.8 trillion in 2022, Accel said.

Companies' low valuations also increase the potential for mergers and acquisitions, with software deals likely to reach $101 billion on an annualised basis this year, it said.

There is around $770 billion available to buy cloud companies, with $440 billion of cash on the balance sheets of strategic investors and $330 billion of dry powder from technology-focused private equity funds, Accel estimated.

380,178,Microsoft,2022-10-18,ValueAct's Morfit sees Insight Enterprises stock surging as cloud computing grows,"













NEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Insight Enterprises Inc (NSIT.O), which helps clients with the critical but largely unsung work of digital transformation, is poised for a dramatic stock price jump as its revenue stream becomes more predictable, investment firm ValueAct's chief executive said.

Mason Morfit, the firm's chief executive and chief investment officer, said the company's stock price, currently trading at $87.63, could climb to as high as $500 a share in the next five years.

""We find companies that have the opportunity to transform into global champions by becoming better aligned with the mega trends in the economy, whether that's cloud computing, streaming television, or medical technologies, and the list goes on and on,"" Morfit said during a presentation at the 13D Monitor Active-Passive Investor Summit.

The company has a healthy business and works in the growing cloud computing segment, two factors that should help distinguish it, he said, adding that Insight trades around 10 times earnings and generates a 9% free cash flow yield with growth in the high teens. This ""presents a great return opportunity without any multiple expansion,"" he said.

ValueAct, which traditionally owns roughly a dozen companies and distinguishes itself from other activists by preferring to stay behind the scenes, rarely presents its investment ideas publicly. Morfit said he was speaking out about Insight because it is broadly overlooked by the market.

It is not widely covered by Wall Street analysts and has been lumped with companies like DXC Technology (DXC.N) rather than Accenture Plc (ACN.F) which is a more appropriate peer, he said.

As Insight helps transform its partner companies, it is also transforming itself having hired a new chief executive earlier this year and having changed the bulk of senior management.

For ValueAct, betting on the megatrend of digital transformation started when Morfit had a board seat at Microsoft (MSFT.O) years ago.

While conventional wisdom might have suggested that companies like Insight could wither in the shadow of giants like Microsoft, this has not been the case as even Microsoft has sought partners with this specialized expertise, he said. There is a ""huge opportunity for the vendors to have partners that can make their services come alive.""

Oct 19 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) laid off under 1,000 employees across several divisions this week, Axios reported on Tuesday, citing a source, making it the latest U.S. technology company to cut jobs or slow hiring amid a global economic slowdown.

The layoffs affected less than 1% of Microsoft's total workforce of around 221,000 as of June 30.

""Like all companies, we evaluate our business priorities regularly and make structural adjustments accordingly. We will continue to invest in our business and hire in key growth areas in the year ahead,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said.

The company had said in July that a small number of roles had been eliminated and that it would increase its headcount down the line.

Several technology companies, including Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), and Snap Inc (SNAP.N), have cut jobs and scaled back hiring in recent months as global economic growth slows due to higher interest rates, rising inflation and an energy crisis in Europe.

382,452,Microsoft,2022-10-19,IBM expects to exceed annual revenue target on resilient cloud momentum,"













Oct 19 (Reuters) - IBM Corp (IBM.N) beat quarterly earnings estimates on Wednesday and said it expects to exceed full-year revenue growth targets as robust demand for the company's digital services helps cushion the blow from a strong dollar.

The IT software and services provider has been focusing on the so-called ""hybrid cloud"" after spinning off its legacy IT-managed infrastructure business, and posted double-digit growth across all its segments and geographies on a constant-currency basis in the third quarter.

IBM's shares rose 4.4% in extended trading.

The company's stock is proving to be a good place to hide in the current market turmoil, mainly due to IBM's revenue diversification, Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com, said.

IBM, whose cloud revenue rose 11% to $5.2 billion in the quarter, now expects the company's annual sales to increase more than its previous estimate of mid-single-digit growth at constant currency.

Enterprise spending is robust in the Americas, but IBM is seeing some softness in key areas such as new bookings and backlog churn in Western Europe due to the macroeconomic environment there, Finance Chief James Kavanaugh told Reuters.

This year's more than 17% surge in the dollar that also have large international operations.

IBM, which gets more than half its revenue from outside the United States, increased its full-year estimate for foreign exchange impact to 7% from 6%.

The company booked a forex hit of $1.1 billion in the third quarter.

Revenue came in at $14.12 billion, compared with $13.51 billion expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv data.

On an adjusted basis, IBM earned $1.81 per share, beating estimates of $1.77.

IBM's earnings are a sign that for enterprise-focused tech companies recessionary impacts will potentially be more of a lagging indicator, Futurum Research analyst Daniel Newman said.

Dow down 0.33%, S&P 500 down 0.67%, Nasdaq down 0.85%















NEW YORK, Oct 19 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks snapped a two-day streak of gains on Wednesday as weakness in shares of Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) and a rise in Treasury yields sapped momentum from the current earnings season and outweighed a surge in Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) shares.

The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note touched its highest level in more than 14 years as soft housing data did little to alter expectations the Federal Reserve will remain aggressive in hiking interest rates as it attempts to wrestle down stubbornly high inflation.

The rise in yields weighed on rate-sensitive names like real estate (.SPLRCR) stocks, down 2.56% as the worst-performing S&P sector on the day, and megacap growth names such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Energy (.SPNY) was the sole S&P sector to end the session in positive territory with a gain of 2.94%.

Abbott Laboratories tumbled 6.5% after reporting lower-than-expected growth in international medical device sales, hit by a strong dollar and supply challenges in China.

Netflix shares, however, jumped 13.1% as the best perfomer operformerP 500 after it attracted 2.4 million new subscribers worldwide in the third quarter, more than double the consensus forecast, and guided for 4.5 million additions by year-end.

""The bonds are just weighing so heavily on it ... it’s a shame to see good earnings be wasted,"" said JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America in Chicago.

""Ultimately earnings drives stocks but when they are being overshadowed it is tough to have that optimism, but ultimately good earnings will lead to stocks going higher, it is a matter of how much the macroeconomic picture is going to continue to hurt those earnings.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 99.99 points, or 0.33%, to 30,423.81, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 24.82 points, or 0.67%, to 3,695.16 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 91.89 points, or 0.85%, to 10,680.51.

Fed officials have largely been in sync in their public comments about the need to be aggressive in raising rates to tackle inflation. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari said job market demand remains strong and underlying inflation pressures probably have not peaked yet.

The Fed's ""Beige Book"" survey of economic activity showed firms noted price pressures remained elevated, although there was some easing in several districts, while the labor market showed some signs of cooling.

The U.S. central bank is widely expected to raise rates by 75 basis points for the fourth straight time at its November meeting.

The Fed's effect on the housing market continues to grow. Housing starts, a measure of new residential construction, dropped 8.1% in September in the latest sign of the economy losing steam.

Housing starts building permits

The PHLX Housing Index (.HGX) stumbled -4.50%, marking another sector unlikely to help stocks reverse months of declines, with the three main U.S. indexes still mired in bear markets.

Dow components Procter & Gamble Co gained 0.93% and Travelers Companies Inc (TRV.N) rose 4.44% after the companies posted better-than expected quarterly profit.

Third-quarter profit growth expectations for S&P 500 companies have edged up to 3% from 2.8% on Tuesday, according to Refinitiv data, still well below the 11.1% increase forecast at the start of July.

Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) advanced 0.84% ahead of its earnings after the bell, with focus on any weakness in demand that is starting to weigh on the auto industry. Shares dropped 3.94% following the close as the electric vehicle maker missed revenue estimates for the third quarter.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.05 billion shares, compared with the 11.62 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.28-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.69-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 2 new 52-week highs and 9 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 42 new highs and 232 new lows.

384,593,Microsoft,2022-10-20,Brazil electoral court cracks down on disinformation ahead of Lula-Bolsonaro runoff,"













BRASILIA, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Brazil's national electoral authority is announcing moves to crack down harder on online disinformation in a fierce presidential campaign between far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro and leftist challenger Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.

The Superior Electoral Court (TSE) said the measures are intended to curb the ""distribution and sharing of knowingly untrue or gravely decontextualized information affecting the electoral process,"" according to the resolution.

The tougher stance, defined by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who currently runs the TSE, reflects a more aggressive approach to a tidal wave of dirty campaigning that has engulfed Brazil ahead of the Oct. 30 runoff.

The TSE will levy fines of 100,000 reais ($19,000) per hour for online platforms that fail to take down fraudulent content after two hours, according to the resolution, which will also ban all paid political advertising online in the 48 hours before the vote.

The TSE has already ordered some disinformation videos to be taken down, including ones that say Lula consorts with Satan and Bolsonaro embraces cannibalism. The campaigns have also been ordered by the court to pull online ads saying the leftist will legalize abortion and the incumbent entertains pedophilia.

The TSE crackdown has raised concerns from both campaigns that it is edging into censorship of legitimate political debate.

The Bolsonaro camp has complained that the TSE has told it not to run ads calling Lula ""corrupt"" and a ""thief"" because bribery convictions that put him in jail were later annulled by the Supreme Court.

Brazilian broadcasters have also said they have been prohibited from using the words ""ex-convict,"" ""thief"" or ""corrupt"" when speaking about Lula. The broadcaster lobby ABERT protested that such decisions were interfering with freedom of expression.

By contrast, Bolsonaro allies complain that the TSE has not stopped opponents from accusing the president of ""genocide"" for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic that killed 680,000 Brazilians.

And over the weekend, Lula allies were up in arms when the court blocked an ad using clips of Bolsonaro talking about visiting the home of adolescent Venezuelan migrant girls who he suggested were preparing to prostitute themselves.

On Wednesday, Moraes stressed the need for faster takedown of disinformation in a meeting with tech companies including Twitter Inc (TWTR.N); Google, owned by Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O); Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) LinkedIn; and Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, run by Meta Platforms .

Moraes said the platforms had helped keep disinformation within reasonable bounds ahead of the election's first-round vote on Oct. 2.

""But we are having a second round that is getting worse and worse in this aspect, and this has required tougher measures by the TSE,"" he told reporters on Thursday.

Summary Companies Some Fed officials show desire to slow down hikes -WSJ

Twitter, Meta fall after Snap's ad warning

AmEx, Verizon Communications fall after earnings

Dow up 2.47%, S&P 500 up 2.37%, Nasdaq up 2.31%















NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks surged to close out the trading week on Friday after a report said the U.S. Federal Reserve will likely debate on a smaller interest rate hike in December, raising hopes the central bank may be poised to adopt a less aggressive policy stance.

Some Fed officials have begun sounding out their desire to slow down the pace of increases soon, according to a Wall Street Journal report, and how to signal plans to approve a smaller increase in December.

San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly echoed that sentiment and said it's time to start talking about slowing the pace of the hikes in borrowing costs and doing so should avoid sending the economy into an ""unforced downturn"" by hiking interest rates too sharply.

In addition, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans reiterated his stance the Fed should get policy to ""a bit above"" 4.5% by early next year and then hold it there.

Analysts widely expect the Fed to hike rates by 75 basis points for a fourth straight meeting in November. Equities have been under pressure this year as the central bank has embarked on an aggressive rate hike path as it attempts to reign in stubbornly high inflation, increasing worries of a policy error that will send the economy into a recession.

""You had the (report) and then you had some confirmation that 75 seems to be pretty baked in for November here but perhaps there is room to slow and extend... rather than front-load so high and then have to peel off, you kind of ease to your 4.75% or 5% peak,"" said Tom Hainlin, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

""Then maybe just hold there for a while so you are getting a little bit of relief.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 748.97 points, or 2.47%, to 31,082.56, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 86.97 points, or 2.37%, to 3,752.75 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 244.87 points, or 2.31%, to 10,859.72.

For the week, the S&P 500 climbed 4.74%, the Dow gained 4.89% and the Nasdaq rose 5.22%. Each of the three major indexes notched their biggest weekly percentage gains in four months.

The report helped stocks recover from early losses as Snap Inc (SNAP.N) plunged 28.08% after posting its slowest quarterly revenue growth in five years as advertisers cut spending due to inflation and geopolitical woes.

That weighed on other companies that rely heavily on ad revenue such as Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), down 1.16% and Pinterest (PINS.N), off 6.40%.

Also falling after reporting quarterly earnings were American Express (AXP.N), which lost 1.67% and Verizon Communications , down 4.46%.

American Express said it built bigger provisions to prepare for potential defaults as an economic downturn looms while Verizon's profit slid 23% and the carrier missed estimates for wireless subscriber additions.

Next week will bring earnings from names such as Twitter (TWTR.N), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

Despite the recent batch of disappointing results, third-quarter earnings season has so far has been better-than-feared, with growth expectations for S&P 500 companies at 3.1%, according to Refinitiv data, up from 2.8% earlier in the week but still well below the 11.1% forecast at the start of July.

Schlumberger (SLB.N) shot up 10.33% to help to lift the S&P 500 energy sector (.SPNY) 2.76% after reporting a quarterly profit above expectations.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.15 billion shares, compared with the 11.57 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.59-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.03-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 9 new 52-week highs and 32 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 60 new highs and 322 new lows.

386,762,Microsoft,2022-10-21,"Take Five: Westminster woes, Tokyo on yen watch","













LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The breathtaking pace of political events in Britain is keeping traders on their toes, while Japan is back on intervention watch.

The European Central Bank is expected to deliver another bumper interest rate hike, and earnings season is ramping up with corporates in the United States and Europe facing very different cross currents.

Here's a look at the week ahead in markets from Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, Lewis Krauskopf in New York, and Dhara Ranasinghe, Joice Alves and Karin Strohecker in London. Graphics by Vincent Flasseur and Sumanta Sen.

1/ WHO RULES BRITANNIA?

Brought down after just six weeks as British prime minister by a radical economic programme that rocked markets, pushed up living costs for voters and enraged much of her own party, Liz Truss has quit.

Rishi Sunak looked set to become Britain's next prime minister after Boris Johnson withdrew from the contest on Sunday.

The Conservative Party, which holds a big majority in parliament and is not obliged to call an election for another two years, plans to select a new leader by Oct. 28.

Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt is due to deliver a new budget on Oct. 31. He faces the uphill task of finding tens of billions of pounds in spending cuts - in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis - to rescue Britain's battered fiscal reputation, with currency and fixed income markets in the doldrums.

UK gilt yield moves since mini budget

2/ DETERMINED DOVE, HESITANT HAWK

The Bank of Japan meets on Oct. 28 and is expected to continue running against the grain of global central banks by sticking to its extraordinary levels of stimulus - even as its policy exacerbates a politically unpopular plunge in the yen to a 32-year low beyond 150 per dollar.

Japan intervened in the foreign exchange market on Friday to buy yen for the second time in a month, and likely did so again on Monday. The BOJ conducted emergency bond buying last week to keep a lid on yields, showing its commitment to easing.

In Australia, the monetary policy outlook is much murkier. The Reserve Bank's decision in October to slow the pace of rate hikes reverberated in global markets, leading some to say the peak of policy tightening worldwide might be reached soon.

Recent data has backed the case for a slower pace of hikes with Australian employment numbers posting a disappointingly small rise in September. That put the spotlight on quarterly inflation data due on Wednesday that could help determine the next policy move.

3/ SUPER SIZE ME

The ECB is widely expected to deliver its second supersized 75 basis-point rate hike on Thursday. Joining the global rate-hike party late, the ECB has delivered 125 bps worth of rises in two meetings in its fastest pace of policy tightening on record.

With euro area inflation at almost 10% versus an ECB target of 2%, there's little appetite to slow down now, even if recession risks are rising.

In fact, expect ECB chief Christine Lagarde to face plenty of questions about when the central bank will start scaling back its bondholdings in the next tightening phase. Policymakers are also believed to be closing in on a deal to change the rules governing loans to banks that have benefited from a sudden jump in rates.

4/ HERE COME THE BIGGIES

More than 300 S&P 500 companies are due to report results over the next two weeks as the U.S. third-quarter earnings season heats up. Reports from companies such as Goldman Sachs, Lockheed Martin, Bank of America and Netflix have heartened investors in those firms' shares.

Still, overall S&P 500 earnings growth is only expected to have climbed 3% year-on-year, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S. That would be the worst performance in two years and is down from an expectation of 4.5% at the start of October.

Faltering profit growth would remove a key pillar that has helped shelter U.S. stock markets from more severe declines. Among companies due to report in the coming week are the four largest in the U.S. by market value: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.

5/ EUROPE INC. REALITY CHECK

It's a different story in Europe, where soaring costs of energy, raw materials, labour and credit and tangled supply chains are chipping away at earnings expectations.

Nonetheless, a different lockdown sequencing and favourable currency effects mean companies listed on the pan-European STOXX 600 regional index are expected to report a rise of about 28.4% in earnings in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S. Nonetheless, that's down from an expected 32% jump pre-reporting season and a whopping 60% growth in Q3 2021.

So far results have been mixed: Telecom equipment makers Nokia and Ericsson missed analysts' expectations, but on a brighter note Birkin bag maker Hermes saw a sharp rise in sales growth, and the world's second-biggest spirits group Pernod Ricard beat expectations.

387,168,Microsoft,2022-10-21,Wall Street Week Ahead: Megacap earnings to test fledgling U.S. stock rebound,"













NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Earnings reports from the four biggest U.S. companies by market capitalization in the coming week may test a nascent rally that has seen stocks claw their way back from yet another low.

Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) account for a combined 20% of the weight of the S&P 500 (.SPX) and more than a third of the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC).

Investors view the growth giants as bellwethers for how corporate America is faring during a year in which inflation has soared, pushing the Federal Reserve to quickly enact a series of jumbo-sized rate hikes that bruised markets and raised fears a recession may be coming.

“If these megacaps can’t do well, then the question is: who can do well?” said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at BMO Wealth Management.

Top stocks' market value as percentage of S&P 500

The S&P 500 is up nearly 5% from its Oct 12 closing low for the year after posting its biggest weekly gain since late June. Even with stocks' latest rebound, the index has dropped 21% so far in 2022, on track for its biggest decline since 2008.

Resilient corporate profits have been one bright spot this year, though doubts are growing over how sustainable they will be. With the bulk of S&P 500 companies still to report, third-quarter profits are estimated to have climbed 3.1% versus the year-ago period, which would be the weakest performance in two years, according to Refinitiv IBES, while earnings growth expectations for 2023 have fallen to 7.2% from 7.8% on Oct 1.

Next week's reports from the four megacaps may show whether companies with dominant positions can post solid performance despite worries of a potential economic downturn.

Because of their heavy weightings, ""if those stocks don’t get it done, that puts pressure on the indices to continue to go down,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services.

Microsoft and Alphabet are due to report on Tuesday, with Amazon and Apple set for Thursday.

Apple shares are the only ones of the megacaps that have outperformed the broader market this year. Shares of the iPhone maker, which account for a 7% weight in S&P 500, are down about 17% in 2022; Microsoft and Amazon are each off roughly 28%, Alphabet is down 30%.

Despite those steep losses, investors have maintained exposure to the megacap stocks. Actively managed U.S. mutual and exchange-traded funds held 11.41% of their portfolios in those four stocks combined as of the most recently available data, versus 11.44% at the end of 2021, according to Morningstar Direct.

Investors have been drawn to the large companies broadly because of their financial strength and competitive advantages that, in theory, will drive profits even during uncertain economic times.

Still, only Apple has topped analyst estimates for earnings and revenue in both of their most recent quarterly reports, according to Refinitiv data.

""The bar is higher for Apple because it has outperformed and because you haven’t seen the earnings blink yet,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital.

Questions loom over the other companies' key market areas, including personal computers for Microsoft, advertising spending for Alphabet and consumer strength for Amazon.

All three rely on cloud computing businesses, which will be in focus next week, according to Charlie Ryan, partner and portfolio manager at Evercore Wealth Management.

“Cloud would be the pillar that one would put their hopes on when they report,” Ryan said. “It has been continued strength for quite some time now and any deviation from that would be a concern.”

Meanwhile, soaring U.S. bond yields are pressuring valuations and complicating the picture for tech and other growth stocks, whose expected future earnings are discounted steeply by higher yields. Yields continued to rise this week, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note hitting a fresh 14-year high.

All four stocks command higher valuations than the S&P 500, which trades at nearly 16 times forward earnings estimates. The P/Es for Apple and Microsoft are both about 22 times, Alphabet trades at 17.5 times, while Amazon sits at 60 times, according to Refinitiv Datastream.

“Those stocks have typically sold at earnings multiples that are on the higher side,” said Carlson, of Horizon Investment Services.“How they are going to continue to perform from here gives some insight into what investors are ultimately willing to pay for growth stocks.”

388,776,Microsoft,2022-10-24,Diwali delight for Indians as Rishi Sunak set to become UK PM,"Summary

Summary Companies Sunak set to become PM later on Monday or Tuesday

Sunak, father-in-law's Indian firm trend on Twitter in India

India PM Modi calls Sunak a bridge between the two countries















NEW DELHI, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Many Indians are delighted at the prospect of Rishi Sunak becoming the first person of Indian origin to become British prime minister, just as Hindus like him celebrated Diwali across the world on Monday.

Sunak was set to take the top job after his rivals Boris Johnson and Penny Mordaunt withdrew from the race to replace Liz Truss as leader of the Conservative Party. Truss quit after a month and a half as her support evaporated and Sunak was poised to formally take over as prime minister later on Monday or Tuesday.

Sunak's expected rise to the premiership had already made it to the front pages of most Indian newspapers - alongside the Indian cricket team's win over arch-rivals Pakistan in a T20 World Cup match late on Sunday. Sunak, as well as Indian software company Infosys (INFY.NS), founded by his father-in-law, trended on Twitter in India after he was chosen as the leader of his party.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called him a bridge between the two countries.

""As you become UK PM, I look forward to working closely together on global issues, and implementing Roadmap 2030,"" Modi said, referring to a plan to boost trade and other ties between the countries.

""Special Diwali wishes to the 'living bridge' of UK Indians, as we transform our historic ties into a modern partnership.""

Former British Chancellor of the Exchequer, or finance minister, Sunak, 42, is known to celebrate the festival of lights. He has also been photographed lighting candles outside No. 11 Downing Street - the finance minister's official residence - to mark the occasion.

Some Indians said Sunak becoming prime minister this year would be even more special as India recently celebrated 75 years of its independence from British colonial rule.

""Rishi Sunak took oath as an MP on (Hindu holy book) Bhagavad Gita. If he repeats the same for taking oath as prime minister, what a day it is for India, that too on our 75th year of independence from Britain,"" Chennai resident D. Muthukrishnan wrote on Twitter.

'WATERSHED MOMENT'

Indians typically take immense pride when those who trace their roots to the nation of 1.4 billion people do well abroad, including figures such as U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai.

But some Indians wondered if Sunak's fate could be repeated in India, where there was strong opposition to Italian-born Sonia Gandhi's proposed elevation to the post of prime minister after taking her Congress party to electoral victory in 2004.

""I think all of us will have to acknowledge that the Brits have done something very rare in the world, to place a member of a visible minority in the most powerful office,"" Congress lawmaker and former U.N. diplomat, Shashi Tharoor, said on Twitter.

loading

""As we Indians celebrate the ascent of @RishiSunak, let's honestly ask: can it happen here?""

Sunak's family migrated in the 1960s to Britain, which ruled India for about 200 years before the South Asian country gained independence in 1947 after a long struggle led by Mahatma Gandhi.

Some British Indian supporters of the Conservatives were also celebrating his rise, with party member Ravi Kumar, 38, from Nottingham, calling it a ""watershed moment"".

""I grew up in the 80s and 90s, and I could not even imagine a non-white prime minister in my lifetime,"" he said. ""I always just saw it as a white country and we'd come in as children of immigrants ... So to see a British Indian leader is phenomenal.""

Sunder Katwala, director of think-tank British Future, also said it was a historic moment, showing the changes in British politics and public life in recent decades.

""It's a new normal at the top of British politics and partly because of the chaos of politics at the moment,"" he said.

""We have the third female prime minister, followed by the first Asian Prime Minister ... Rishi Sunak is actually the fifth British Asian cabinet minister in history, and there wasn't one until 2010.""

Revelations that Sunak's wife Akshata Murthy, an Indian citizen, had not been paying British tax on her foreign income through her ""non-domiciled"" status - available to foreign nationals who do not see Britain as their permanent home - hurt Sunak ahead of his race against Truss in the summer.

Murthy, who owns a 0.9% stake in Infosys, later said she would start to pay British tax on her global income.

His family wealth has proved a divisive issue for some.

""Rishi Sunak as Prime Minister isn't a win for Asian representation,"" tweeted opposition Labour lawmaker Nadia Whittome, who also has Indian roots.

""He's a multi-millionaire who, as chancellor, cut taxes on bank profits while overseeing the biggest drop in living standards since 1956. Black, white or Asian: if you work for a living, he is not on your side.""

A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.

A frenetic weekend of political and policy action has injected significant two-way volatility into world markets, which are also now on high alert for signs the U.S. Federal Reserve may ease its foot off the interest rate brake.

Talk of a change of tack emerged late Friday amid reports the Fed was minded to reduce the size of its rate hikes after another 75 basis point rise next week, then pausing the tightening campaign some time next year.

The reports triggered a recoil in U.S. bond yields from their highest levels in over a decade, while futures pricing for a peak Fed 'terminal rate' of more than 5% next year fell back by more than 10bp to less than 4.90% on Monday.

But that was just the start of the gyrations across currencies, bonds and stocks everywhere.

A surge in Japan's ailing yen from 32-year lows later on Friday, amid reports of out-of-hours Bank of Japan intervention in New York, saw a peak-to-trough drop in dollar/yen of almost 4%. There were wild swings again on Monday amid suspicion of further BoJ sales, even though officials refused to confirm the action.

With the dollar back up above 149 on Monday, the scene is set for prolonged battle as the BoJ policy meeting this week is unlikely to veer from the ultra-loose monetary stance that's been undermining the currency as the Fed and others raise rates.

A weekend of political twists from Beijing to London only added to edgy market on Monday.

China leadership China's Xi Jinping secured a precedent-breaking third leadership term on Sunday and introduced a top governing body stacked with loyalists.

But the shape of the leadership team saw Hong Kong stocks slide 6% to 13-year lows and China's onshore yuan stumbled to its weakest level in 15 years, with Xi's picks heightening fears that economic growth will be sacrificed for ideology-driven policies.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index (.HSI) has now underperformed MSCI's broadest global stock index by almost 50% over two years.

Delayed Chinese economic releases did little to calm to markets, with better-than-forecast third-quarter growth and September industry numbers offset by disappointing retail and housing readouts. Oil prices also slipped down as the sweep of China data disappointed.

London then added to the volatile political picture on Sunday as weeks of turmoil within the UK government were given an added twist when former Prime Minister Boris Johnson pulled out of the race to succeed ousted Liz Truss.

Sterling and British bonds firmed amid relief the country may now avoid another divisive leadership battle and yet another potential U-turn on fiscal policy. Former finance minister Rishi Sunak is widely expected to be the new PM, with reports that standing finance minister Jeremy Hunt is set to quash even more tax relief plans to steady the country's finances.

But much like China's latest economic health check, European business survey readings for this month were another dark cloud for the world economy in general just as the European Central Bank is set to raise interest rates again this week.

Although European stocks were marginally higher on Monday, U.S. equity futures were in the red again - with mega-cap U.S. tech firms due to report third-quarter earnings over the next couple of days. Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Apple are all due.

Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Monday:

* Flash Oct business surveys from the United States, Europe and from around the world; Chicago Fed Sept National Activity Index

* U.S. corp earnings: Discover Financial Services, WR Berkley, Cadence Design Systems, Brown & Brown, Packaging Corp of America, Alexandria Real Estate Equities

* Bank of England Deputy governor for Markets and Banking Dave Ramsden speaks in London

* Bank of Spain governor Pablo Hernández de Cos speaks in Madrid

Oct 25 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever

Bad (economic) news is good news, and good (earnings) news is also good news.

That's the general outlook on Wall Street right now as investors continue to claw back some of this year's losses - U.S. stocks on Monday shrugged off steep declines in Asia, especially China, to extend the bear market rally of the last two weeks.

The S&P 500 has rebounded some 9% from its Oct. 13 low, laughing in the face of rising bond yields and interest rate expectations. Monday's gains came despite recession-territory U.S. PMIs and a spike in the VIX volatility index back above 30.

Investors have plenty of other reasons to be cautious too: liquidity and financial stability concerns; political, economic and market trends in China; Japan's policy conundrum and FX market interventions; British political and market turbulence.

The news flow from Asia, in particular, is not conducive to a 'risk-on' trading environment. MSCI Asia ex-Japan and China's benchmark indexes fell to post-2020 lows on Monday, and the offshore yuan slumped to its lowest level since it was introduced in 2010.

You wouldn't bet against Asian and U.S. stock markets continuing to diverge.

One relative bright spot, however, could be U.S. earnings. So far, almost one-fifth of S&P 500 companies have reported. Of those, 75% have beat expectations, according to Refinitiv data.

The Q3 reporting season goes into overdrive this week with results from tech giants and tech-heavy firms including Twitter, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Meta Platforms and Amazon.com all on the docket.

If the Wall Street rebound is to continue and ripple to Asia, these results in particular could be crucial.

391,112,Microsoft,2022-10-24,Microsoft powers up search for Chinese gaming hits in race against Sony,"













HONG KONG, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is stocking up on Chinese video game content to emulate Sony Group Corp's (6758.T) success with ""Genshin Impact"", sources said, solidifying China's transition from a land only of players to a hub of blockbuster developers.

The U.S. software giant and Japan's vanguard of technology have for some years been offering big money to small developers to nurture programmes and licence titles, but the impact of ""Genshin Impact"" has added a sense of urgency, sources said.

The action role-playing game from budding Shanghai studio miHoYo has generated billions of dollars since its release two years ago, and raised the bar in multi-player, cross-platform games - the type sources said Microsoft and Sony seek in China for their Game Pass and PlayStation Plus subscription services.

Growing Western interest in Chinese games reflects a maturing of China's game development industry, analysts said. Chinese games are now on a par with big-budget Western games, said Daniel Ahmad, senior analyst at researcher Niko Partners.

""Chinese game developers are trying to standardise their development tools, create advanced production processes, invest in really large-scale teams,"" Ahmad said. ""Ultimately, that helps provide them with the competitive edge to reach a broad audience both in terms of geography and platforms.""

Microsoft has been building a team to scout for Chinese games, two industry sources said. The Xbox maker mainly filled its subscription roster with big-brand titles but is now wooing even independent studios with big-money offers, they said.

At the same time, filings showed Microsoft is expanding its subscription service to personal computers and handheld devices, increasing the appeal of Chinese developers such as miHoYo which have developed a reputation for multi-player, cross-platform compatibility - with ""Genshin Impact"" being a prime example.

One executive, whose studio signed a licensing deal with Microsoft three years ago to feature its game on Game Pass, said the U.S. firm recently offered a licensing deal many times bigger for a sequel.

""We are not signing it yet because we think that when we fully complete our game, it will get an even better offer,"" the executive said.

Illustrating the money involved, filings showed Microsoft paid $2.5 million to feature action game ""ARK: Survival Evolved"" on Game Pass and $2.3 million for sequel ARK 2 - both from U.S. developer Studio Wildcard, owned by China's Snail Games.

An executive at another developer, Recreate Games in Shanghai, said his company signed a deal with Microsoft last year for its upcoming multi-player title ""Party Animals"" to launch exclusively on Xbox.

""Xbox contacted many projects in China and these projects primarily focus on developing console and PC games,"" said Chief Executive Luo Zixiong.

Microsoft did not respond to emailed requests for comment.

PLAYING CATCH-UP

Microsoft was slower off the mark in China compared with Sony. The Japanese firm launched gaming accelerator programme ""China Hero Project"" in 2017 aimed at helping Chinese developers publish games on its PlayStation. It has supported 17 titles of which seven have reached the market.

""We've been quiet for the past two years. But the programme is still very much humming along,"" Kuangyi Zhou, former manager of the China Hero Project, told Reuters in April. ""We are proud of all the games which have successfully emerged from the programme... There is no doubt that a new batch will be coming.""

In 2019, Sony partnered miHoYo, a little-known studio which was developing ""Genshin Impact"". The game - a global hit when it was released a year later - is available for personal computers and handheld devices, but the console version is exclusively on PlayStation.

Microsoft regretted missing out on ""Genshin Impact"", two people familiar with the matter said. It spoke to miHoYo early in the game's development but did not reach a deal, one of them said. The other person said the experience is the driving force behind Microsoft's more active pursuit of Chinese developers.

""Picking up 'Genshin Impact' made Sony a lot of money,"" the second person said, declining to be identified because the information was not public.

There is no public data on console revenue from ""Genshin Impact"", but data from Sensor Tower put the figure at $3 billion for mobile devices as of May.

MARKET EVOLUTION

For much of the 21st century, Chinese gamers mostly played imported titles as home-grown games were viewed as being poorer in production value. Even Chinese gaming leader Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) started out publishing foreign games at home.

As the market grew into the world's largest, local studios increasingly invested in developing better-quality games. The trend accelerated with regulatory restrictions on new games and limits on the number of imports, and benefited from the return of engineers who had worked at top-tier studios such as Ubisoft Entertainment SA (UBIP.PA) and Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O).

Gaming executives now point to ""Genshin Impact"" as a global industry milestone, lauding its production value and seamless cross-platform game play. Apple Inc (AAPL.O) even used the game to demonstrate the power of its premium devices including the new iPad Air equipped with its latest M1 processor chip.

Another milestone was 2021's ""Naraka: Bladepoint"" from NetEase Inc (9999.HK), China's second-largest games firm. While most Chinese titles are free to play and profit from in-game sales, ""Naraka: Bladepoint"" sold over 10 million copies despite its $20 price, reflecting confidence in its production value.

The game caught the attention of both Microsoft and Sony, two sources told Reuters. One of them said NetEase prioritised Microsoft which made the game a Game Pass exclusive in June.

392,93,Microsoft,2022-10-24,"Microsoft revenue forecast under threat from PC market slump, mighty dollar","













Oct 24 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is set to post its slowest quarterly revenue growth in over five years on Tuesday, with some analysts casting doubts whether the company can maintain its annual outlook in the face of a PC market slowdown and a strong dollar.

A spike in inflation this year has fanned worries of a global economic slowdown and forced consumers and businesses to pull spending on computers and laptops, sapping sales of some of Microsoft's key products including Windows and the Office suite.

Adding to the squeeze, the dollar has climbed more than 17%, weighing on the earnings of companies with big global operations. Microsoft earns more than 50% of its revenue outside the United States.

""All eyes will be on Microsoft's ability to maintain FY23 guidance for reported double-digit revenue growth, which we believe is at risk,"" Guggenheim analysts said last week.

UBS has said the stock seems to have largely priced in a potential walk back on the forecast.

At least 15 brokerages have lowered their price targets on the software giant in October, and the company's shares have declined by more than a quarter in 2022.

CONTEXT

PC shipments declined 19.5% in the third quarter this year, according to data from research firm Gartner.

Windows licenses form about 12% to 13% of Microsoft's revenue and the PC market downturn is expected to dent its sales by 100 basis points, Morningstar senior analyst Dan Romanoff said.

The blow is expected to be slightly offset by Microsoft's cloud services unit Azure, which is set to grow 20% in the first quarter, according to Refinitiv data.

""Our CIO survey work suggests that enterprise IT usage of Azure is likely to gain share vs. Amazon AWS,"" J.P. Morgan said in a recent note.

But signs of a slowdown in cloud adoption have started emerging. An analysis by Piper Sandler showed total revenues at the top 100 software firms are estimated to grow 22% in 2022 and 20% in 2023, down from 33% in 2021.

Software firms are the biggest customers of cloud platforms and their business growth is taken as proxy for the cloud services sector.

Tesla slides on worries of softening China demand

U.S. business activity contracts in October

Indexes up: Dow 1.34%, S&P 1.19%, Nasdaq 0.86%















NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Monday, extending last week's gains as signs of economic softness suggested the effects of the Fed's aggressive policy aimed at cooling the economy, thereby curbing decades-high inflation, are beginning to take root.

All three major U.S. stock indexes gained momentum throughout the first session of a week jam-packed with high profile corporate earnings and crucial economic data.

A report from S&P Global showed a contraction in business activity this month, offering a hint that the Federal Reserve's barrage of steep interest rate hikes are having their desired effect, raising hopes that the central bank could begin slowing the pace of increases to the Fed funds target rate.

""It’s a sign the economy is slowing down and what the Fed is doing is working,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""They may be achieving their goal and we might be approaching the fourth quarter of rate hikes, to use an football analogy.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 417.06 points, or 1.34%, to 31,499.62, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 44.59 points, or 1.19%, to 3,797.34 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 92.90 points, or 0.86%, to 10,952.61.

Among the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, nine closed green, with healthcare (.SPXHC) enjoying the largest percentage gain. Materials (.SPLRCM) and real estate (.SPLRCR) ended the session in negative territory.

Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) shares slid 1.5% after the electric automaker cut prices for its Model 3 and Model Y cars by as much as 9% in China, signaling softening demand in the world's largest auto market.

U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies such as Pinduoduo (PDD.O), JD.com and Baidu Inc plunged between 12% and 25% as President Xi Jinping introduced the new Politburo Standing Committee stacked with loyalists.

""The news coming out of China makes you think there’s going to be a firmer if not antagonistic China in our future,"" Tuz added. ""But it’s too early to see how it’s going to play out as far as where you invest in the future.""

Third quarter earnings season shifts into overdrive this week. So far, nearly one-fifth of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported. Of those, 74.7% have delivered consensus-beating results, according to Refinitiv data.

Analysts expect S&P 500 earnings growth of 3.0%, on aggregate, down from 4.5% at the beginning of the month, per Refinitiv.

Results from a slew of heavy-hitting tech and tech-adjacent companies are likely to dominate the earnings chatter this week.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) following on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) step up to the plate, with Amazon.com (AMZN.O) wrapping up the FAANGs on Thursday.

High-rolling industrials are also expected to post earnings this week, including United Parcel Service (UPS.N), Boeing Co (BA.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N), 3M Co (MMM.N), General Motors Co (GM.N), Chevron (CVX.N) and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N).

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.36-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 21 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 73 new highs and 331 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.80 billion shares, compared with the 11.56 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Consumer confidence sours, home price growth cools

S&P 500 closes 8% above Oct. 12 closing trough

Indexes up: Dow 1.07%, S&P 1.63%, Nasdaq 2.25%















NEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed sharply higher on Tuesday as soft economic data hinted that the Fed's aggressive policy is taking effect, while falling benchmark Treasury yields boosted the rally's momentum.

All three major U.S. stock indexes advanced for the third straight session, with market-leading megacaps providing the most upside muscle. The S&P 500 has reclaimed about 8% from the trough of its Oct. 12 close.

""There’s increasing discussion about a light at the end of the tunnel for Fed rate hikes,"" said Bill Merz, head of capital market research at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. Merz also cautioned that it wouldn't be known for some time whether decades-high inflation was ""decisively headed toward the Fed’s target.""

""We’re seeing a bit of a reprieve in the dollar and long-term bond yields have come down a little bit,"" Merz added. ""Those factors are combining to provide room for a bit of a rally.""

After the bell, Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) delivered weaker than expected quarterly results, sending their shares down about 7%. That helped push S&P 500 emini futures down almost 1%, suggesting traders expect the stock market to open deep in negative territory on Wednesday.

Yields of 10-year Treasuries pulled pack on hopes that the Federal Reserve could begin easing its battle against inflation.

A mixed brew of earnings and downbeat forecasts, usually a negative for markets, have suggested the barrage of interest rate hikes from the Fed is beginning to be felt, raising expectations that the central bank could pull back on the size of rate hikes after its Nov. 1-2 policy meeting.

Data on Tuesday showed slowing home price growth and souring consumer confidence. Such signs of economic softness, ordinarily unsupportive of risk appetite, are evidence of abating Fed hawkishness.

The financial market is nearly evenly split on whether the central bank's December rate increase will ease to 50 basis points after a string of 75 basis point hikes, according to CME's FedWatch tool.

Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, all but energy (.SPNY) posted gains on the day, with real estate (.SPLRCR) enjoying the largest percentage gain.

Third-quarter reporting season is firing on all pistons, with 129 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 74% have beaten consensus expectations, according to Refinitiv.

Analysts have set the bar low; aggregate S&P 500 earnings growth is now seen landing at 3.3% year-on-year, down from 4.5% at the beginning of the month, per Refinitiv.

Coca-Cola Co rose 2.4% after the company upped its revenue and profit forecasts, banking on steady demand amid price increases.

General Motors (GM.N) reaffirmed its outlook after posting solid earnings, sending its shares jumping 3.6%.

On the downside, aerospace company Raytheon Technologies Corp posted a near 5% annual revenue increase, but its shares slid 1.5% on the company's trimmed sales outlook.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 5.35-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.67-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

395,429,Microsoft,2022-10-25,Morning Bid: This is the yuan,"













Oct 26 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever

If investors are warming to Wall Street, however fleeting that rapprochement may turn out to be, they could not be giving Chinese markets a colder shoulder.

Wariness over exposure to China has been building for a while, as reflected by the steady decline in the onshore and offshore exchange rates, tech stocks and the equity complex more broadly, to cite some examples.

The two trading sessions since President Xi Jinping tightened his grip on the country by securing a historic third term as leader last weekend suggest that wariness has deepened.

China's main equity indexes on Tuesday failed to claw back Monday's heavy losses, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index hit a new 13-year low. And that was despite recording its worst day since the global financial crisis the day before.

Hong Kong tech stocks might have bounced 3%, but they've still lost 45% in just four months.

Then there's the yuan. It is depreciating fast as capital outflows accelerate - the onshore yuan is at its weakest since 2009 and the offshore yuan is the lowest ever since its 2010 launch.

Is the central bank losing its ability to control the exchange rate? Some observers say the People's Bank of China is no longer directing the market, rather it is following it.

All that said, perhaps the bouyant sentiment across U.S. markets will filter through to China and Asia on Wednesday. It was 'Turnaround Tuesday' for Treasuries - especially the long end - while Wall Street posted another solid rally.

Q3 earnings are doing much of the heavy lifting - nearly three quarters of the 129 S&P 500 companies who have reported so far have posted profit beats, according to Refinitiv data. Microsoft and Alphabet are the big hitters up after Tuesday's bell.

The move contrasted with the 5% surge in UBS shares (UBSG.S) after the Swiss bank logged a smaller-than-expected 24% slide in quarterly net profit amid robust client inflows, lower costs and financial trading that helped offset a hit to investment banking from this year's market volatility. read more

397,229,Microsoft,2022-10-25,S&P 500 adds to mid-October rebound from bear market low,"













Oct 25 (Reuters) - The S&P 500's (.SPX) over 1% surge on Tuesday adds to two weeks of strong gains as investors speculate that third-quarter earnings reports could help pull the market out of its downturn.

Apple (AAPL.O), Tesla (TSLA.O) and other tech-related stocks drove Wall Street higher, with Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) each adding about 1% ahead of their quarterly reports after the bell as investors bet that a relatively strong start to third-quarter earnings season will continue.

With its latest rise, the S&P 500 (.SPX) is up about 8% from its closing low on Oct. 12, and a close at its current level would mark the index's third largest gain from a low so far in 2022's bear market. Tuesday's gains put the S&P 500 about 10% above its intra-day low on Oct. 13.

Over 280 days have passed between the S&P 500's record high and its most recent low. That compares to 33 days that the S&P 500 took in 2020 to fall from its record high close to its lowpoint as global markets reeled because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

S&P 500 bear markets

This year's selloff has dragged the S&P 500's forward earnings valuation down from a historically high 21 to about 15, just below its 10-year average of 17, according to Refinitiv data.

Earnings expectations have also sunk this year, with analysts on average expecting S&P 500 companies to increase their adjusted earnings per share by 6.8% in 2022. That compares to an estimate of 9.5% in July.

S&P 500's forward PE dips below 10-year average

Still, third-quarter earnings season so far has been better than expected, with nearly three quarters of the 129 companies in the S&P 500 exceeding earnings per share estimates, according to Refinitiv data.

Following this year's rout, several sectors this month are showing signs of recovery.

Every S&P 500 stock's performance in October

With Amazon (AMZN.O), Microsoft, Tesla, Nvidia (NVDA.O) and other tech-related heavyweights still badly bruised in 2022, the S&P 500 growth index's (.IGX) performance is far below the value index (.IVX), which reflects smaller losses in sectors ranging from industrials to consumer staples.

398,47,Microsoft,2022-10-25,"Cloud to PCs, Microsoft forecasts spook investors as economy bites","













Oct 25 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Tuesday projected second-quarter revenue below Wall Street targets across its business units, stoking fear that macroeconomic headwinds are impacting the cloud business in addition to the PC unit.

Revenue growth in the first quarter was Microsoft's lowest in five years, and shares of the software giant fell 7% in extended trading.

Microsoft's cloud business, called Azure, has supercharged revenue growth at the software giant for years. But in its first fiscal quarter of 2023, that growth dropped to 35% and the company projects that to drop again in the current quarter, which is its second quarter. Microsoft missed the 36.5% analyst target compiled by Visible Alpha due to a stronger dollar.

""If this growth deceleration continues, it could harm an investment case in the company’s stock which is considered a safe-haven amid the market turmoil,"" said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com.

The company said it expects the Intelligent Cloud business to pull in revenue of $21.25 billion to $21.55 billion in the second quarter, slightly below analysts' estimates of $22.01 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

""We expect Azure revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly five points on a constant currency basis,"" Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood told analysts on a conference call. That would be a growth of 37% on a constant currency basis, and much lower taking into account foreign exchange rates.

""In a weird way, everyone expected there to be a disaster when the pandemic hit. And it was the exact opposite. But at some point that impact was going to hit and it's hitting now,"" said Bob O’Donnell, an analyst for TECHnalysis Research, adding that even businesses like the cloud can't escape the impact. Still he said Microsoft has diversified its business and is in a good position to ride out the hard times.

The maker of Windows has seen demand slide for its ubiquitous computer software as the spike in inflation forces businesses and consumers to pull back on spending.

Current-quarter revenue from the personal computing unit was projected between $14.5 billion and $14.9 billion, below estimates of $16.96 billion.

""The PC market was worse than we expected in Q1,"" Brett Iversen, head of Microsoft's investor relations, told Reuters. ""We continued to see that deteriorate throughout the quarter, which impacted our Windows OEM business.""

Windows OEM business, which includes the operating software Microsoft sells to PC makers, dropped 15% year-on-year. Iversen said that part of the business did not have much of an impact from foreign-exchange headwinds and the drop was mainly PC-market driven.

Still, demand held up for its diverse portfolio of products including Outlook and Teams that have made Microsoft essential to businesses adopting flexible work models.

Revenue growth in the first quarter was $50.12 billion, up 11% year-on-year. The figure was slightly above analysts' expectations of $49.61 billion.

Net income fell to $17.56 billion, or $2.35 per share, during the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $20.51 billion, or $2.71 per share, a year earlier.

399,609,Microsoft,2022-10-25,Europe's STOXX 600 hits over one-month high as earnings offset economic gloom,"Summary

Summary Companies SAP earnings boost tech shares

UBS gains on profit beat

ECB set to raise rates this week















Oct 25 (Reuters) - Europe's STOXX 600 index closed higher for the second straight day on Tuesday after a slew of better-than-expected earnings reports helped offset worries about fast-rising interest rates and a slowing euro zone economy.

The pan-European stock index (.STOXX) rose 1.4%, to close at its highest level since Sept 20, with real-estate (.SX86P), technology (.SX8P) and financial (.SXFP) sectors leading the gains.

Boosting financial stocks, UBS (UBSG.S) climbed 7.7% after the Swiss bank beat market expectations for quarterly profit due to a rise in new money inflows.

SAP (SAPG.DE) gained 6.5% after the German business software maker reported faster-than-expected revenue growth for the third quarter, while Logitech International (LOGN.S) jumped 12.5% after the computer peripherals maker reaffirmed its full-year forecast.

Overall, the quarterly updates helped lift sentiment despite lingering worries about a European recession as consumers and businesses buckle under pressure from surging inflation and higher borrowing costs to tame it.

Earnings from tech giants Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Google-owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) will set the tone on Wall Street this week.

""Our focus is on the forward outlook for Q4 and 2023 EPS, which has now started to fall, even though we believe it still to be at optimistic levels and thus subject to further cuts as companies report,"" said Leonardo Pellandini, equity strategist at Julius Baer.

""We reiterate our defensive positioning for the time being given the imminent slowdown in macroeconomic momentum.""

Third quarter earnings are expected to increase 31.3% year-over-year. Of the 65 companies in the STOXX 600 that have reported earnings to date, 55.4% have beat analysts' profit estimates, as per Refinitiv IBES data. In a typical quarter, 53% top estimates.

While European corporate earnings are expected to grow 31.3% in the third quarter, it is seen up 18.6% in the fourth quarter and just 3% in the first quarter of 2023.

The European Central Bank (ECB) is widely expected to deliver a second straight 75 basis point rate hike this week, but a recent report suggesting the U.S. Federal Reserve might slow its pace of rate hikes has raised hopes of a pivot from the ECB too.

That prompted Euro zone bond yields to fall, boosting the rate-sensitive technology stocks.

Among other stocks, Air Liquide (AIRP.PA) rose 6.7% after the French industrial gases company beat quarterly sales expectations despite a slowdown in European demand.

Adidas (ADSGn.DE) dropped 3.2% after the German sportswear maker terminated its partnership with the American rapper and designer Kanye West immediately over antisemitism and hate speech. Separately, Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to ""underweight"".

Summary

Summary Companies Investment cut comparable to 2008-09 financial crisis

Q3 profit plunges 60%, misses estimates

Inflation, gloomy economic outlook weigh on demand















SEOUL, Oct 26 (Reuters) - South Korea's SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS) warned on Wednesday of an ""unprecedented deterioration"" in memory chip demand, deepening fears of global recession, and said it would slash investment after quarterly profit tumbled 60%.

The world's second-largest memory chipmaker, whose clients include Apple Inc (AAPL.O), said its investment in 2023 will be cut by more than 50% - an echo of cuts the memory chip industry endured in the 2008-09 financial crisis that provides a stark portrait of the depth of a worldwide slowdown in tech demand.

Chipmakers had enjoyed a strong post-pandemic demand surge until early this year. But demand has turned sharply weaker in recent months as soaring inflation, rising interest rates and gloomy economic outlook have led consumers and businesses to tighten spending.

""We are hoping that the market will stabilise to some extent by second half of next year, but we are not ruling out the possibility of a longer downturn,"" Kevin Noh, Chief Marketing Officer at SK Hynix, told analysts.

Investors looked beyond the bleak outlook to welcome the aggressive investment cut, sending SK Hynix shares 1.7% higher in a bet the scale of the action would help control chip oversupply and prop up chip prices.

SK Hynix's dire projections add to a flurry of warnings from U.S. tech giants this week of faltering growth prospects. Microsoft Corp on Tuesday projected quarterly revenue below Wall Street targets across its business units, including its cloud business and PC unit.

SK Hynix said its operating profit fell to 1.66 trillion won ($1.16 billion) in the July-September quarter, from 4.2 trillion won a year earlier. The result was below analysts' expectations of a 1.87 trillion won profit, according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate.

""Supply will continue to exceed demand for the time being,"" SK Hynix said in a statement, pointing to a fall in notebook and smartphone shipments.

Memory chip prices plunged by 20% as demand fell across all applications in the third quarter, SK Hynix said, citing dropping PC and smartphone shipments while data centres prioritised using up existing chip inventory.

NO TURNAROUND TILL LATE 2023?

SK Hynix said its 2022 investment is expected to be at the ""upper range of 10-20 trillion won ($7-14 billion)"", meaning 2023 investments could fall below 10 trillion won.

""The capex cut was bigger than I expected,"" said Wi Minbok, analyst at Daishin Securities.

""Even if SK Hynix reduces investments, it will take around six months until actual output is affected ... We don't anticipate market conditions to turn around before the third quarter of 2023.""

Other chipmakers have also begun curtailing supply and investment. U.S. firm Micron Technology (MU.O) plans to cut investments by more than 30% next year, while Taiwanese giant TSMC has also cut its 2022 investment plan.

The spending cuts come as the global smartphone market, a key revenue source for the chip industry, contracted 9% on-year in July-September, marking the worst third-quarter since 2014, according to analysis provider Canalys.

SK Hynix also warned of uncertainties involving its chip plants in China due to U.S. export restrictions on advanced chip equipment to China aimed at slowing Beijing's technological advances.

The company received a one-year waiver on the restrictions for its chip plants in China, but said it would be difficult to operate its Wuxi plant in the country if the waiver was not extended, and may have to consider selling the plant or bringing equipment to South Korea.

Summary Companies Company reports Q3 beat, ups guidance

Shares fall on licence revenue worries

Company shifting towards subscription revenue

Big tech shares drop globally on Wednesday















GDANSK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - French software maker Dassault Systemes' (DAST.PA) shares dropped more than 5% on Wednesday, erasing Tuesday's gains, as investors reacted to reduced licence growth expectations in its third-quarter results.

The company, which sells software for carmakers, planemakers and industrial companies, raised its full-year earnings and revenue forecast, due in part to the stronger dollar, after reporting higher-than-expected quarterly results.

However, it lowered its 2022 objective for licences and other software revenue growth on a non-IFRS constant currency basis to 5-7% from 9-11% previously.

Jefferies deemed the publication an ""underlying disappointment, with licences falling short of expectations"".

The company's third-quarter software revenue grew by 8%, at the lower end of its guidance, but licences and other software revenue declined 2% year-on-year, the brokerage noted.

""We see this as a reminder of the cyclical risks at Dassault, which makes the extent of the current valuation premium hard to justify,"" Jefferies said.

The company reported total revenue of 1.37 billion euros ($1.36 billion) in the quarter, up 8% on the year in constant currencies and above analysts' forecast of 1.33 billion euros, driven by strong subscription and support growth.

""The bottom line of all of this, when you look at the total revenue mix, is that we accelerated the growth in subscription revenue, and this transition is well underway,"" CFO Rouven Bergmann said in a call.

""We are progressively increasing the share of recurring revenue while we continue to deliver the top-line revenue and profitability objectives despite the lower growth contribution from the licences,"" he added.

Dassault Systems increased its non-IFRS diluted earnings per share target for 2022 to 1.12-1.14 euro from 1.08-1.10 euro previously.

It also raised full-year revenue target to 5.61-5.65 billion euros.

The company's shares were down 5.1% at 1205 GMT, having gained 4.2% a day earlier.

The move also reflected big tech stocks' fall globally after grim results from Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) stoked fears of a global economic downturn.

Oct 26 (Reuters) - Gloomy results from Alphabet and Microsoft stoked fears of a global economic downturn and derailed an earnings-led surge in stock markets on Wednesday, while setting the tone for results from other megacap technology giants.

The Nasdaq (.IXIC) tumbled nearly 2% as the results underscored the fallout of strong dollar and weak demand on the tech sector against the backdrop of high inflation and rising borrowing costs.

Shares of the Google-parent (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) fell about 8% in early trading. Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), which will report after markets close, was down 4%, while Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) lost 4% and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) 1% in the run-up to their results on Thursday.

Heavyweights Netflix (NFLX.O), Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Apple have already lost a combined market value of more than $2.5 trillion so far this year and were set to shed another $330 billion on Wednesday.

""The results of the big technology firms were seen as a key determining factor in market sentiment going into the U.S. third quarter reporting season and both Microsoft and Alphabet have given investors reason to worry,"" said Laith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at AJ Bell.

Alphabet missed Wall Street's target for revenue growth in the third quarter as ad sales remained weak, while inflation and a strong dollar led Microsoft to report its slowest topline growth in five years. read more

Reuters Graphics

At least 21 analysts cut their price target on Alphabet, lowering it by as much as $36, while 17 of them brought down their targets on Microsoft.

With analysts predicting a pullback in budgets for advertising due to rising prices, investors fear that Meta's business too could come under pressure as it revenue relies heavily on ads.

""Investors will be bracing for Meta's results with some trepidation, with a common thought being that if Google's struggling, the rest of the tech pack faces a marathon climb,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

For Meta, Google Search's soft results are worrisome while YouTube and Snap weakness suggest that macro and ad targeting challenges continued in the third quarter, JMP Securities analyst Andrew Boone wrote.

Meanwhile, a slowdown in growth at Azure, Microsoft's cloud platform and one of its most successful businesses, raised worries around Amazon's cloud business.

While most Big Tech stocks have edged higher in the past few weeks, overall it has been a bleak year for the sector that has lost roughly 15% to 60% of their value.

Wednesday's selloff also hit Europe's tech index (.SX8P), falling 2.3% to lead sectoral losses in the region. read more

Summary

Summary Companies Google shocks market with weaker-than-estimated ad revenue

SK Hynix warns chip sector facing 'unprecdented deterioration'

Weak earnings come amid soaring inflation, interest rate hikes















Oct 26 (Reuters) - U.S. companies from tech giants Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft to GE (GE.N) and toymaker Mattel (MAT.O) reported big slowdowns in growth or warned things were going to get worse, fanning recession fears and driving down stocks.

The gloomy reports spilled into Asia on Wednesday, with South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS) saying the memory chip market is facing ""unprecedented deterioration"" and it plans to cut investment next year by more than 50%. Its third-quarter profit plunged 60%.

South Korean flat-screen maker LG Display Co Ltd (034220.KS) posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss.

The rash of disappointing results points to a host of problems in the global economy, including soaring inflation and interest rate hikes that have battered consumer demand.

U.S. consumer confidence ebbed in October, data showed Tuesday, after two straight monthly increases, amid heightened inflation concerns and worries of a possible recession next year.

After years of turbo-charged growth, Microsoft posted its slowest rise in sales in five years and Google parent Alphabet grew just 6% last quarter, its slowest pace since September 2013 barring a small quarterly decline in 2020.

Google, which many had expected to be more resilient because of its status as the world's largest digital advertising platform by market share, shocked the market with weaker-than-estimated advertising revenue as customers in the insurance, mortgages and cryptocurrencies industries tightened their ad budgets.

""Despite being seen as one of the most insulated companies in the advertising space relative to peers, Google's poor quarter is the latest sign that worsening fundamentals and a tough macroeconomic environment are prompting advertisers to cut back on spending,"" said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.

Google's results bode ill for Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META.O), which is especially reliant on advertising and reports results on Wednesday. Last week, its smaller rival Snap Inc (SNAP.N) forecast no revenue growth for the holiday quarter, setting off warning bells in the social media industry.

Alphabet said it plans to cut hiring by more than half.

Conglomerate GE, which is in the process of breaking up into three companies, said it will reduce global headcount by a fifth at its onshore wind unit, which has been battling higher raw material costs due to inflation and supply-chain pressures.

Shares in Alphabet slumped 7% in trading after the bell. Microsoft fell 2% and chipmaker Texas Instruments , which forecast quarterly revenue and profit below estimates, was down 5%. Shares in Spotify (SPOT.N), which also warned on slow advertising growth, slid 4%. Meta shares fell 4%.

BRIGHT SPOTS

A lack of demand for personal computers and laptops was evident in Microsoft's past quarter as its Windows business slumped 15%, a sharp turnaround after months of pandemic-fueled sales driven by people working and studying from home.

Texas Instruments (TI) echoed the sentiment, backing up similar predictions from fellow chipmakers Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) earlier this month.

""During the quarter we experienced expected weakness in personal electronics and expanding weakness across industrial,"" said TI boss Rich Templeton. The company, like other chipmakers, has to contend with gadget makers cutting orders to clear stockpiles of chips after the pandemic-led boost in demand quickly flipped to a slump in a matter of weeks.

Weak demand for consumer electronics has also been flagged by Apple (AAPL.O) iPhone assembler Foxconn (2317.TW) as China's economy has slowed dramatically on COVID 19-related curbs.

Mattel, which is very susceptible to discretionary spending cuts, lowered its profit forecast for the year and said it would ramp up promotions heading into the busy holiday season to encourage inflation-hit shoppers to buy its Barbie dolls.

Earlier on Tuesday, post-it maker 3M Co said it expected weak consumer spending to continue into the upcoming holiday season and cut its full-year forecasts.

Still, there were bright spots in other report cards.

Tesla Inc supplier LG Energy Solution Ltd (LGES) (373220.KS) swung to a profit in the third quarter on strong electric vehicle (EV) battery demand and favourable foreign exchange rates.

Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N) reported quarterly sales and profits that topped the Street as wealthier customers chowed down on their burritos despite higher prices even as lower-income consumers ate there less often.

Coca-Cola Co , a favorite in a slowdown, joined rival PepsiCo Inc in lifting its annual forecasts, as customers bought their sugary sodas despite multiple rounds of price hikes.

404,405,Microsoft,2022-10-26,Morning Bid: Policy peak?,"













Oct 27 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever

First Australia, now Canada. Who'll be next to blink on interest rates?

The Bank of Canada on Wednesday raised rates by 50 basis points, less than the 75 bps markets had expected. This surprise mirrored the Reserve Bank of Australia's half point hike three weeks ago, when investors had again positioned for an additional 25 bps of tightening.

""We are getting closer to the end of this tightening phase,"" BOC chief Tiff Macklem said, citing recession fears.

That's two of the world's major central banks now signaling that the peak in rates is in sight, while Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said last week that the market's rate path was too aggressive.

The European Central Bank and Bank of Japan are up next with policy decisions in the next 48 hours. Although they are at very different stages of the cycle - the BOJ hasn't even started tightening yet - dovish surprises could add fuel to the 'risk on' rally currently underway.

chart

Ok, Wall Street struggled on Wednesday in part due to earnings misses from Microsoft and Alphabet, but the S&P 500 hit a six-week high intraday and is up 7% this month. The VIX volatility index hit a six-week low, while bond yields fell sharply for a second day.

The dollar is also falling, another development that should in theory ease financial conditions and support risk assets. It is down 2% this week, on track for its biggest weekly fall since the COVID-19 pandemic's darkest days in March 2020.

Only time will tell how much of all this is simply a snap back in extreme positioning. But if the remaining heavyweight U.S. earnings this week beat forecasts and the ECB and BOJ play ball, it could have further to run.

Three key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Thursday:

ECB rate decision (expected 75 bps hike)

U.S. advance GDP (Q3)

Summary

Summary Companies Nasdaq, S&P 500 dragged by disappointing earnings

Sterling continues rally, hits highest since mid-September

Britain delays tax and spending plan announcement to mid-Nov















WASHINGTON/LONDON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - U.S. shares were mixed and world equities eased off a five-week peak on Wednesday, as the dollar's decline boosted commodities and pressured Treasury yields.

Investors weighed disappointing earnings from U.S. heavyweights against hopes the Federal Reserve will slow its aggressive pace of interest rate hikes.

The pound touched its highest level since Sept. 13, continuing its rally after Rishi Sunak became Britain's prime minister. News that the British government's plan to repair the country's public finances will be delayed by more than two weeks to Nov. 17 pushed up bond yields.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) closed a hair higher, rising 0.01%. The S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 0.74% and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 2.04%, dragged by disappointing earnings and warnings from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O).

MSCI's World Stock Index (.MIWO00000PUS) was lower after touching a five-week high. Europe's Stoxx 600 (.STOXX) finished up 0.7% at its strongest level since Sept. 20.

Some of Europe's largest banks warned of growing risks as the economy fizzles after they posted stronger-than-expected profits, helped by a trading boom in volatile markets and higher interest rates. Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) posted a better-than-expected jump in third-quarter profit, and Britain's Barclays (BARC.L) also beat profit forecasts.

Google owner Alphabet posted softer-than-expected ad sales after Tuesday's close and Microsoft missed revenue forecasts, while a warning from Dutch semiconductor supplier ASM (ASMI.AS) added to concerns about slowing economic growth.

U.S. new home sales decreased 10.9% and mortgage rates reached their highest level in 20 years last week, data showed.

Asian shares rallied, in a sign that some investors were taking comfort from a perception that a turn in the global rate-hike cycle may be near.

Although the Fed is widely expected to deliver another 75 basis-point hike in November, a sense that it could then start to slow its aggressive tightening cycle has lifted sentiment in share markets and taken the edge off a dollar rally.

""I wouldn't want to take the optimism too far. We think it's still too soon for the Fed to make a significant pivot and the stronger markets are, the more likely it is that the Fed wants to be more cautious about wanting to make a pivot,"" said Andrew Sheets, chief cross-asset strategist at Morgan Stanley.

Sheets also noted ""more downside risk"" for earnings.

The Bank of Canada, meanwhile, announced a smaller-than-expected rate rise of 50 percentage points. That put its policy rate at 3.75%, a 14-year high but coming up short on calls for another 75 basis-point move to contain stubbornly high inflation.

""With Bank of Canada raising lesser than expected, you're definitely seeing a good switching away from earnings,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) rallied more than 1%, while Japan's Nikkei (.N225) hit its highest level since Sept. 20.

The euro pushed back above $1 for the first time in five weeks .

In Australia, inflation raced to a 32-year high last quarter as the cost of home building and gas surged. The surprise added pressure on the central bank to reverse a recent dovish turn, though markets doubt there will be a dramatic shift.

China's yuan rebounded sharply to close the domestic session at the strongest level in two weeks, as traders and corporate clients raced to liquidate long dollar positions .

Market participants became cautious after major state-owned banks were spotted selling the dollar on Tuesday to stabilize the market, traders said.

Investors increased bets on the Bank of England raising its benchmark rate by a full percentage point on Nov. 3 after news of the delay of a tax and spending plan announcement, putting the chances of such a move at around 37%.

U.S. Treasury yields fell, helped by a weaker dollar and Fed hopes.

The weaker greenback also boosted commodities, making them less expensive to holders of other currencies. Spot prices touched a two-week high and were last up 0.65%. U.S. gold futures settled up 0.7% at $1,669.20.

Elsewhere in commodities, Brent crude futures settled up 2.3% at $95.69 a barrel, as U.S. crude finished 3% higher at $87.91.

NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended a three-day winning streak on Wednesday, closing in negative territory as gloomy earnings guidance added to growing fears of a global economic slowdown.

But those fears, along with a smaller-than-expected interest rate hike from the Bank of Canada, continued to feed hopes that the Fed might consider easing the size of its rate hikes after its Nov. 1-2 policy meeting.

""Today the market is catching up with the move upward over the last week or so,"" said Matthew Keator, managing partner in the Keator Group, a wealth management firm in Lenox, Massachusetts. ""There are still two Fed meetings ahead of us this year.""

Paul Kim, Chief Executive Officer at Simplify ETFs in New York, agrees.

""Central banks are starting to blink,"" Kim said. ""It’s part of the larger trend and supports the pivot narrative.""

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq ended in negative territory, dragged lower by market-leading tech and tech-adjacent companies following results from Microsoft and Alphabet. The blue-chip Dow eked out a nominal gain.

Microsoft and Alphabet shares tanked, falling 7.7% and 9.1%, respectively.

Those downbeat reports brought worries over an impending global economic downturn from simmer to boil, and spread to other high profile megacaps.

Sales of newly constructed U.S. homes plunged in September while mortgage rates hit their highest level in more than two decades, adding to the growing pile of data suggesting a softening economic landscape.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.37 points, or 0.01%, to 31,839.11, the S&P 500 lost 28.51 points, or 0.74%, to 3,830.6 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 228.12 points, or 2.04%, to 10,970.99.

Five of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 ended the session in the red, with communications services and tech were suffering the largest percentage losses.

Third quarter earnings season has shifted into high gear, with 170 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 75% have delivered consensus-beating results, according to Refinitiv.

But they have a low bar to clear. Analysts see aggregate S&P 500 earnings growth of 2.3%, down from 4.5% at the beginning of the month, per Refinitiv.

""There have been pockets of promising corporate earnings announcements this quarter,"" Keator added. ""I don’t think it's necessarily a fait accompli that we’re going to continue to see earnings misses across the board.""

Boeing Co reported a deeper than expected third quarter loss, sending its shares sliding 8.8%.

On the plus side, Visa Inc rose 4.6% in the wake of the consumer credit company's profit beat.

Facebook parent Meta Inc shares fell more than 12% in after-hours trading after posting results.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.71-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.41-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 25 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 113 new highs and 77 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.26 billion shares, compared with the 11.60 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Oct 26 (Reuters) - European shares reversed early losses to hit a five-week high on Wednesday after a smaller-than-expected interest rate hike by the Bank of Canada (BoC) ignited hopes that major central banks could temper rate-hike stance.

408,744,Microsoft,2022-10-26,Kanye West's lawyers cut ties amid hate speech storm,"













(Reuters) - As corporations including Adidas AG end multi-million-dollar deals with the artist formerly known as Kanye West following anti-Semitic comments, his lawyers are following suit.

Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan partner Alex Spiro told me that despite recent reports that the rapper now called Ye was his client, he is not representing him.

Ye “asked me to be his attorney but the representation never formalized,” Spiro, whose other clients include Elon Musk, said via email. “I do not represent Mr. West.”

A Ye representative did not respond to a request for comment for this column.

Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft said it had ended its work for Ye. “We are not presently providing any representation and have no intention of providing any future representation,” a firm spokesman said.

Cadwalader partner Nicholas Gravante penned a letter on Ye’s behalf to The Gap Inc last month, notifying the retailer that his then-client was terminating the partnership because the company allegedly failed to live up to contractual obligations.

Brown Rudnick also “no longer represents Kanye West,” a spokesman confirmed. The firm is home to high-profile litigator Camille Vasquez, who represented actor Johnny Depp in his defamation suit against his ex-wife Amber Heard.

And Ye’s most recent divorce lawyer (he’s had several), Robert Cohen of Cohen Clair Lans Greifer Thorpe & Rottenstreich, also told me by email, “We are no longer representing Ye.” Cohen previously represented Melinda French Gates in her divorce from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.

The moves come after Ye on Oct. 3 wore a “White Lives Matter” t-shirt at Paris Fashion Week — a phrase that the Anti-Defamation League says is a white supremacist slogan.

Five days later, he tweeted “I’m a bit sleepy tonight but when I wake up I’m going death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE.”

The professional repercussions have been swift and severe. My Reuters colleague Uday Sampath Kumar on Tuesday reported that the musician has been knocked off the Forbes list of the world's billionaires as a result of Adidas terminating its deal with him.

""Adidas does not tolerate antisemitism and any other sort of hate speech,"" the German company said on Tuesday.

European fashion house Balenciaga has also cut ties with Ye, Kumar reported, and Gap has removed Yeezy Gap products from its stores and shut down YeezyGap.com.

In addition, Reuters reported that Creative Artists Agency no longer represents Ye, and that film and television studio MRC Entertainment has scrapped a documentary about him.

If there’s one thing Ye could probably use about now, it’s a good lawyer. Still, it's clear why his A-list counsel no longer wish to be associated with him.

I’m not saying only saints deserve lawyers. But attorneys are not taxi cabs, obligated to take on anyone who can pay the fare. They make choices about who they want to represent. And I don’t fault those who would prefer not to devote themselves to protecting the bank account of someone who spews hate speech.

“The prevailing rule is that lawyers can drop a client for virtually any reason — including that they don't like being associated with the client — as long as the representation ends ‘without material adverse effect on the interests of the client,’” Bruce Green, a professor at Fordham University School of Law, said via email.

To be sure, lawyers can’t simply terminate a representation in the midst of litigation. The client and generally the court must give permission to exit, and that can take time.

For example, Greenberg Traurig partner Justin MacLean is currently defending Ye in a copyright suit brought by Ultra International Music Publishing in Manhattan federal court, according to PACER. MacLean did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

But for legal work that’s not before a tribunal, ethics expert Stephen Gillers, a professor at New York University School of Law, told me told me Ye’s lawyers are free to quit “so long as they do so in an orderly way.”

“It should not be a problem for him to get new counsel,” Gillers said. “In the presumably short interim until new counsel is on board, they have to protect his interests.”

Since Ye remains rich (albeit less rich) and famous, I'm sure he'll find lawyers willing to go to bat for him. But almost certainly, that list will be much shorter than it used to be.

409,745,Microsoft,2022-10-26,Morning Bid: Consumer drain as banks gain,"













A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.

This year's inflation and interest rate shock to consumers is mirrored by the massive windfall for the world's leading banks - the political optics of which rankle as central banks are set to push borrowing rates even higher.

Deep in the weeds of the third-quarter earnings season, Big Tech and other consumer favourites are clearly feeling the chill of the cost of living crisis as well as a higher dollar and supply chain disruptions - upping global recession fears as financial conditions tighten. read more

Quarterly results from mega caps Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) disappointed late Tuesday and sent both their shares down about 7% after the bell, cutting across an earlier surge in Wall St stock benchmarks (.SPX). S&P500 futures were down almost 1% on Wednesday, halving Tuesday's index gain.

Google's results in particular bode ill for Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META.O), especially reliant on advertising and reporting its results late on Wednesday. Apple and Amazon detail how their businesses fared on Thursday.

Consumer blues contrasted with bumper earnings from banks who are raking in huge windfalls from rising interest rates - direct cash injections from reserves they hold at central banks along with higher net interest margins and trading revenues flattered by volatile markets. read more read more read more read more

European banks reporting this week matched Wall St counterparts on that score, raising conundrums for the European Central Bank meeting this week and Bank of England and U.S. Federal Reserve gatherings next week. They all plan further policy rate rises to rein in inflation - but this also involves direct transfers to their banks and potentially a drain on government finances. read more

The Bank of Canada is expected to lift rates by another three-quarters of a percentage point to a fresh 14-year high later on Wednesday, and Canada's dollar climbed sharply in advance of the decision. read more

The darkening economic skies responsible for the dour real sector earnings were still clear in downbeat U.S. consumer confidence and housing readings on Tuesday, and mounting recession fears have raised speculation about whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon be forced to slow the blistering pace of credit tightening. read more read more

With energy price rises also easing back gradually, especially Russia-squeezed natural gas costs in Europe, hopes for some Fed respite fears dragged long-term bond yields and the U.S. dollar back lower again too.

Ten-year Treasury yields have lunged back close to 4% over the past 24 hours, more than 30 basis points below Friday's peak. The dollar recoiled across the world against the euro, yen, sterling and yuan - sliding back through parity versus the euro for the first since in over a month.

Chinese shares (.CSI300), (.HSI) finally stabilised on Wednesday after this week's withering slide on worries about the economic and political direction of reconfirmed President Xi Jinping's new cabinet. The offshore yuan rebounded from record lows against a weaker dollar.

Sterling also caught the slipstream of a falling greenback but UK government borrowing rates edged back up on reports Britain's new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak could delay the announcement of a plan to repair the country's public finances beyond the expected Oct 31. read more

Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday:

* U.S. Sept new home sales, trade balance, wholesale inventories. Eurozone Sept credit and money supply,

* Bank of Canada policy decision

* U.S. Treasury auctions 5-year notes, 2-year FRNs.

* Bank of England Director for Financial Stability, Strategy and Risk Lee Foulger speaks in London

410,470,Microsoft,2022-10-26,French software firm OVHcloud bets on price hikes to offset power bills,"













Oct 26 (Reuters) - French cloud services company OVHcloud (OVH.PA) on Wednesday forecast organic revenue growth between 14% and 16% next year, as its full-year sales grew despite rising electricity costs which the firm hopes to offset through price increases.

Soaring energy prices as a consequence of Russia's war in Ukraine have raised costs for cloud providers, which use electricity to power their energy-intensive servers. The rising bills have prompted many in the industry, including OVHcloud, to hike prices.

""Demand remains strong,"" Chief Executive Officer Michel Paulin told journalists in a call, pointing to the group's high client retention rate despite price hikes.

The company said in a statement it did not see any change in its customer behaviour.

OVHcloud shares were up around 7% by 0946 GMT, while J.P. Morgan in a note flagged the firm's net retention rate standing at 114% in the full-year 2022 ended in August, ""up significantly"" on last year.

Sales for the period stood at 788 million euros ($790.60 million), up 18.8% year-on-year, and beating the 781 million average forecast from a company provided consensus.

RISING ELECTRICITY BILLS

OVHcloud, which made its market debut in October 2021, warned however of rising power bills, forecasting that electricity costs in 2023 will account for around a mid-to-high-single digit percentage of its revenue, up from mid-single digit in 2022.

Early signs of weaker demand for its services had emerged this year, after a boost from remote work and the subsequent increase in use of cloud services during COVID-19 lockdowns.

In June, the company flagged flattening demand for some of its services, particularly from smaller customers like start-ups and cryptocurrency firms.

OVHcloud's larger software rival Microsoft Corp on Tuesday projected second-quarter revenue below Wall Street targets, reinforcing worries around rising inflation forcing businesses and consumers to pull back on spending.

Nonetheless, OVHcloud reiterated its 2025 target for sales growth accelerating to 25%, and profit margins near 42%.

411,755,Microsoft,2022-10-27,Apple earnings rise as economic gloom hits tech,"













Oct 27 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Thursday reported revenue and profit that topped Wall Street targets, one of the few bright spots in a tech sector battered by spending cutbacks due to inflation.

The forecast for the holiday quarter was more grim. While not providing specific numbers, Apple said revenue growth would fall below 8% in the December quarter but did not go as far as Amazon.com AMZN.O, whose dire holiday outlook sent its shares down 14%.

Apple shares initially dipped in after-hours trading but recovered in positive territory.

The Cupertino, California-based tech giant was saved by its oldest technology, its laptop computers, while its star, the iPhone, stumbled.

Although iPhone sales were not as strong as some analysts had targeted, they were still a record for the September quarter. Mac sales of $11.5 billion were far head of analyst estimates of $9.36 billion.

Apple's results showed some resilience in the face of a weak economy and strong U.S. dollar that has led to disastrous reports from many tech companies. Like Facebook parent Meta (META.O) and Snap (SNAP.N), Apple is seeing softness in advertising spending. Overall, Apple said quarterly revenue rose 8% to $90.1 billion, above estimates of $88.9 billion, and net profit was $1.29 per share, topping with the average analyst estimate of $1.27 per share, according to Refinitiv data.

""We did better than we anticipated, in spite of the fact that foreign exchange was a significant negative for us,"" said Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri.

The rising U.S. dollar has hit many companies such as Apple that generate substantial foreign revenue and are getting less cash back when they convert it. For consumers, it increases the price of new devices when bought in countries outside of the United States.

Apple's iPhone sales for the company's fiscal fourth quarter rose to $42.6 billion, when Wall Street expected sales of $43.21 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES.

Maestri said iPhone sales set a record for the September quarter, improving 10% over the prior year's quarter and exceeding the company's forecast.

""The iPhone number is a hint of the turmoil and uncertainty in the market, but Apple has different ways to offset,"" said Runar Bjorhovde, a research analyst at market research firm Canalys.

Sales of Apple's Mac computers received a boost from this summer's introduction of redesigned MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptops. New tablets went on sale this week.

Apple said its gross margin of 43.3% was a record for the September quarter.

[1/2] The logo of Apple company is seen outside an Apple store in Bordeaux, France, March 22, 2019. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau 1 2

Maestri said the robust computer sales also reflected a backlog of orders, caused by a prolonged shutdown at one of the factories that produces Macs, which the Apple was able to fill in the quarter.

The company reported sales of iPads were $7.2 billion, compared with the average estimate of $7.94 billion.

Apple wearables such as AirPods and other accessories notched sales of $9.7 billion, slightly ahead of the Wall Street forecast of $9.2 billion.

""They said they didn’t have particular issue with supply, so that seems to be a thing of the past,"" said Creative Strategies consumer analyst Carolina Milanesi.

Growth in the company's services business, which has buoyed sales and profits in recent years, saw a rise to $19.2 billion in revenue, below the estimate of $20.10 billion.

Maestri said Apple experienced softness in digital advertising and gaming, as have others in the sector.

""Like other major tech companies, even Apple is suffering from the negative impact of a worsening macro backdrop and ongoing supply chain woes, though it has done a better job of navigating through the challenging environment,"" Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.

In China, which has experienced a sharp economic slowdown, Apple reported fourth-quarter sales of $15.5 billion. That is a gain from the prior quarter, when Apple logged sales of $14.6 billion.

Apple said it now has 900 million paying subscribers to its services, up from the previous quarter's 860 million.

412,365,Microsoft,2022-10-27,"EU wants 40-man antitrust team to enforce new tech rules, official says","













BRUSSELS, Oct 27 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are looking to establish a 40-man team and hire a technology expert to enforce tough new rules aimed at reining in the powers of Big Tech, an EU official said on Thursday.

The rules known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA) sets out a list of do's and don'ts for Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Meta (META.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and other gatekeepers which control access to their sites and the data there.

Reuters exclusively reported in July that the European Commission was considering creating a new directorate to allay concerns that it may struggle to get deep-pocketed and well-advised tech companies to comply with the new rules.

A 12-man unit headed by antitrust veteran Thomas Kramler who is currently handling the Apple and Amazon antitrust investigations and a 9-person strong taskforce will move to the new directorate, the official said.

The EU competition enforcer aims to hire 19 more people for the directorate and a chief technology officer to focus on data, the official said.

The new unit will need the green light from the college of commissioners from the 27 EU countries in the coming weeks before it can be set up.

Enforcement of the DMA will be done jointly with the Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology which has also set up a new unit for the task.

The Commission has previously said some 80 enforcers would be needed.

413,443,Microsoft,2022-10-27,Capgemini 'comfortable' with top end 2022 targets but sees demand slowing,"Summary

Summary Companies Lower attrition, economic slowdown will lead to fewer hires

Concerns grow about shrinking IT budgets

Shares fall more than 2%















Oct 27 (Reuters) - French IT consulting group Capgemini (CAPP.PA) sees demand slowing in 2023 but expects results at the top end of guidance this year driven by its cloud, data and artificial intelligence businesses.

""The group expects demand to decelerate a bit in the coming quarters, but it remains confident that 2023 will be a year of growth, even if probably not as strong as in 2022,"" Chief Executive Aiman Ezzat said on a media call on Thursday.

His comments come amid growing fears that an economic slowdown could dent IT budgets after gloomy results from tech giants Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

The company has forecast revenue growth in 2022 of between 14% and 15% on a constant currency basis and an operating margin of 12.9% to 13.1%, which analysts said could be seen as conservative given healthy demand.

Capgemini shares were down more than 2% at 0727 GMT.

The company estimates growth in the fourth quarter at around 10%, chief financial officer Carole Ferrand said on the call.

The group reported third-quarter revenue of 5.55 billion euros ($15.8 billion), up 15.7% from the same period a year earlier at constant exchange rates. Bookings in the quarter rose 13% to 5.43 billion euros.

""Given this very good Q3 performance, we now feel comfortable with the top end of our growth outlook for

2022,” Ezzat said in the company's statement.

It expanded its workforce 16% year on year, reaching headcount of 358,400 at the end of September.

The group also said it will hire less as growth slows and attrition rate moderates in a stabilising talent market.

The high demand for IT specialists due to a shortage of available workers has forced many companies to increase wages to attract new talent in a competitive market.

414,519,Microsoft,2022-10-27,Wall St loses over $200 billion in value after report from Amazon,"













Oct 27 (Reuters) - Over $200 billion in U.S. stock market value went up in smoke in extended trade on Thursday, after a weak forecast from Amazon (AMZN.O) added to a string of downbeat quarterly reports from Big Tech companies.

Amazon's stock tumbled 17% after the bell, wiping out $190 billion in market capitalization after the retail and technology heavyweight projected a holiday slump that would leave current-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates.

Also after the bell, Apple (AAPL.O) shares fell about 1%, erasing about $30 billion of its stock market value after the Cupertino, California company reported quarterly iPhone sales that fell short of Wall Street targets.

The latest in a string of poor quarterly results from some of Wall Street's most widely owned companies underscores deep worries about the health of the global economy as central banks raise interest rates in a battle against inflation.

""Big Tech companies are not impervious to slowdowns in the economy, particularly if they are consumer driven,"" said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.

""As the Fed embarks on this planned slowdown, it is eating away at some of their consumer-faced businesses, and given their high multiples it is causing big contractions in their stock prices,"" Meckler said.

Amazon's weak report sent Nasdaq futures tumbling about 3%, showing traders expect Wall Street to open with a deep decline on Friday. Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) dropped about 1% each, adding to losses following their own poorly received quarterly reports on Tuesday.

Thursday's late-day reports also followed disappointing results from Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (META.O) that earlier sent its stock plummeting 25%. Thursday's drop left Meta's stock market value at about $260 billion, with the one-time behemoth now about the 20th most valuable company on Wall Street.

If Amazon's drop after hours is reflected in Friday's trading session, it will have been its deepest one-day loss since 2006.

Among a handful of winners late on Thursday, Pinterest (PINS.N) surged 12% after the social media platform reported higher than expected quarterly revenue, while Intel (INTC.O) climbed 6%, despite forecasting annual revenue below analysts' estimates.

415,533,Microsoft,2022-10-27,Tech rout widens as Meta sinks after results,"













Oct 27 (Reuters) - A carnage in U.S. technology stocks widened on Thursday as shares of Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) sank 20% after the Facebook parent's costly metaverse bets and the impact of soaring inflation on ad spending spooked investors.

Meta was set to lose about $78 billion in market value, if losses hold to the end of the session, adding to the trillions of dollars that some of the biggest tech names have shed this year amid rising interest rates and a stronger dollar.

Meta has lost more than half a trillion dollars in market value so far this year. Its shares were trading at $100.55, their lowest since February 2016.

The company's results come a day after Google and Microsoft posted dismal numbers, sparking a widespread selloff in technology stocks.

Analysts said investors are worried because Meta is spending on capital-intensive projects at a time when the ad market, a major source of revenue for the company, is drying up.

The company expects to spend about $10 billion a year for metaverse hardware and software, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg saying on Wednesday that he expects those investments to take about a decade to bear fruit. read more

""Meta Horizon Worlds (at present) is a relative ghost town when compared to other 3D immersive worlds like Roblox and Fortnite,"" said Mike Proulx, research director at Forrester.

CHIP BOON

Meta's aggressive spending on the metaverse, however, is likely to be a boon for one segment of the broader technology sector - chipmakers.

Its plans require capital expenditure for new data centers and infrastructure, said Ben Barringer, analyst at Quilter Cheviot.

Data center-focused companies such as Broadcom Inc (AVGO.O), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) could get a boost from Meta's plans. Their stocks rose between 1.4% and 4.3%.

But for Meta, things look bleak a year after it changed its name to focus on the metaverse, a shared virtual reality where people can interact with each other through avatars.

So far this year, Reality Labs, the company's metaverse unit, has already lost $9.44 billion in revenue, while last year the unit recorded more than $10 billion in losses.

Meta has predicted that the unit's losses would grow further in 2023 and pledged to ""pace"" investments after that.

At least 13 brokerages cut their price target on the stock, with J.P. Morgan slashing to a Wall Street low of $115.

416,613,Microsoft,2022-10-27,Investors punish Zuckerberg as costly metaverse pitch falls flat,"













Oct 26 (Reuters) - Wall Street is losing patience over Meta (META.O) boss Mark Zuckerberg's enormous and experimental bets on his metaverse project that helped drive up the company's overall costs by a fifth in the third quarter.

Investors rushed to dump Meta Platforms Inc's stock after hours, pushing it down 20% and wiping $67 billion off its market value after the company posted its fourth straight decline in quarterly profit.

The Facebook-parent said its overall expenses could rise as much as 16% next year and anticipates that operating losses at Reality Labs - the unit responsible for bringing the metaverse to life - ""will grow significantly"" next year.

One Meta shareholder had recently voiced concerns calling the company's investments ""super-sized and terrifying"". Analysts on Wednesday called them ""confusing and confounding"" and Meta's inability to cut costs ""extremely disturbing"".

On a post-earnings conference call, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill asked executives: ""I think kind of summing up how investors are feeling right now is that there are just too many experimental bets versus proven bets on the core ... I think everyone would love to hear why you think this pays off.""

In the July-September quarter, losses at Reality Labs ballooned to a whopping $3.67 billion from $2.63 billion a year earlier. Revenue nearly halved.

""It would be a mistake for us to not focus on any of these areas that will be fundamentally important to our future,"" Zuckerberg said on the call.

""I know that sometimes when we ship a product ... people say: 'Hey, you're spending all this money, and you've produced this thing,' and I think that's not really the right way to think about it.""

""...we're doing leading work that will become ... eventually mature products at different cadences in different periods of time over the next five to 10 years.""

He spoke about the company's various efforts, including a recently unveiled virtual and mixed reality headset called Quest Pro that is priced at $1,500 and a social metaverse platform where people can express themselves via avatars.

He said Meta is investing in two other areas: augmented reality and neural interfaces.

BIG GAMBLE

""The metaverse ... feels like a one big gamble given the economic crisis,"" said Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, adding that the journey ahead was going to be ""long and painful"".

""People are not rushing out of their seats to buy a VR headset or even watch 360 degree videos ... The new device still feels like an expensive toy,"" he said.

At a time when other tech companies such as Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) are cutting jobs or slowing hiring, Meta's headcount surged 32% in the third quarter from the end of the second.

In an open letter to Zuckerberg on Monday, Meta shareholder Altimeter Capital Management called on Meta to streamline by cutting jobs and capital expenditure.

The fund suggested Meta cap annual investments in the metaverse to $5 billion instead of the current $10 billion.

Dow up 0.61%, Nasdaq down 1.63%, S&P down 0.61%















NEW YORK, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq posted losses on Thursday, as investors contended with solid economic data and a mixed bag of corporate earnings.

The price-weighted Dow advanced, held aloft by industrials (.SPLRCI), while weakness in market-moving tech and tech-adjacent megacaps depressed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in the wake of downbeat quarterly results and dour guidance.

""It’s very much a bifurcated market, a tale of two cities,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist Ingalls & Snyder in New York.

""There's lot of pressure on tech and tech-plus names, higher growth names,"" Ghriskey added. ""On the flipside you’re seeing a lot of strength in other sectors, in particular consumer staples, energy, financials, industrials and utilities.""

After the bell, Amazon (AMZN.O) slumped 12%, erasing over $100 billion of its stock market value after the retail and tech heavyweight forecast a slowdown in sales growth for the holiday season, disappointing Wall Street and warning that inflation-wary consumers and businesses had less money to spend.

That sent S&P 500 futures down 0.5% and Nasdaq futures down 0.6%, showing traders expect Wall Street to open lower on Friday.

During Thursday's trading session, Meta Platforms (META.O) plunged 24.6% after the Facebook parent followed the trend set by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) by providing gloomy forward guidance.

But heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly profit, sending its shares jumping 7.7% and providing the most muscle to the Dow's advance.

A third-quarter GDP reading showing the U.S. economy returned to growth in the July-Sept period, along with steady quarterly core inflation helped take the sting out of earnings.

GDP

Investors continue to scan the economic horizon for evidence that the barrage of aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, begun in March, are beginning to have the desired effect by cooling down the economy.

While a 75 basis point rate hike at the conclusion of its Nov. 1-2 policy meeting is all but assured, the likelihood of a smaller, 50 basis point hike in December was 55%, according to CME's FedWatch tool.

""The overriding theme is really the Fed. The Fed is going to control the direction of this market over the coming months,"" Ghriskey added.

At Thursday's close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) was up 194.17 points, or 0.61%, to 32,033.28, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 23.3 points, or 0.61%, to 3,807.3 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 178.32 points, or 1.63%, to 10,792.68.

Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, industrials had the biggest percentage gain, with communication services (.SPLRCL), weighed by Meta, down the most.

Third-quarter reporting season forges ahead at full speed, with 227 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 74% have beaten consensus estimates.

Analysts now see aggregate S&P earnings growth of 2.5%, down from 4.5% at the beginning of October.

""In general we’ve seen earnings come in at or slightly above expectations,"" Ghriskey said. ""But those expectations have been lowered throughout the quarter.""

McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) gained 3.3% after the fast food chain beat quarterly same-store sales estimates.

Shares of Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) rose 2.7% after the carrier's quarterly profit topped consensus estimates.

Also after the bell, Intel (INTC.O) rallied 5% after the chipmaker cut its full-year profit and revenue forecast and said it was targeting $3 billion in cost reductions in 2023.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.18-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.10-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 23 new 52-week highs and 12 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 93 new highs and 119 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.36 billion shares, compared with the 11.59 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

418,772,Microsoft,2022-10-27,"Amazon predicts sales growth slowdown for holidays, crushing shares","













Oct 27 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) on Thursday forecast a slowdown in sales growth for the holiday season, disappointing Wall Street and warning that inflation-wary consumers and businesses had less money to spend.

Amazon's 12% extended-trade stock drop erased about $140 billion in its market capitalization, greater than the entire value of companies such as Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Netflix (NFLX.O) and Lockheed Martin .

For months, the world's biggest online retailer has fought against troubling macroeconomic tides. It hosted not one, but two cornerstone sales events in a year: Prime Day in July, and the Prime Early Access Sale this month.

For the summer event, it sold more items than ever before to its Prime loyalty shoppers, and, meanwhile, the company sought revenue from higher Prime subscription fees and a surcharge on some merchants.

Net sales were $127.1 billion in the third quarter that ended Sept. 30, still a little lower than the $127.5 billion analysts expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

But the macro outlook has not brightened. In a call with reporters, Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said the company was bracing for slower economic growth.

""We are seeing signs all around that, again, people's budgets are tight, inflation is still high, energy costs are an additional layer on top of that caused by other issues,"" he said. ""We are preparing for what could be a slower growth period, like most companies.""

European consumers in particular have spent less than their American counterparts, pinched by the war in Ukraine and higher fuel costs, which likewise increased Amazon's expenses, he told reporters and analysts. The company's international-segment operation loss widened to $2.5 billion in the third quarter from $0.9 billion a year prior.

While Amazon would continue to fund earlier-stage businesses like its lucrative cloud-computing and advertising divisions, it would question costs elsewhere and proceed carefully on hiring, Olsavsky said.

Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said, ""It’s possible that retail sales will decline year-over-year. I don’t actually believe that will happen, but the market definitely doesn’t like it.""

Amazon forecast net sales of between $140 billion and $148 billion, or growth as little as 2% from a year earlier. Analysts were expecting $155.2 billion.

Prior holiday quarter sales growth was 9% in 2021 and 38% in 2020.

CLOUD MISSES

Across the retail sector, U.S. online sales are expected to rise at their slowest pace in years this holiday season. Consumer goods company Unilever PLC (ULVR.L) likewise believes ""sentiment in Europe is at an all-time low,"" its chief financial officer said earlier.

Results in the tech industry were just as poor this week for cloud-computing rivals Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, adding to recession fears. U.S. consumer confidence did a U-turn in October.

""Big tech companies are not impervious to slowdowns in the economy, particularly if they are consumer driven,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Jersey. read more

Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's lucrative data-storage and computing division serving enterprises, only helped so much. While it provided much-needed operating income, just like rival Microsoft's Azure cloud, Amazon fell short of estimates.

Amazon's cloud sales growth has ticked down consistently in the past year. Net sales there grew 28% in the July-September period versus 39% a year earlier, when adjusted for changes in foreign exchange.

Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight, said, ""With so much unpredictability there is huge concern, which is impacting confidence among enterprises to invest. In turn, it is hitting the broader cloud sector and companies such as AWS and Azure.""

Facing high inflation and receding consumer demand, Amazon's Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy has raced to control costs across the company's vast array of businesses.

Amazon has slowed warehouse openings and refrained from filling some open positions. It announced it would shut down its virtual healthcare service by year-end, and it is scaling back a long-touted effort to deliver goods via small autonomous sidewalk cars.

Still, worldwide shipping costs grew 10% in the third quarter to $19.9 billion. Amazon's net income also decreased to $2.9 billion in the third quarter, while beating analysts' average estimate of a $2.2 billion profit, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

In a statement, Jassy said, ""There is obviously a lot happening in the macroeconomic environment, and we’ll balance our investments to be more streamlined without compromising our key long-term, strategic bets.""

419,728,Microsoft,2022-10-27,Analysis: Recession fears threaten perfect track record of post-midterm U.S. stock gains,"













NEW YORK, Oct 27 (Reuters) - A potential recession could end a streak of gains for U.S. stocks that has followed every midterm election since World War Two.

Since 1946, the S&P 500 (.SPX) has climbed 19 out of 19 times in the 12-month period after midterm elections, according to data from Deutsche Bank. The midterms, which determine which political party controls the U.S. Congress, occur every four years. This year they are on Nov. 8.

Investors cite a number of possible reasons for the post-midterms tailwind. The vote helps clarify the policy outlook regardless of the result because the make-up of Congress is known. At the same time, the party that wins the presidency tends to lose seats in a midterm election, creating political gridlock that prevents either side from making radical policy changes – a setup investors seem to favor.

Whatever the reason, an extended period of stock market gains would be a welcome development for investors after a tumble in which the S&P 500 has lost nearly 20% year-to-date, spurred by aggressive Federal Reserve interest rate hikes to rein in soaring inflation.

“Performance in the 12 months after midterms is consistent with a positive and above-average market returns,” said Angelo Kourkafas, an investment strategist at Edward Jones.

This time, however, “the driver of the markets has been the Fed,"" Kourkafas said. ""So I wouldn’t necessarily dismiss the midterm election effect but other factors supersede that.”

The focus on post-election performance comes as investors digest a rally that has taken the S&P 500 up over 7% from its recent lows. Analysts have attributed the move to everything from hopes of a coming slowdown in the pace of the Fed's monetary policy tightening to cash-heavy funds jumping aboard market rebounds.

While the focus has been on the Fed, the impending election and broader seasonality trends may be another factor in favor of stocks, market-watchers said.

Oxford Economics data shows that the S&P 500 since 1950 has risen an average of 15% in the 12-month period following the midterm vote, with the rally typically starting a few weeks prior to the election.

Other seasonal trends have drawn investors' attention. November and December rank as the second- and third-best performing months of the year since 1950, with average S&P 500 gains of 1.7% and 1.5%, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac.

In any case, investors have been more eager to buy as of late, evidenced by BofA Global Research data showing three-week inflows into single stocks measured as a percentage of S&P 500 market value near their highest level since 2008.

RISKS TO A RALLY

Still, some believe markets will have trouble mounting a sustained rally if the Fed’s aggressive monetary policy sends the United States into a recession. Economic data and recent earnings results have painted a mixed picture, including disappointing reports this week from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O).

Another recession warning came earlier this week, when yields on three-month Treasuries surpassed those on 10-year Treasuries, a signal that has preceded past downturns.

""Recession outweighs factors in previous U.S. midterm elections that were seen as positive for stocks, such as resulting policy gridlock,"" BlackRock strategists said in a note this week, adding that they were ""not chasing bear market rebounds.""

Meanwhile, the current inflationary environment makes post-midterm fiscal stimulus less likely, another factor that could limit stock gains.

While a post-midterm rally cannot be ruled out, ""I just think that in some ways the environment is stacked against a big return in markets again next year,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.

Still, some investors continue to view the midterms as a potential positive for stocks.

Equities have historically performed better in periods of divided government. With Republicans favored in polls and betting markets to wrest control of the House of Representatives and possibly the Senate while Democrat Joe Biden remains in the White House, such a result may be increasingly likely.

Average annual S&P 500 returns have been 14% in a split Congress and 13% in a Republican-held Congress under a Democratic president, according to data since 1932 analyzed by RBC Capital Markets. That compares with 10% when Democrats controlled the presidency and Congress.

Regardless of the winner, “the policy uncertainty goes away,"" said Brian Overby, senior markets strategist at Ally. ""At least you do know what the agenda is and businesses can plan accordingly.”

420,769,Microsoft,2022-10-28,Wall St Week Ahead Hopeful U.S. stock rally set for date with Federal Reserve reality,"[1/3] Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., October 14, 2022. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid















NEW YORK, Oct 28 (Reuters) - A bounce in U.S. stocks that has defied a barrage of major earnings disappointments faces a key test in the coming week, when the Federal Reserve's next meeting could shed light on how long it will stick to the aggressive monetary policies that have crippled asset prices in 2022.

Betting on a less hawkish Fed has been a dangerous undertaking this year. Stocks have repeatedly rebounded from lows on expectations of a so-called Fed pivot, only to be crushed anew by fresh evidence of persistent inflation or a central bank bent on maintaining its pace of rate increases.

Pockets of softness in the U.S. economy have fueled recent hopes of a tempering of rate hikes, along with signs that some of the world’s central banks may be nearing the end of their rate hiking cycles. Meanwhile, cash-heavy investors afraid of missing out on a sustained rally have contributed to the bullish move, market participants said.

“The market is starting to believe that there is an endgame in sight for this huge global tightening cycle,” said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services.

The S&P 500 was on pace to end the week with a gain of over 3%, as investors shrugged off brutal earnings reports from companies such as Amazon (AMZN.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META.O).

The benchmark index is up over 8% from its most recent low, a move that has been accompanied by a sharp rally in U.S. Treasuries and a weakening of the dollar, reversing trends that have prevailed for most of the year.

A smaller than expected rate increase by the Bank of Canada added to hopes of a peak in global central bank hawkishness, as did comments from a Bank of Mexico board member cautioning against increasing monetary policy to excessively restrictive levels.

While investors have broadly factored in a 75 basis point rate hike on Wednesday at the end of the Fed's two-day meeting, many will be looking for hints of future policy moves in Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference, as his comments have swayed asset prices this year.

For example, stocks rallied ahead of the Fed's conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in August, only for the market to decline anew after Powell warned about economic fallout from the Fed's efforts to fight inflation.

""If his tone is as terse and as hawkish as it was in August at Jackson Hole, that would certainly change the narrative rather rapidly,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth.

Next week will also test whether stocks can continue to weather disappointing earnings news. More than 150 S&P 500 companies are due to report quarterly results next week, including Eli Lilly (LLY.N), ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Qualcomm (QCOM.O).

Investors will also closely watch next Friday's monthly jobs report for signs of whether the Fed's actions have tempered the labor market.

Plenty of investors believe it’s too early to hope for a slowing of rate hikes. Analysts at UBS Global Wealth Management said the Fed has yet to see evidence of cooling inflation and labor market conditions and that they ""continue to think that it is too early to expect the Fed to signal a more dovish stance.""

""Conditions for an equity market bottom, including that rate cuts and an economic trough need to be on the horizon, are not yet in place,"" the UBS analysts said in a note.

Lerner, of Truist, on Friday issued a report downgrading his view on equities to ""less attractive"" from ""neutral"" following the rebound. He said that while stocks have become cheaper on an absolute basis this year, ""they have actually become more expensive relative to bonds given the sharp rise in interest rates.""

For now, however, it appears the bulls are emboldened. One example of investor enthusiasm can be seen in the options market, where the one month average daily volume of S&P 500 puts, typically used for defensive positioning, outnumbers bullish calls by the smallest margin in at least four years, according to Trade Alert data.

""The market is thinking good things,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. ""Jay Powell will either confirm that or dispel that next week.""

421,749,Microsoft,2022-10-28,Analysis: Tech wreck shows U.S. megacaps not immune to corrosive Fed tightening,"













NEW YORK, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Disappointing earnings from the megacap companies that led markets higher for years are cratering their shares and sending a disconcerting message about a U.S. economy that until recently had appeared to be weathering a barrage of interest rate hikes.

Amazon (AMZN.O) was the latest corporate giant to deliver bad news, saying on Thursday that costs might eviscerate profits in the current quarter. Its shares fell 17% in extended trading, wiping $190 billion from its market capitalization.

Amazon's report was the latest worrying announcement from the big tech-focused companies that command outsized weightings in stock indexes and are nearly ubiquitous in investor portfolios.

""From a markets perspective, you have to be cautious going forward,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. ""They're the biggest stocks in the market, and we really haven't had much of anything good come out of any of them.""

Facebook parent Meta Platforms' (META.O) shares were pummeled Thursday after its costly metaverse bets disappointed investors. Earlier in the week, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) missed Wall Street's target for revenue growth in the third quarter as ad sales remained weak, while inflation and a strong dollar led Microsoft (MSFT.O) to report its slowest topline growth in five years.

Even Apple (AAPL.O), whose revenues and profits topped Wall Street targets, on Thursday reported weaker iPhone sales than some analysts had expected.

As of Thursday's close, only Apple's shares - which are down around 18% for the year - have outperformed the 20% year-to-date loss in the S&P 500 . Meta leads the declines with a fall of some 70%.

tech wreck

Many view the growth giants as bellwethers for how corporate America is faring during a year in which inflation has soared, pushing the Federal Reserve to enact a series of jumbo-sized rate hikes that have bruised markets and raised fears of a looming recession.

Their disappointing results suggest that even the strongest U.S. companies are feeling the effects of tighter Fed policy, a soaring dollar and persistent inflation.

The selloff in megacap shares ""indicates that the Fed's restrictive policy is beginning to be felt in the real economy, with growth slowing meaningfully,"" said Daniel Krieter, a strategist at BMO Capital Markets. ""Now we wait to find out if the Fed can achieve a soft landing. It will be very difficult.""

The Fed has already raised rates by 300 basis points this year as it fights the worst inflation in decades. Investors are bracing for another 75 basis point increase at next week's monetary policy meeting, though hopes that Fed officials may soon slow the pace of tightening have buoyed stocks in October.

""Big tech companies are not impervious to slowdowns in the economy, particularly if they are consumer driven,"" said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.

""As the Fed embarks on this planned slowdown, it is eating away at some of their consumer-faced businesses and given their high multiples it is causing big contractions in their stock prices,"" he said.

ERODING PROFITS

Resilient corporate profits have been one bright spot in an otherwise gloomy year, although the recent disappointing results are fueling doubts over how long this can last.

Based on results from 227 of the S&P 500 companies as of Thursday morning and estimates for the remainder, third-quarter earnings are now projected to have risen just 2.5% compared with an estimated gain of 4.5% on Oct. 1, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

""The big technology companies like Amazon continued hiring to support a business that looks like the year 2021, and it's not 2021. It's 2022,"" said Kim Forrest, Chief Investment Officer At Bokeh Capital Partners. ""Layer on top of this inflation. People are buying less stuff.""

Despite the big stock price drops, some investors see more pain for the big tech-focused names.

In a Thursday morning report, analysts at UBS Global Wealth Management gave a litany of reasons for caution, including still-high earnings estimates given elevated inflation and the stronger dollar.

""Even after a significant underperformance by tech stocks so far this year ... we don't believe the continuing headwinds for the sector are yet fully priced into the market,"" they wrote.

422,297,Microsoft,2022-10-28,Tech giants feel pain as cloud spending cuts suggest slowdown,"













Oct 27 (Reuters) - In a further sign that large companies may be girding against an imminent recession, U.S. tech giants Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Intel (INTC.O) said this week that customers were taking an axe to cloud and datacenter spending.

Cloud services for years has been one of the largest and most dependable sources of growth for some of the biggest tech companies, including during the pandemic as people worked and studied from home.

Now investors are looking to see whether there is a glut in capacity that will lead to investment cuts as companies deal with rising costs amid soaring inflation, while interest rate increases have squeezed consumer demand. The strong dollar has been a particular headwind.

Growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS), the firm's lucrative cloud unit serving enterprises, has ticked down consistently in the past four quarters, adjusted for changes in forex.

Net sales in the business grew 28% in the July-September period versus 39% a year earlier, the slowest since the fourth quarter of 2020. They fell short of a 31% average analysts' forecast.

Amazon shares slumped 12% after the bell on Thursday after it forecast a slowdown in sales growth for the holiday season, erasing some $140 billion from its market value and capping a week of dismal earnings from global tech firms.

""The AWS slowdown is a clear sign that businesses are beginning to trim costs, so this will likely put more of a squeeze on Amazon's bottom line in the coming quarters,"" said Andrew Lipsman, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence.

Microsoft's cloud business Azure, which had supercharged revenue growth at the software giant for years, dropped to 35% growth in the July-September quarter from 50% a year earlier, missing estimates of a 36.5% increase according to Visible Alpha.

The company projected another drop in the holiday quarter.

Alphabet's Google Cloud revenue grew 38% in the quarter, beating estimates. That was a silver lining in an otherwise gloomy quarter but a far cry from the 45% growth the company posted a year earlier.

EUROPE, CHINA DRAG

Speaking broadly about cloud deployments from AWS, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O), YipitData research specialist Matt Wegner said: ""We really first started to see (a slowdown) in April ... and it's continued. The European region is a source of weakness.""

Eurozone inflation is close to 10% and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Thursday acknowledged that the risk of an economic contraction is on the rise due to soaring energy prices and higher interest rates.

Intel, which makes chips for data center customers including AWS, said third-quarter revenue from that business slumped 27% and profits were nearly wiped out. The business was hurt partly due to soft demand from Chinese enterprise customers, Intel boss Pat Gelsinger said.

The company cut its profit and revenue forecast for the year, reflecting economic uncertainty that Gelsinger said he expected to last into next year and that it was taking time to ramp up sales into datacenters.

Cloud services typically help companies save money so budget cuts in this sector could be especially worrying, indicating that companies think cost is king going into tougher times.

Businesses usually build out more cloud and datacenter capacity than needed and then wait for it to be absorbed, said Dean McCarron, president of Mercury Research, which tracks chipmakers.

""The ""build more"" happened in 2021 and we've been coasting down since then,"" said McCarron. He added that he expects Intel's datacenter weakness to be bottoming soon ""though there are larger macroeconomic concerns about how much improvement we might see on the next growth cycle.""

Oct 28 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) shares fell about 8% on Friday after forecasting holiday-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates, while its Big Tech peers recovered from a bruising selloff this week.

The online retailer, whose market cap briefly fell below $1 trillion, was last down 8.4% at $101.66, after hitting its lowest since April 2020.

Apple Inc (AAPL.O), however, shone bright amid a crowd of dimming lights in the Big Tech space, as the iPhone maker reported revenue and profit that topped analysts' estimates.

Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta gained between 1.2% and 3.1% after their shares were battered this week following gloomy outlook from the companies.

The Big Tech stocks are on track to lose more than $400 billion this week.

Many view the megacap companies as bellwethers for how corporate America is faring during a year in which inflation has soared, pushing the U.S. Federal Reserve to enact a series of jumbo-sized rate hikes that have bruised markets.

Analysts fear macroeconomic factors, including a strong dollar, will continue to hit Amazon in the near term, however, over a longer period of time, the retailer should be able to bounce back.

""Despite accelerating revenues, Amazon has been cut down to size by the market after missing expectations. Efficiency has yet to return to the e-commerce business,"" Ben Barringer, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said.

While the cloud services segment has been one of high and sustained growth for tech companies, indications for Amazon, Microsoft and Intel Corp (INTC.O) this week point to lower investments as costs rise.

Intel's shares rose about 7% after the chipmaker said its cost-reduction plan includes layoffs and is expected to lower costs by $3 billion next year.

However, analysts are cautious of how the company plans to cut costs.

Cost reductions are necessary, but Intel needs to focus on cutting spending in the right places and keep research and development investments high, Glenn O'Donnell, research director at Forrester, said.

425,65,Microsoft,2022-10-31,No Microsoft remedies in first EU antitrust review of Activision deal - source,"













BRUSSELS, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) has not offered any remedies to EU antitrust regulators reviewing its proposed $69 billion bid for ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) ahead of an expected full-scale EU probe, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday.

The U.S. software company is betting on the acquisition to help it compete better with leaders Tencent (0700.HK) and Sony (6758.T), with the latter being a critic of the deal.

The European Commission, which is scheduled to finish its preliminary assessment of the deal by Nov. 8, said its website was up to date. The site showed that Microsoft had not provided concessions.

Microsoft said it continues to work with the Commission on the next steps and to address any valid marketplace concerns, such as those voiced by Sony.

""Sony, as the industry leader, says it is worried about Call of Duty, but we've said we are committed to making the same game available on the same day on both Xbox and PlayStation,"" Microsoft said in a statement.

Companies typically do not offer remedies during the EU preliminary review when they know regulators subsequently intend to open a four-month long investigation.

426,506,Microsoft,2022-10-31,"Cyber officials from 37 countries, 13 companies to meet on ransomware in Washington","













WASHINGTON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - The White House will host officials from 37 countries and 13 global companies in Washington this week to address the growing threat of ransomware and other cyber crime, including the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, a senior U.S. official said.

The in-person meeting follows last year's virtual inaugural meeting of the informal Counter-Ransomware Initiative, adding seven more countries and bringing in a diverse group of private sector players for the first time.

The White House hopes the meeting will allow participating countries to ""institute a set of cyber norms that are recognized across the globe to counter criminal ransomware threats and hold malicious actors accountable,"" the official said.

Participants plan to issue a joint statement at the end of the meeting on Tuesday, including a pledge to redouble efforts to bring pressure on Russia and other countries that harbor ransomware attackers, the official said.

One key topic for discussion will be how to disrupt such attacks, counter the illicit movement of cryptocurrencies and build resilience against such attacks, the official said.

""So less about Russia, more about how we as a set of countries make it harder, costlier, riskier for ransom actors to operate,"" the official said.

Ransomware attacks have increased sharply in recent years, with over 4,000 attacks reported outside the United States over the last 18 months alone, the official said, adding that there had also been progress in arresting attackers.

Ransom software works by encrypting victims' data, with hackers offering the victim a key in return for cryptocurrency payments that can run as high as millions of dollars.

Top administration officials, including FBI Director Chris Wray, Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman will address the meeting.

Countries participating in addition to the United States include: Australia, Austria, Belgium Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Estonia, European Commission, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Lithuania, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway Poland, South Korea, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates and Britain.

Russia, Belarus and other countries believed to harbor attackers will not participate.

Companies participating include Crowdstrike, Mandiant, Cyber Threat Alliance, Microsoft, Cybersecurity Coalition, Palo Alto, Flexxon, SAP, Institute for Security + Technology, Siemens, Internet 2.0, Tata – TCS, and Telefonica, the White House said.

427,442,Microsoft,2022-11-01,Sony hikes FY profit forecast by 4.5% on foreign exchange boost,"Summary

Summary Companies Gaming unit booked higher costs from development, acquisitions

Sold 3.3 mln PS5 units, same as a year earlier

Produced over 6.5 mln PS5 units during the quarter















TOKYO, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Sony Group Corp (6758.T) hiked its full-year operating profit forecast on Tuesday by 4.5% to 1.16 trillion yen ($7.84 billion) as the boost from foreign exchange fluctuations at units including the music business offset gaming weakness.

Sony trimmed its full-year profit forecast for the games business by 12% to 225 billion yen citing lower software sales from third-party developers and the impact of dollar-denominated costs.

Sony's shares have fallen by almost a third so far this year as investors fret about the strength of the games business amid competition from Xbox maker Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and after a fading boost from stuck-at-home consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The gaming business recorded a 49% fall in second quarter profit to 42.1 billion yen after booking higher costs from game development and acquisitions. It sold 3.3 million units of its PlayStation 5 (PS5) console in the second quarter, equal to the year ago sales. The group has hiked the price of its console in markets including Europe and Japan as the dollar strengthens.

The conglomerate has said it plans to ramp up production of the PS5, which has been affected by supply chain snarls, and broaden its games portfolio on other platforms.

Sony Chief Financial Officer Hiroki Totoki said the group produced over 6.5 million PS5 units during the quarter ahead of the key year-end shopping season.

The conglomerate aims to sell more than 18 million units this financial year that ends in March 2023. It sold 11.5 million units during the prior year.

While major industry releases have been pushed back to 2023, Sony launched a remake of the PS5 game ""The Last of Us"" in September with ""God of War Ragnarok"" due for release in November.

Sony reported overall group operating profit rose 8% to 344 billion yen in the July-September quarter, beating analyst estimates.

Sony's shares closed up 0.6% ahead of the earnings release in line with the benchmark index (.N225).

428,716,Microsoft,2022-11-01,Cryptoverse: Bitcoin wants to break its bond with stocks,"













Nov 1 (Reuters) - After months of tears and tantrums, bitcoin wants to split up with stock markets.

The cryptocurrency, which has been closely correlated with tech stocks for much of its torrid 2022, is staging one of its strongest efforts yet to break away.

Its 30-day correlation with the Nasdaq (.IXIC) slid to 0.26 last week, its level lowest since early January, where a measure of 1 indicates the two assets are moving in lock step.

The correlation, which shows the degree to which the two move in sync with each other over a 30-day period, has hovered above 0.75 for much of the year and at times has approached perfect unison - at 0.96 and 0.93 in May and September.

For some crypto backers, any bitcoin break-up from Big Tech is a sign of strength.

""The latter's growth has been somewhat tapped out, and investors are looking for the next growth industry. Bitcoin and crypto is one of those 'next' growth industries,"" said Santiago Portela, CEO of FITCHIN, a Web3 gaming ecosystem.

The nascent uncoupling does indeed coincide with a period of comparative calm and consolidation for the teenage cryptocurrency a year after it began its epic nosedive from the heady heights of $69,000 hit in November last year.

Bitcoin is hovering near one-month highs around $20,500 and rose over 5% last week, outperforming the Nasdaq's 2% gain as dour quarterly results from Microsoft (MSFT.O), Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Meta (META.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) weighed.

HODLERS HOLDING OUT

The crypto winter has been cold and hard, though.

The total market cap for cryptocurrencies has shrunk by more than two-thirds to $984 billion from nearly $3 trillion in November 2021, according to CoinMarketCap.com.

Market participation has also dwindled, with the average daily trading volume of digital asset products falling to $61.3 million as of Oct. 25, far from the daily volumes of around $700 million seen last November, CryptoCompare data shows.

Nonetheless, months of persistent selling has failed to shake out the old hands, who are digging in despite a grim economic backdrop.

The dollar wealth held in bitcoins that haven't been traded for three months or more is at an all-time-high, indicating accumulation by long-term holders or ""HODLers"", according to blockchain data firm Glassnode. The name for that group of diehard crypto investors emerged years ago from a trader misspelling ""hold"" on an online forum.

Furthermore, a record 55,000 bitcoin were withdrawn from the largest exchange Binance on Oct. 26, according to analytics platform CryptoQuant showed, flows that typically signal coins are moving to wallets for longer-term storage.

""The holder base of BTC has changed drastically from being heavily weighted towards speculators, which largely came in in 2021, to the near cult-like 'HODLer' community which would not sell their BTC in almost any macro circumstance,"" said Stéphane Ouellette, CEO at crypto derivatives provider FRNT Financial.

""The market is now looking to the Fed meeting next week for further confirmation of the risk asset/BTC correlation breakdown.""

NEXT FOR FICKLE BITCOIN?

Samuel Reid, CEO of consulting firm Geometric Energy Corporation said heavy outflows from exchanges could potentially indicate some large buyers were ""sniffing out"" the end of the bear market.

Yet it's anyone's guess whether fickle bitcoin will begin to rally, or slide anew, or if it will swiftly rebound to the embrace of technology stocks.

For the foreseeable future, macroeconomics remain the driver of a market that remains highly speculative in nature.

""The more speculative crypto is, the more it is tied to macro,"" said Alex Miller, CEO of blockchain firm Hiro Systems.

""It comes back to, what are the use cases and what's the productive capability of the asset? The more it's being used for other things, the less it'll be tied to macro.""

429,432,Microsoft,2022-11-01,China aims to ship 25 million virtual reality devices by 2026,"













HONG KONG, Nov 1 (Reuters) - China released its first action plan dedicated to virtual reality on Tuesday, with an aim its industry ship more than 25 million devices with a value exceeding 350 billion yuan ($48.20 billion) by 2026.

It was published by five ministries in Beijing, led by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and categorised virtual reality as a key industry for the digital economy under the country's 14th five-year plan.

The paper includes augmented reality and mixed reality in its definition of virtual reality.

This first action plan reflects Beijing’s ambition to lead the world in virtual technology and sets detailed goals.

It did not specify whether the 25 million devices target referred to annual or accumulative shipments between now and 2026.

In the first half of this year, China shipped just over half a million virtual reality and augmented reality devices, research firm IDC said.

The plan also includes a target to increase the total value of the industry to more than 350 billion yuan, which the ministries say includes hardware and software sales.

It added that China will need to nurture 100 core companies and form 10 public service platforms for the industry by 2026.

The China Academy of Information and Communications, a state-backed think tank, published a report on Tuesday saying that China's motivation for the action plan should be seen in the context of the U.S. and South Korea governments having identified virtual reality as an important industry.

It also makes reference to global tech giants including Meta (META.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Google (GOOGL.O) and Tencent , citing them as companies rapidly pursuing virtual reality opportunities.

LISBON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - In an emotional appeal, Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska urged tech workers from around the world on Tuesday to create innovations to stop Russia and help save people in her war-torn country.

""The dystopias we read about in science fiction novels ... are much closer than you think,"" Zelenska told a packed venue at the opening event of Europe's largest tech conference, Lisbon's Web Summit, as she showed a video of the aftermath of a drone attack in Kyiv.

""Russia puts technology at the service of terror.""

Describing technology as a ""battlefield"" in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Zelenska said that technological equipment such as drones and missiles were being used to ""kill people,"" not to save them.

As some among the crowd held Ukrainian flags, Zelenska, the wife of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asked those in attendance to come up with ideas to ""stop the terror, save people and restore the destroyed.""

""You can help us stop the list of terrorism victims from expanding,"" she said. ""I believe that such technology is the future ... if it's not, there simply won't be a future to look forward to.""

Russian forces swept into Ukraine in February in what Moscow calls a ""special military operation"" to eliminate dangerous nationalists and protect Russian-speakers. Kyiv calls Moscow's military action an unprovoked imperialist land grab.

The conflict has killed thousands, displaced millions and reopened Cold War-era divisions.

""They (Russia) are attacking our power plants, there are blackouts everywhere in the country ... now, every day, we have no electricity, no communications and no internet for hours,"" Zelenska said.

She said her country was no longer able to invest in high technology in places such as schools because it must buy generators instead.

More than 70,000 people are expected to attend the summit, which kicked off on Tuesday and will feature over 900 speakers ranging from Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) vice chairman, Brad Smith, to Changpeng Zhao, founder of cryptocurrency exchange Binance.

Web Summit's boss, Paddy Cosgrave, told Reuters last week that 59 Ukrainian start-ups would attend the event. Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's vice prime minister who also runs the ministry of digital transformation, will also speak.

431,410,Microsoft,2022-11-01,"EA lowers bookings expectation on strong dollar, gaming slowdown","













Nov 1 (Reuters) - Electronic Arts Inc (EA.O) lowered its annual bookings forecast on Tuesday as the publisher of ""FIFA"" and ""Apex Legends"" struggles with this year's surge in the U.S. dollar and a gaming industry slowdown from pandemic heights.

The company now expects annual bookings - an indicator of future revenue - between $7.65 billion and $7.85 billion, compared with $7.90 billion to $8.10 billion earlier.

After a meteoric rise during the pandemic, videogame sales have been easing this year due to a lack of major releases and lower spending by consumers facing decades-high inflation.

That, coupled with the industry's prolonged supply-chain challenges, also pressured quarterly revenue from Sony Corp's (6758.T) PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Xbox content and services.

Overall, the gaming market is expected to grow just 2% in 2022, according to data from research firm Newzoo, a far cry from 2020's 23% jump.

A near 17% rise in the U.S. dollar this year has also stifled growth, with EA forecasting a roughly $200 million hit to annual bookings. The company earns more than half of its revenue from outside the United States.

Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said ""poor mobile execution"" was also a concern.

""They haven't efficiently integrated their big mobile acquisitions and bought games that were in decline when they closed Glu, Codemasters and Playdemic.""

EA had no major releases for most of the year, but it could get some support from the October launch of ""FIFA 23"" - the latest installment in its popular soccer franchise.

""FIFA 23"" had the best launch week of any game in the series and it looks set for more demand thanks to the soccer World Cup in Qatar next month.

EA's second-quarter adjusted sales of $1.75 billion was slightly higher than analysts' estimates, according to Refinitiv data. Its adjusted profit also beat expectations.

Summary Companies

Companies Law firms Columbia Law says latest capital campaign raised $325 million

NYU Law last year set a record after raising $540 million















(Reuters) - Columbia Law School is the latest law school to wrap up a blockbuster fundraising campaign, with $325 million raised over five years.

The school announced Tuesday that its Campaign for Columbia Law exceeded its $300 million goal with funds from more than 12,000 donors. That money will help the school “more effectively meet the challenges of the moment” and prepare future leaders, Dean Gillian Lester said in an announcement.

Law schools have grown increasingly ambitious in fundraising over the past decade as the cost of a law degree has climbed and schools have expanded their programming.

Columbia has the highest tuition and fees of all American Bar Association-accredited law schools, at $76,088 a year. The average among private law schools such as Columbia is $53,036, according to U.S. News & World Report. Average in-state tuition at public law schools is now $29,601.

Law school capital campaigns vary widely in their goals, depending on their length and the school’s size and alumni base. New York University School of School of Law in 2021 raised $540 million during an eight-year capital campaign, which it said was the largest by any law school in the country. Harvard Law School previously held that record, having raised more than $476 million in a campaign that ended in 2008.

The University of California at Los Angeles School of Law in 2020 announced that its latest capital campaign raised upwards of $181 million — more than the initial $150 million goal. The University of Virginia is three years into a six-year campaign that aims to raise $400 million. It has already raised more than $343 million.

Columbia launched its now-concluded fundraising push in 2017 with a black-tie gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Microsoft Corp president and chief legal officer Brad Smith and his wife Kathy Surace-Smith, who is senior vice president of NanoString Technologies Inc, co-chaired the campaign alongside Sullivan & Cromwell partner Alison Ressler.

The funding has been used to create 104 endowed student scholarships; add 12 named professorships; and hire six additional clinical faculty. The school also plans a renovation of its library that will expand study space. It has raised $25 million to date for that project, including a $17.5 million gift from alumna Alia Tutor.

(CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Columbia Law plans a $25 million renovation of it's library. That is the amount the school has raised to date. It has not released the projected cost of the renovation. The story has also been updated to include Kathy Surace-Smith as a co-chair of the capital campaign.)

433,448,Microsoft,2022-11-02,AMD shares rise as chip demand from data centers cushions PC slowdown,"













Nov 2 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) snatched more market share in the lucrative data center business from rival Intel Corp (INTC.O) in the third quarter, drawing praise from Wall Street analysts on Wednesday.

Its shares surged more than 3% in early trading as growth in demand for chips used in server processors helped AMD cushion a slump in the personal computer market, which makes up nearly a third of its revenue.

""(AMD) is delivering on their datacenter story, and Intel's rolling collapse has removed some of the constraints on the narrative,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a note.

AMD forecast a 14% rise in fourth-quarter sales, which although below market expectations, was in sharp contrast to an expected sales decline at Intel and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O).

Reuters Graphics

""We expect AMD's share gains to continue, as the company's upcoming, next-generation server CPUs are expected to outperform Intel's lineup across price/performance metrics,"" YipitData analyst Nathaniel Harmon said.

However, growth in the data center business too is slowing as its clients Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) have warned of a moderation in demand for cloud and data centers due to rising inflation.

Reuters Graphics

Also, a recovery in the PC business seems distant, with Chief Executive Lisa Su saying that AMD expects the market will decline by another 10% in 2023.

Even in a weak PC market, some analysts said, AMD was under-shipping chips to clear up the supply chain and this could result in revenue gain next year.

""The team is significantly under-shipping to PC consumption to help flush channel inventories, which should help client revenues to start to inflect to the upside,"" according to J.P. Morgan analysts.

AMD's shares were trading at $61.58. They have lost more than half of their market value so far this year.

434,122,Microsoft,2022-11-02,Microsoft's president warns of talent shortage for tackling climate change,"













Nov 2 (Reuters) - Thousands of businesses will fail to meet pledges to combat climate change unless they start training employees on sustainability, Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) President Brad Smith told Reuters.

Speaking ahead of a report the software maker released Wednesday, Smith said common instruction on issues like carbon accounting was too piecemeal for the roughly 3,900 companies that have vowed to cut their CO2 emissions.

""We have to move very quickly to start to bring our emissions down, and the ultimate bottleneck is the supply of skilled people,"" he said.

Microsoft sells software for organizations to track their environmental impact. Still, companies need more than technology to address global warming, said Smith, announcing plans to develop green education materials including on LinkedIn, which Microsoft owns.

Wednesday's study, by Microsoft and Boston Consulting Group, found that many corporate environmental leaders - 68% - were internal hires whose team members lacked sustainability-related degrees more often than not. The findings primarily stemmed from interviews and surveys with Microsoft and eight other large companies in sectors such as finance and consumer goods.

It took one Microsoft employee, for instance, more than 30 years at the company moving through customer-support, procurement and other roles before a promotion to lead part of its sustainability team - a time horizon the report contrasted with an expected 11 years before humanity will have released a dire amount of carbon dioxide.

While Microsoft itself has grown its sustainability headcount to about 250 employees from only 30 largely in the past three years, having the right workforce to deliver on its carbon-reduction goals remains a challenge, Smith said.

""That is in part an issue for us because it's an issue for everybody,"" he said. ""Employers really need to step back and take a broader look at their investment in employee learning and training.""

Companies should bring in instructors, pay for continuing education and convene on carbon-reduction strategies, he said.

435,421,Microsoft,2022-11-02,"Logistics startup Flexport plans hiring spree, to double engineers in 2023","













Nov 2 (Reuters) - Flexport, one of the most valuable logistics startups, is looking to add about 400 engineers to double its technical team by next year, a top company executive told Reuters.

The hiring spree, spearheaded by Dave Clark who joined Flexport in September after two decades at Amazon.com (AMZN.O), comes at a time when many big tech companies and venture capital-backed startups are either freezing hiring or laying off employees amid economic uncertainty.

Clark, former consumer chief at Amazon and now co-chief executive at Flexport, said the firm is taking advantage of its strong balance sheet and the less competitive job market for tech talents.

Flexport raised $935 million led by venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and MSD Partners earlier this year at a valuation of $8 billion. It expects revenue of close to $5 billion this year.

""Recruiting has been very challenging for the last couple of years. And we think this is the exact great opportunity for us to go out and start hiring and give people an opportunity to do a reset in their career,"" said Clark.

Founded in 2013 by Ryan Petersen, Flexport enables buyers, sellers and their logistics partners to ship, store and trade goods on its digital platform. It has experienced rapid growth amid the pandemic-led global supply-chain disruptions.

The expanded team will work on building the core product, and improve the tracking system and add more automation to the platform.

Digitization in the freight industry has been under way for years, with capital flooding into freight forwarders like Flexport, but the expense of upgrading legacy databases with digital tracking systems has slowed the transition.

Clark said the tech openings, from entry-level to experienced ones, will be across the U.S. with a focus on Bellevue, Washington, a tech town that houses Amazon and Microsoft.

Flexport currently has over 3,200 employees across the world, and now has a hybrid work policy, requiring employees to work for two to three days in the office.

436,512,Microsoft,2022-11-03,Ukraine trusts Musk's Starlink but looking for other providers too,"













LISBON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Ukraine trusts Elon Musk to continue providing internet access through his SpaceX rocket company's Starlink satellite system despite a wobble last month, but is also seeking additional providers, one of its deputy prime ministers said on Thursday.

Mykhailo Fedorov, in Portugal for Europe's largest tech conference, the Lisbon Web Summit, said Ukraine had discussed Starlink directly with Musk and was confident the Tesla and Twitter boss would not shut the service down in Ukraine.

Starlink has ""worked, is working and will definitely work in Ukraine"", Federov, who runs Ukraine's digital transformation ministry, told a news conference in response to a question about the service from Reuters.

""Elon Musk publicly spoke about this and we had a conversation with him about it, so we do not see a problem in this regard,"" Fedorov said.

SpaceX activated Starlink over Ukraine after Russia's invasion in February and has since provided Kyiv with thousands of terminals, allowing Ukrainians to hook up to the internet in places out of reach of the domestic telecoms system. The links are used both by civilians and by Ukraine's military.

Last month Musk tweeted that SpaceX could no longer afford to provide the service to Ukraine indefinitely - only to backtrack two days later and say he would continue to do so as an example of ""good deeds"".

Around that same time, some Ukrainians complained of outages in the internet service near the front lines, while Musk also angered Ukrainian officials by promoting a peace plan under which Ukraine would cede some territory to Russia.

Fedorov said Russian attacks that had knocked out 40% of Ukraine's energy infrastructure in October had increased the importance of maintaining communications systems.

""One of the reasons why I came to the Web Summit is also to look for new partners and continue to develop and engage with new partners,"" he said.

""Communication is really crucial,"" he said. ""We are working on this issue 24 hours a day. Russia is hitting energy infrastructures and sometimes we don't have light at home for eight hours.""

Fedorov spoke at a joint news conference with Microsoft President Brad Smith, who announced around 100 million dollars of additional technology aid for Ukraine throughout 2023.

""This will enable the government and other organisations in Ukraine to continue to run their services and serve Ukraine citizens through the Microsft Cloud and our public data centres spread across Europe,"" Smith said.

Nov 3 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Thursday it would extend technology support for Ukraine free of charge through 2023, as Russia's invasion of the country drags on.

Microsoft said it would provide additional technology aid of nearly $100 million, bringing its total support for Ukraine to more than $400 million since the crisis started in February.

The company's support ""will ensure that government agencies, critical infrastructure and other sectors in Ukraine can continue to run their digital infrastructure and serve citizens through the Microsoft Cloud,"" Microsoft Corp President Brad Smith wrote in a blog post.

Ukraine has also been the target of numerous cyberattacks by Russia since the start of the conflict in late February, according to western security researchers and senior government officials. read more

A number of companies across Europe and North America have mobilized in offering aid to Ukrainian authorities and people.

438,657,Microsoft,2022-11-04,"Yellen to travel to India, G20 summit as forum struggles with Ukraine war","













WASHINGTON, Nov 4 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will travel to India and the Group of 20 Summit in Indonesia next week to bolster U.S.-India economic ties and to try to overcome G20 divisions prompted by Russia's war in Ukraine, the Treasury said on Friday.

Yellen will visit New Delhi on November 11 to participate in a meeting of the U.S.-India Economic and Financial Partnership and deliver remarks on the two democracies' deepening relationship at the Microsoft India Development Center, where she also will meet with technology sector leaders, according to a Treasury statement.

Yellen also will meet with Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to discuss India's assumption of the G20 presidency, as the group of major economies continues to struggle with deep divisions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine as this year's leaders' summit in Indonesia approaches.

Russia, a G20 member, has blocked the group from issuing communiques with language condemning the conflict.

""For India, we clearly also will expect if the war is continuing, that there will likely be negative continuing economic fallout that the G20 will need to address and clearly highlight Russia's culpability for the war and the fallout,"" a Treasury official told reporters.

Treasury officials said they were continuing to discuss with G7 allies and Australia how to set a price cap on Russian oil exports aimed at limiting Moscow's revenues while keeping Russian crude on the market, but declined to offer a timeline for announcing it.

On Thursday, sources in the coalition told Reuters that the cap will be set at a fixed price that will be reviewed regularly rather than a discount to an index.

While India has become a major buyer of Russian crude, the United States is not trying to pressure India to reduce such purchases, and the price cap was not a major focus of Yellen's trip, a second Treasury official siad.

""So we are not trying to stop countries from purchasing (Russian) oil,"" the official added. ""In fact, we see the biggest beneficiaries of the price cap being large emerging market countries like India, so we wouldn't be pressuring them away from it.""

Yellen will travel to the Indonesian island of Bali on Nov. 12 for a joint meeting of G20 finance and health ministers before joining President Joe Biden at the G20 leaders summit on Nov. 15 and 16, the Treasury said. On Nov. 13, Yellen will participate the launch of a G20-led pandemic preparedness fund, to which the United States and European Union have each committed $450 million, and on Nov. 14, she will participate in a seminar on Indonesia's transition to a low-carbon economy.

In these and bilateral meetings, the first Treasury officials said Yellen will seek cooperation from G20 counterparts in improving the resilience of the global economy as it continues to weaken in the face of high energy and food costs and inflation. These efforts will include stronger debt restructuring efforts and more work to build up food security.

Asked whether Yellen would meet with her Chinese counterpart while in Bali, the official said that Treasury had no specific meetings to announce at present.

""We certainly recognize that the U.S.-China relationship is one of the most consequential ones that we have. While there are competitive and adversarial aspects. There are also cooperative aspects, and we look forward to engaging with Chinese authorities going forward,"" the official said.

439,445,Microsoft,2022-11-04,New York art auction fall highlights include Paul Allen collection and a rare Warhol,"













Nov 4 (Reuters) - The fall art auction season kicks off in New York City next week, with auction houses Christie's and Sotheby's both expecting to bring in record-breaking sales.

Among the highlights is Christie's Paul G. Allen Collection, which includes more than 150 pieces spanning 500 years. The collection, from the estate of the late Microsoft co-founder, includes works by Pablo Picasso, Georges Seurat, Paul Cezanne and Lucien Freud.

""Many of the works in the collection are expected to be records for the artist. Many of them actually were records for the artist at the time that they were purchased by Paul Allen from previous auctions, the Freud being one of them,"" said Christie's Vice Chairman Johanna Flaum.

""We will expect records for Seurat, Cezanne, many of the masterpieces within the collection.""

The estimated $1 billion collection will be sold in two live auctions at Christie's Rockefeller Center on Nov. 9-10.

Then on Nov. 17 Christie's will hold a 21st century evening sale with highlights that include Jean-Michel Basquiat's ""Sugar Ray Robinson,"" a portrait of the legendary boxer.

""Our estimate is in the region of $35 million... This painting is an absolute masterpiece by the artist,"" said Christie's Head of the 21st Century Evening Sale, Isabella Lauria.

Sotheby's, meanwhile, expects to break records with Piet Mondrian's ""Composition No. II,"" estimated in excess of $50 million, and Andy Warhol's ""White Disaster.""

""The Warhol is estimated to sell in excess of $80 million. There have only been three large scale 'Disasters' to come to market in the past 20 years, and each time one has come up - in 2007 and 2013 - it's reset the auction record for Andy Warhol,"" said Sotheby's Head of Contemporary Art for the Americas, David Galperin.

Sotheby's Modern Art Evening Auction will be held on Nov. 14, followed by a Contemporary Evening Auction on Nov. 16.

""There are so many amazing works on offer,"" Sotheby's head of impressionist and modern art for the Americas, Julian Dawes, said. ""I certainly feel that we will see a very strong market this fall.""

440,760,Microsoft,2022-11-04,Lisbon tech schmooze takes baby steps to reality,"













LISBON, Nov 4 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tech bubbles are bursting everywhere. Web Summit, the sector’s annual bash held in Lisbon, is doing the opposite. Volumes of newly mask-free attendees to the event co-founded by Paddy Cosgrave in Dublin a decade ago have returned to their pre-pandemic levels of over 70,000, compared to some 40,000 last year.

Some things are as they were. Web Summit-goers still get to gawp at Boston Dynamics’ robotic dogs and quaff wine served from midday in some parts of the Altice Arena. And the usual welter of tech companies, investors and celebrities are still milling around. Binance’s Changpeng Zhao, Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood, Uber Technologies (UBER.N) whistleblower Mark MacGann and Formula 1 legend Toto Wolff were all pressing the flesh. So was Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, and Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, even if the intrusion of 2022’s war-torn reality created an awkward moment when organisers rescinded an invitation for speakers from The Grayzone, a website that has published content critical of the Ukrainian government.

The reality of tech’s big implosion in 2022 was not exactly writ large in Lisbon, though. The shaven-headed Zhao opined on stage that crypto was probably the only stable thing in a volatile and uncertain economic environment. The Binance boss, who just invested $500 million in Elon Musk’s buyout of Twitter, was presumably referring to crypto technology rather than the price of digital assets: bitcoin has fallen 60% this year.

Others were also keen to show they weren’t panicking. Only 8% of venture capitalists surveyed by PitchBook at the conference said they planned to significantly pull back on investing due to rising inflation rates. The recent big falls in Big Tech share prices also didn’t appear high up the list of worries for investors and startups. On the contrary, some still see Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta Platforms (META.O), which has lost more than $700 billion of its market value since September last year while doubling up on building the so-called metaverse, as a potential winner. “What if he is right?” Lightspeed Venture Partners’ Anand Iyer told Breakingivews.

In one sense, Web Summiteers can afford to inhabit an alternate reality for a while longer. Investors may own a slew of assets that are worth less than they were, but company balance sheets remain flush with cash after a record amount of funding rounds in the past two years. Fintech firms Revolut and Checkout.com said they were in no hurry to go public or raise cash, which is just as well given the valuation plunge Klarna endured when it did its own “down round”. And PitchBook data shows U.S. venture capital funds’ uninvested capital is now $290 billion, the highest since 2006.

Still, there are tangible signs that some things have changed. After two years of investing virtually in cash-burning startups, investors told Breakingviews that they now find it riskier to invest in the outfits of people that they haven’t spent time with. In other words, a degree of arguably much-needed due diligence is back in. Meanwhile, fundraising activity hit a two-year low at the end of September, according to KPMG. Privately held fintech Stripe, which in the summer lowered its valuation to $74 billion, on Thursday announced layoffs and admitted it had spent way too much in the past two years. It won’t be the last.

That new strain of reality-based tech investing has a lot further to go, though. The relative lack of investor focus at Web Summit on new technologies that could really move the dial, such as ways to ease climate change, is striking. The number of panels still obsessing about the metaverse, blockchain and cryptocurrencies is still way more than those focusing on the likes of climate technology. Part of the reason for that may be that many crypto supporters have in the past year flocked to Portugal because the government does not tax profits made from virtual currencies, like they do in Italy and France.

For his part, Microsoft (MSFT.O) President Brad Smith believes that the climate tech sector is gaining traction. The sector, Smith told Breakingviews, will increasingly “influence what people talk about and who comes to Web Summit”. The smartest venture capitalists attending this year’s shindig will have taken note and will already be investing now, while valuations are still cheap.

Summary Companies Meta Platforms rallies after report of job cuts

Apple slips as COVID-19 curbs crimp iPhone production in China

Indexes close: S&P 500 +0.96%, Nasdaq +0.85%, Dow +1.31%















Nov 7 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply higher Monday as investors focused on Tuesday's midterm elections that will determine control of Congress, while shares of Meta Platforms jumped on a report of job cuts at the Facebook parent.

Republicans are favored to win a majority in the House of Representatives in the elections, with the Senate rated a toss-up by nonpartisan forecasters. Republicans could use a majority in either chamber to hinder Democratic President Joe Biden's agenda.

""The likelihood that the Republicans take the House or the Senate is pretty high, therefore guaranteeing some form of gridlock over the next couple of years. That would probably take tax hikes off the table, and any sort of big spending potentially perceived as inflationary off the table,"" said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategy analyst at Baird.

Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) jumped over 6% following a report that the company was planning to begin large-scale layoffs this week. The stock has slumped more than 70% so far this year.

Recently beaten-down shares of Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) each rallied more than 2% and contributed heavily to the S&P 500's gain for the session.

Focus this week will also be on U.S. consumer prices data for October, due out on Thursday, for clues about how much the U.S. Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate hikes are helping cool down the economy.

Four Fed policymakers on Friday indicated they would consider a smaller rate hike at their next policy meeting, despite new data showing another month of robust job gains and only small signs of progress in lowering inflation.

Traders are divided about whether the Fed will raise interest rates by 50 basis points or 75 basis points at the U.S. central bank's meeting in December.

""All else equal, whether the terminal rate sits at 4.5%, 5% or beyond, monetary policy is poised to have a negative effect on the economy heading into 2023,"" Glenmede's investment strategists wrote in a note on Monday.

Unofficially, the S&P 500 climbed 0.96% to end the session at 3,806.90 points.

The Nasdaq gained 0.85% to 10,564.52 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.31% to 32,827.00 points.

S&P 500 by market cap

Of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes, eight rose, led by communication services (.SPLRCL) which was up 1.83%, followed by a 1.73% gain in energy (.SPNY).

All the three major U.S. indexes have slumped this year, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq (.IXIC) down 33% due to worries that aggressive monetary policy tightening could cripple the U.S. economy.

Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC.O) surged 66% after former U.S. President Donald Trump hinted at another White House bid. The blank-check firm has agreed to take social-media startup Trump Media & Technology Group Corp public.

Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) gained 4.1% after VillageMD, a primary care provider backed by the pharmacy chain, said it will acquire Summit Health in a deal valued at nearly $9 billion.

Advancing issues outnumbered falling ones within the S&P 500 (.AD.SPX) by a 2.8-to-one ratio.

The S&P 500 posted 18 new highs and 15 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 93 new highs and 221 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was relatively light, with 10.5 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 11.8 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.

443,34,Microsoft,2022-11-08,Microsoft faces new EU antitrust complaint on cloud computing practices,"













BRUSSELS, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) faces a new antitrust complaint over its cloud computing practices as trade group CISPE, whose members include Amazon (AMZN.O), took its grievance to European Union antitrust regulators on Wednesday.

CISPE has alleged that Microsoft's new contractual terms imposed on Oct. 1 together with other practices are irreparably damaging the European cloud computing ecosystem.

Amazon is the market leader in the cloud computing sector, followed by Microsoft and Alphabet unit Google .

""Leveraging its dominance in productivity software, Microsoft restricts choice and inflates costs as European customers look to move to the cloud, thus distorting Europe's digital economy,"" CISPE secretary general Francisco Mingorance said in a statement.

The company uses its dominance in productivity software to direct European customers to its Azure cloud infrastructure to the disadvantage of European rivals, CISPE alleged in its complaint to the European Commission.

It alleged that Microsoft's anti-competitive practices included discriminatory bundling and tying of its products, self-preference pricing and locking in customers both on the technical and competitive level.

Microsoft, which has been fined more than 1.6 billion euros ($1.6 billion) by the Commission in the previous decade for various antitrust violations, said it is committed to addressing valid licensing concerns and supporting a competitive environment.

""The licensing changes we introduced in October give customers and cloud providers around the world even more options for running and offering our software in the cloud,"" a spokesperson said.

Cloud service providers in Germany, Italy, Denmark and France, two of whom are members of CISPE, have filed similar complaints with the Commission in the past couple of years.

Microsoft subsequently amended licensing deals and other changes to make it easier for cloud service providers to compete starting Oct. 1 in a bid to stave off EU antitrust concerns.

Rivals Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google, Alibaba (9988.HK) and Microsoft's own cloud services however are excluded from the changes.

CISPE said the EU competition watchdog should tackle the issue by applying the trade body's principles of fair software licensing devised last year to Microsoft.

It said an independent European Observatory could be set up to audit dominant software companies' licensing terms.

The Commission could also add another provision to newly adopted tech rules, known as the Digital Markets Act, prohibiting cloud computing gatekeepers from favouring their software applications, CISPE said.

U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee via REUTERS//File Photo















Nov 8 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) will begin laying off employees on Wednesday morning, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told hundreds of executives on Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Zuckerberg appeared downcast in Tuesday's meeting and said he was accountable for the company's missteps and his overoptimism about growth had led to overstaffing, the report added, citing people familiar with the matter.

He described broad cuts and specifically mentioned the recruiting and business teams as among those facing layoffs, the report said, adding an internal announcement of the company's layoff plans is expected around 6 a.m. Eastern time on Wednesday.

The specific employees losing their jobs will be informed over the course of the morning, the report said.

Meta's head of human resources, Lori Goler, said employees who lose their jobs will be provided with at least four months of salary as severance, the WSJ reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Meta reported more than 87,000 employees at the end of September.

The company declined to comment on the report.

The development comes after Twitter laid off half its workforce across teams ranging from communications and content curation to product and engineering following Elon Musk's $44 billion takeover.

However, Bloomberg on Sunday reported Twitter was reaching out to dozens of employees who lost their jobs, asking them to return.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) also laid off around 1,000 employees across several divisions in October, according to an Axios report.

445,124,Microsoft,2022-11-08,Microsoft's $69 bln Activision bid faces EU antitrust probe,"













BRUSSELS, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) may have to offer concessions to address EU antitrust concerns about its $69 billion bid for ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) after regulators opened a full-scale investigation on Tuesday and warned about the impact of the deal.

The U.S. software company, which announced the deal in January, is betting Activision's stable of games will help it compete better with leaders Tencent (0700.HK) and Sony (6758.T), with the latter critical of the deal.

""The Commission's preliminary investigation shows that the transaction may significantly reduce competition on the markets for the distribution of console and PC video games, including multigame subscription services and/or cloud game streaming services, and for PC operating systems,"" the European Commission said in a statement.

""The preliminary investigation suggests that Microsoft may have the ability, as well as a potential economic incentive, to engage in foreclosure strategies vis-à-vis Microsoft's rival distributors of console video games,"" it added.

Microsoft said it would work with the EU antitrust watchdog to address valid marketplace concerns.

""Sony, as the industry leader, says it is worried about Call of Duty, but we've said we are committed to making the same game available on the same day on both Xbox and PlayStation. We want people to have more access to games, not less,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said.

The EU competition enforcer said it would decide by March 23, 2023 whether to clear or block the deal. Reuters reported on Oct. 31 that Microsoft would face an extensive EU probe after declining to offer remedies during the preliminary EU review of the deal.

Britain's antitrust watchdog is also investigating the acquisition, with similar concerns to its EU peer.

446,717,Microsoft,2022-11-09,"Meta cuts 11,000 jobs as it sinks more money into the metaverse","













Nov 9 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) said on Wednesday it would cut more than 11,000 jobs, or 13% of its workforce, as the Facebook parent doubled down on its risky metaverse bet amid a crumbling advertising market and decades-high inflation.

The mass layoffs, among the biggest this year and the first in Meta's 18-year history, follow thousands of job cuts at other tech companies including Elon Musk-owned Twitter Inc, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Snap Inc .

Like its peers, Meta aggressively hired during the pandemic to meet a surge in social media usage by stuck-at-home consumers. But business has suffered this year as advertisers and consumers pull the plug on spending in the face of soaring costs and rapidly rising interest rates.

""Not only has online commerce returned to prior trends, but the macroeconomic downturn, increased competition, and ads signal loss have caused our revenue to be much lower than I'd expected,"" Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said in a message to employees.

""I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that.""

On a short call on Wednesday that Reuters had access to, a red-eyed Zuckerberg addressed employees but took no questions. He stuck to a script that closely followed the wording in the morning's blogpost and called the increased investments in e-commerce a ""big mistake in planning.""

He said he would host another townhall on Friday in which he would take questions.

Meta, once worth more than $1 trillion, is now valued at $256 billion after losing more than 70% of its value this year alone.

Meta shares rose 4% on Wednesday as investors cheered caution by a company that has been pinning its future on the metaverse with pricey investments that Zuckerberg himself says will take a decade to bear fruit.

""The market is breathing a sigh of relief that Meta's management or Zuckerberg specifically seems to be heeding some advice, which is you need to take some of the steam out of the growing expenditure bill,"" Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Sophie Lund-Yates said.

The company now expects 2023 expenses of $94 billion to $100 billion, compared with the $96 billion to $101 billion projected previously. It also narrowed its 2023 capital expenditures forecast range.

Other than the job cuts, which will impact units across Meta with a disproportional hit to the recruiting and business teams, the company will also reduce office space, lower discretionary spending and extend a hiring freeze into the first quarter to rein in expenses.

METAVERSE CASH BURN

Still, more of the leftover resources will go toward the Reality Labs unit responsible for its metaverse investments. The business lost $9.44 billion from January to September this year, with losses expected to grow significantly in 2023.

The spending spree has drawn the ire of Wall Street and shareholders, with one investor recently calling the investments ""super-sized and terrifying."" Analysts have also questioned how long Meta can pour money into the project in a weak economy.

""They're going to have to continue to rightsize. ... Next year is going to be a difficult environment for them,"" said Paul McCarthy at Kisco Capital, which previously owned Meta shares.

McCarthy added he was skeptical about the company's metaverse bets, and that rising interest rates and a gloomy macro environment could continue to weigh on the ad market.

As part of the severance package, Meta will pay 16 weeks of base pay and two additional weeks for every year of service, as well as all remaining paid time off.

Affected employees will also receive shares that were set to vest on Nov. 15 and healthcare coverage for six months, according to Meta, which had 87,314 employees as of the end of September.

The company did not disclose the exact charge for the layoffs, but said the figure was included in its previously announced 2022 expense outlook of between $85 billion and $87 billion.

447,492,Microsoft,2022-11-09,Shares in Apple supplier Goertek tumble after client suspends order,"













HONG KONG, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Shares in Goertek Inc (002241.SZ) tumbled on Wednesday after the China-based electronics supplier said an overseas client had asked it to suspend assembly work for a smart acoustic product, which analysts identified as the Apple AirPods Pro 2.

Goertek said late on Tuesday it had received the notice from a ""major overseas client"". The suspension would impact up to 3.3 billion yuan ($455 million) in revenue, equivalent to about 4.2% of the company's total revenue in 2021, it said.

Shares in Goertek fell by their maximum, triggering a trading suspension in accordance with exchange rules.

In a note to clients, analysts from Jefferies said their inquiries had revealed that the product was the AirPods Pro 2, a wireless earphone set.

""The issue is more of a technical one, instead of a demand problem,"" Jefferies analysts wrote, adding that both Goertek and Luxshare had been impacted.

Another Apple supplier, Luxshare (002475.SZ), had been able to quickly fix the problem and resume production, but Goertek was still in the process of overcoming the difficulty, working with an Apple engineering team on site, they said.

""At the moment, there are no order cuts or Goertek being so-called 'kicked out' of the customer's supply chain,"" they said.

Ming-Chi Kuo, an Apple analyst at research firm TF Securities, said that, according to his checks, the product involved could be AirPods Pro 2. ""Goertek's suspension of production is more likely due to production issues rather than demand issues,"" he said.

Apple and Goertek, whose clients also include Meta Platforms (META.O), Samsung and Microsoft, did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

Shares in Luxshare (002475.SZ) and AAC Technologies (2018.HK) initially jumped as high as 4.6% and 14.6%, respectively, before paring gains. The two companies were up about 0.3% and 2.6%, respectively, near the end of the afternoon session.

448,439,Microsoft,2022-11-09,U.S. climate envoy Kerry launches carbon offset plan,"













SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov 9 (Reuters) - U.S. climate envoy John Kerry on Wednesday announced the creation of a carbon offset plan meant to help developing countries speed their transition away from fossil fuels.

Kerry launched the Energy Transition Accelerator (ETA) with the intention of funding renewable energy projects and accelerating clean energy transitions in developing countries.

The United States will develop the program with the Bezos Earth Fund and Rockefeller Foundation, with input from the public and private sectors which would operate through 2030 and possibly be extended to 2035.

Kerry said Chile and Nigeria were among the developing countries to have shown early interest in the ETA, and that Bank of America, Microsoft, PepsiCo and Standard Chartered Bank had voiced interest in ""informing the ETA's development"".

""Our intention is to put the carbon market to work to deploy capital to speed the transition from dirty to clean power specifically, to retire unabated coal-fired power and accelerate the buildout of renewables,"" he said at the event launch on Wednesday. Kerry added that the carbon credits used in the program would be ""high quality"" and meet ""strong safeguards"".

The U.S. climate envoy acknowledged widespread criticism of voluntary carbon offset schemes raised by environmental groups and a task force created by U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, which on Tuesday recommended that carbon credits be used sparingly by companies and governments to avoiding undermining their net-zero emission plans.

Kerry said Guterres was supportive of the U.S.-led carbon market initiative provided there were safeguards to it.

The two had met earlier on Wednesday at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt.

Environmental groups panned the initiative, saying that the scheme would delay real efforts to slash emissions.

""A voluntary carbon credit program won’t guarantee deep, real cuts in emissions - it’s tantamount to rearranging the deck chairs as the climate ship is going down,"" said Rachel Cleetus, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

At the event launch, a protester interrupted Kerry saying: ""You’re providing false solutions.”

Kerry responded that fossil fuel companies would not participate in the program.

449,391,Microsoft,2022-11-09,Roblox Corp shares fall on wider-than-expected loss,"













Nov 9 (Reuters) - Roblox Corp (RBLX.N) reported a larger-than-expected quarterly loss on Wednesday, as the gaming platform spent more on hiring and its infrastructure, overshadowing solid user growth and sending its shares down 17%.

Growth has been slowing in the videogame sector this year as more people step outdoors and reserve spending for essential items in the face of the highest inflation in decades.

The company's loss ballooned to 50 cents per share in the three months ended Sept. 30, from 13 cents a year earlier. Analysts were expecting a loss of 35 cents, according to Refinitiv data.

That was mostly due to a 40% surge in total costs at Roblox that is among the key metaverse players and has a much younger audience than most major gaming companies.

The company will continue to hire but ""not quite at the same rate of hiring next year,"" said Chief Financial Officer Michael Guthrie on a call with analysts. Earlier in the day, social media giant Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) announced a 13% cut to its workforce, following similar moves by Snap Inc (SNAP.N), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Netflix Inc (NFLX.O).

Revenue grew 2% to $517.7 million in the reported quarter, and bookings were up 10% to $701.7 million.

Bookings refer to Roblox's virtual currency Robux that players buy that can be used upgrade players' avatars by buying in-game items such as clothing, pet, collectibles or accessories.

The gaming company said it changed the period of estimated paying user life to 28 months from 25 months, which resulted in a $111 million drop in revenue during the reporting quarter. It also resulted in lower costs by $25.5 million.

Average daily active users (DAUs) were 58.8 million at end of the Sept. quarter, up 24% from last year.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Nov 9 (Reuters) - U.S. climate envoy John Kerry announced plans for companies to buy carbon credits to support countries switching out of coal power on Wednesday.

Speaking at the U.N. Climate summit COP27, Kerry said that companies including Microsoft and PepsiCo were involved in the plans, while countries and environmental groups were also supportive. Fossil fuel companies were excluded, however, he said.

451,101,Microsoft,2022-11-09,Microsoft investor seeks report on climate risk of 401(k) plan investments,"













November 9, 2022 - A Microsoft Corp. shareholder is urging fellow investors to support its proposal that the technology giant analyze the financial risks of its 401(k) plan offerings, including its investment in high-carbon companies.

Microsoft Corp. PX14A6G, 2022 WL 16700138 (Nov. 4, 2022).

In a Nov. 4 Securities and Exchange Commission filing, As You Sow said Microsoft should report on its findings, such as whether investing in companies that contribute to climate change puts younger 401(k) plan participants at greater economic risk than participants who are close to retirement.

According to the proposal, plan investments are not immune to the systemic risks posed by climate change, which include physical impacts to infrastructure, supply chains and resource availability.

In addition to these risks, the proposal noted, ""shifting regulatory and business environments will increase the transition costs for those caught flat-footed.""

As You Sow said a recent analysis showed that Microsoft's 401(k) plan invests as much as $2 billion, or at least 5% of total assets, in fossil fuel industries.

The plan also invests more than $100 million in deforestation-risk agricultural commodities, the investor said.

According to As You Sow, retirement plans can be harmed by both physical and transition risks from climate change. Physical risks can include short-term losses from the increased occurrence of extreme weather, while transition risks include costs from policy and market changes that companies need to transition to a lower-carbon economy, the investor said.

Shareholders should support the proposal, according to As You Sow, because the climate risk created by Microsoft's investments contradicts its commitment to reducing its operational and supply chain emissions.

Microsoft has publicized ""ambitious operational climate goals,"" including a pledge to become carbon-negative by 2030, reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions to near-zero by the middle of the decade, and reach 100% renewable energy by 2025, As You Sow said.

As You Sow offered sharp criticism after Microsoft's board recommended that shareholders vote against the proposal.

The investor said the board blamed its failure to manage the 401(k) plan's climate risk on its fiduciary duty under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

But ERISA ""does not require the company to ignore the material risk to beneficiaries' investments,"" the investor said.

The board also argued that it has provided ""access to investment options that take into account or specifically focus on green energy in climate solutions,"" referring to the plan's self-directed brokerage window.

The investor said this assertion amounts to little more than an ineffective delegation of the company's responsibility to manage the material risks of climate change to beneficiaries, adding that self-directed options are seldom used.

Shareholders will vote on the proposal at Microsoft's annual meeting, scheduled for Dec. 13.

Nov 10 (Reuters) - (This Nov. 10 story has been refiled to correct Oracle's inactive stock symbol in the first paragraph)

Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) launched its latest data center chip on Thursday and said Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Azure, Alphabet-owned (GOOGL.O) Google Cloud and Oracle Corp <ORCL.N> would be some of its customers.

The fourth generation EPYC processor, code named ""Genoa"", makes significant improvement on performance and energy efficiency compared with its previous chip, said Chief Executive Lisa Su.

""What that means for enterprises and for cloud data centers is that it translates into lower capex, lower opex and lower total cost of ownership,"" she said.

Shares of AMD soared about 14%, mirroring the rise in peers such as Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) which gained over 13% on signs of cooling inflation. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index (.SOX) surged 8.7%.

Genoa launches at a time when rival Intel Corp's (INTC.O) latest data center chip, code named Sapphire Rapids, has struggled with delays.

""With this latest generation, they (AMD) have made a huge leap in performance not only against Intel, but against their previous generation... so that makes the viability of an AMD-based solution much more real,"" said Bob O'Donnell, an analyst for TECHnalysis Research.

AMD, which launched its first EPYC data center chip in 2017, has been steadily gaining market share at the expense of Intel, making especially strong inroads with cloud service providers.

According to research firm IDC, AMD's market share of chips, which are built on the x86 architecture and used by cloud services, went from zero in 2016 to about 29% last year. Cloud is one of the biggest growth areas for semiconductors.

""IDC expects AMD will stay on track, continue building up market share in public cloud deployments,"" said Ashish Nadkarni, datacenter and cloud analyst at IDC.

453,323,Microsoft,2022-11-10,Paul Allen's art collection hauls in record $1.5 bln at auction,"













Nov 9 (Reuters) - Five dozen works from Paul Cezanne, Vincent van Gogh and other revered artists brought in $1.5 billion on Wednesday at an auction of part of the vast collection of paintings and sculpture amassed by late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.

The total represented the highest amount ever collected at a single art auction, according to the auction house, Christie's in New York. Proceeds will be donated to philanthropic causes in accordance with the wishes of Allen, who died in 2018.

Several of the winning bids smashed previous records for individual artists and many exceeded the expected sales prices estimated by Christie's.

Among the priciest works sold was Pointillist pioneer Georges Seurat's Les Poseuses, Ensemble (Petite version), an 1888 oil on canvas depicting three nude women. It fetched $149.2 million including fees, a record for a Seurat piece.

Cezanne's ""La Montagne Sainte-Victoire"", a colorful landscape painted from 1888-1890, sold for $137.8 million, another record. And a Gustav Klimt 1903 painting, ""Birch Forest,"" set the high mark for a Klimt work, selling for $104.6 million.

Other notable sales included the highest price ever for a van Gogh painting. The artist's ""Verger avec cypres"" sold for $117.2 million. Paul Gaugin's 1899 oil on burlap ""Maternite II"" fetched $105.7 million.

Paintings from Georgia O'Keefe, Claude Monet, David Hockney, Andrew Wyeth and Pablo Picasso also sold, along with sculptures by Alexander Calder and Max Ernst.

A 1905 print of a photograph by Edward Steichen, ""The Flatiron,"" sold for $11.8 million, a record for a Steichen work and nearly four times Christie's highest estimate.

Additional pieces from Allen's collection will be offered at auction on Thursday.

454,594,Microsoft,2022-11-10,Yellen to India: ending Russia's war in Ukraine is a 'moral imperative',"













NEW DELHI, Nov 10 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will tell India on Friday that ending Russia's war in Ukraine is a ""moral imperative,"" but that economic challenges from the conflict and supply strains were drawing India and the United States closer together.

In excerpts of remarks prepared for delivery at a Microsoft India (MSFT.O) research facility near New Delhi, Yellen lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent sharper tone on the conflict after he avoided condemning Russia's invasion for most of the year.

""Prime Minister Modi was correct when he said that this 'is not an era of war,'"" Yellen said in the excerpts released by the Treasury.

""I believe that ending Russia's war is a moral imperative. It is also the single best thing we can do to help the global economy. This is a view that is broadly shared among policymakers of the world's major economies,"" Yellen said.

Officials in India, a country with longstanding ties to Russia, have said they would continue to buy Russian oil at a discount, because this benefits India's economy, despite the efforts of the United States and Western allies to impose a price cap on Russian oil exports.

Treasury officials have said they are not seeking to persuade India to stop buying Russian oil but want to strengthen U.S. ties to India through trade and financial integration.

Much of the focus is to make fast-growing India a counterbalance to China in Asia and a reliable source of goods and services for the U.S. economy.

""The United States and India share an interest in strengthening our supply chains in a world where certain governments wield trade as a geopolitical weapon,"" Yellen said in her excerpted remarks, citing Russia's restrictions on natural gas sales to Europe as an example.

RELIABLE SUPPLIER

Yellen said India is a natural candidate for ""friend-shoring,"" or the diversification of American supply chains away from China and some other countries where they have become vulnerable to pandemics and other disruptions, to ""countries that we can count on.""

The U.S. friend-shoring approach involves partnering with developing countries like India that are seeking to grow local industries and connect them to global supply chains.

She cited a $500 million loan from the U.S. International Development Finance Corp to U.S.-based First Solar (FSLR.O) to begin manufacturing solar panels in the Tamil Nadu region that will boost India's manufacturing capabilities.

""At the same time, it will help diversify supply chains away from China, which currently dominates over 80 percent of global solar panel production,"" she said, adding that some Chinese solar products are produced with forced labor in the Xinjiang region.

""The United States will continue to deepen our business and commercial ties with India as we pursue our friend-shoring agenda,"" Yellen said.

455,638,Microsoft,2022-11-11,Don’t dump on U.S. coal plan. Make it better!,"













SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov 11 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Sceptics fear an American plan to use voluntary carbon markets to accelerate the energy transition in poor countries could amount to greenwashing. But if it is done in the right way it could help developing markets close down one of the world’s biggest carbon emitters: coal power plants.

The scheme, known as the Energy Transition Accelerator (ETA), was launched at the United Nations’ COP27 conference this week by John Kerry, the United States’ climate envoy, in collaboration with the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bezos Earth Fund.

The prize is considerable. The Rockefeller Foundation’s Elizabeth Yee says its modelling shows up to $130 billion could be mobilised by 2030. According to the International Energy Agency, coal power plants each year produce a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions – more than any other single source.

Voluntary carbon markets, in which companies get emissions credits in return for channelling cash to poor countries that cut their carbon output, have often been riddled with fraud and double-counting. Many critics think rich countries should just fork out the cash themselves to close coal plants – or tax fossil fuel companies to get the money.

Unfortunately extracting extra cash, especially from America, is hard – and will be even harder after this week’s congressional elections. So it also makes sense to get voluntary contributions from big companies to help close down coal plants – but only if they are cutting their own emissions as fast as possible. Bank of America (BAC.N), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and PepsiCo (PEP.O) are interested.

The ETA partners have learnt lessons from previous mishaps. In particular, they are promising that the money would be used in countries that set out overall plans for transitioning their energy sectors. This “jurisdictional” approach is designed to prevent new coal plants springing up where old ones have been closed. Nigeria and Chile are keen to take part.

But there are still doubts. One is that the ETA hasn’t set out its criteria for what passes muster as an offset. Why not hitch itself to the high standards already being developed by the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative?

Another concern is that the ETA is planning to use cash not just to close coal plants but also to ramp up renewable energy. Of course, countries need cheap money to accelerate the rollout of solar and wind power. But building a solar plant doesn’t cut emissions in the way that closing a coal plant does.

The ETA partners are open that their plan isn’t fully baked. That’s good. If they listen to constructive criticism, their scheme could help turn COP26’s aspiration to phase out coal into a reality.

Summary Companies Growth stocks lead value, Nasdaq rallies

Nasdaq and S&P 500 gain for second day

Indexes end: S&P 500 +0.93%, Nasdaq +1.88%, Dow +0.10%















Nov 11 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended sharply higher on Friday, extending a rally started the day before after a soft inflation reading raised hopes the Federal Reserve would get less aggressive with U.S. interest rate hikes.

Amazon (AMZN.O) jumped 4.3%, with Apple (AAPL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) both up more than 1% and contributing to the Nasdaq's gain.

On Thursday, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq racked up their biggest daily percentage gains in more than 2-1/2 years as annual inflation slipped below 8% for the first time in eight months.

Declines in healthcare stocks limited the Dow Jones Industrial Average's gain, with UnitedHealth Group (UNH.N) down 4.1% for the day.

""What we're really seeing today is simply a follow-through on yesterday. There's a lot of cash sitting on the sidelines that is being put to work,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York.

""Perhaps it signals some type of bottom being put in the market, some type of line drawn in the sand. But even if we put in a bottom, we're a long way away from setting new highs,” Ghriskey said.

Investors see an 81% chance of a 50-basis point rate hike in December and a 19% chance of a 75-basis point hike, according to CME Fedwatch tool.

Adding some nervousness on Wall Street, crypto exchange FTX said it would start U.S. bankruptcy proceedings and that CEO Sam Bankman-Fried resigned due to a liquidity crisis that prompted intervention from regulators around the world.

The S&P 500 climbed 0.93% to end the session at 3,993.05 points.

The Nasdaq gained 1.88% to 11,323.33 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.10% to 33,749.18 points.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was relatively heavy, with 13.5 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 12.0 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.

Of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes, six rose, led by energy (.SPNY), up 3.07%, followed by a 2.48% gain in communication services (.SPLRCL).

The S&P 500 growth index (.IGX), which includes interest rate-sensitive technology stocks, rose 1.6%, beating the value index's (.IVX) gain of 0.3%.

For the week, the S&P 500 rose 5.9%, the Dow added 4.15% and the Nasdaq jumped 8.1%. It was the S&P 500's biggest weekly gain since June and the Nasdaq's largest weekly gain since March.

Worries about an economic downturn have hammered Wall Street this year. The S&P 500 remains down about 16% year to date, on course for its biggest annual decline since 2008.

U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies rose, with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd gaining 1.4% after China eased some of its strict COVID-19 rules.

Advancing issues outnumbered falling ones within the S&P 500 (.AD.SPX) by a 1.7-to-one ratio.

The S&P 500 posted 22 new highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 102 new highs and 110 new lows.

NOIDA, India, Nov 11 (Reuters) - India’s membership in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) will make supply chains resilient between the Asian country and the United States and help the entire region, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Friday.

Yellen said strong trade and investment, and people-to- people ties make the bilateral economic and financial relationship a critical element to the partnership between the two countries.

""India’s membership in Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, in efforts to make our supply chains more resilient, through what I call friend-shoring, are tightening those ties,"" Yellen said on her first trip to India as U.S. Treasury Secretary.

While India is part of the Biden administration's signature Asian engagement project IPEF, it has opted against joining the IPEF trade pillar negotiations.

Earlier in the day, Yellen visited Microsoft (MSFT.O) research facility on the outskirts of New Delhi, before addressing a joint news conference with Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

Sitharaman said the meeting between the two will facilitate a coordinated policy stance on global economic challenges facing the world.

""Meeting today we lend greater rigor to economic relationship, strengthen businesses-to-business links, and facilitate coordinated policy stance to address the pressing global economic challenges,"" Sitharaman said.

Sitharaman and Yellen will participate in a U.S.-India Economic and Financial Partnership dialogue in New Delhi and will discuss India's leadership agenda for the G20 group of major economies next year.

In a statement issued later in the day, the two sides said they would continue a discussion on climate aligned-finance under the G20 sustainable finance working group.

""We agreed that India and the U.S. should work together with partners to pursue a broad mix of public and private financing to facilitate India’s energy transition in line with its nationally determined climate goals and capabilities,"" the statement added.

NATURAL ALLIES

Yellen, in remarks at the Microsoft facility, highlighted the Biden administration's desire to deepen economic ties with India, saying that both the global economy and the democratic idea were at inflection points.

Her remarks came as control of the U.S. Congress was still undecided after midterm elections on Tuesday.

""The U.S. and India are 'natural allies,' in the words of a former Indian prime minister,"" Yellen said, adding that both had waged similar fights for independence to attain freedom and dignity.

""People around the world are looking to us and asking: can democracies meet the economic needs of their citizens? Can they stand up to bullies and cooperate on the most intractable global problems?"" she said.

""I am confident that we will succeed,"" she said.

Among these actions are goals for India's leadership of the G20, which should focus on the shared priorities for boosting investment to fight climate change, breaking a logjam in restructuring debts for poorer countries and improving access to the digital economy.

""India's G20 year is a chance to accelerate global coordination on debt restructuring,"" Yellen said.

She also said that ending the war in Ukraine was a ""moral imperative"" but that economic challenges from the conflict and from supply chain strains were drawing India and the United States closer together.

The United States was working to strengthen India's ""friend-shoring"" role as a trusted, reliable supplier, she said.

458,784,Microsoft,2022-11-11,Take Five: A UK budget and trouble in crypto land,"













LONDON, Nov 14 (Reuters) - The long-awaited UK fiscal plan is (almost) here and after the ructions unleashed by September's mini-budget, markets are paying close attention.

Chaos reigns in cryptoland as trouble at cryptocurrency exchange FTX resonates, while latest U.S. and China data comes just as hopes of a peak in interest rates grows.

Here's a look at the week ahead in markets from Elizabeth Howcroft, Tom Wilson, Amanda Cooper and Mike Dolan in London, Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore and Ira Iosebashvili in New York.

1/ BUDGET DAY, FINALLY

The moment sterling traders have been waiting for is almost here. On Nov. 17, finance minister Jeremy Hunt unveils the government's fiscal plan.

September's mini-budget from predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng brought the pound to its knees and forced the Bank of England to intervene to stem a rout in the bond market.

Hunt has since junked most of that plan, and signalled some 60 billion pounds ($68.70 billion) in tax rises and spending cuts are coming to plug a gaping hole in the public finances.

UK markets have recouped most of the maxi-losses from the mini-budget, but the outlook is grim. The economy faces its longest recession in a century, as a cost-of-living crisis bites.

Latest inflation and jobs numbers are also on the calendar. Inflation hit a blistering 10.1% in September and there's little reason to expect much of a respite.

2/ CRYPTO CHAOS

The crypto world has been thrown into fresh chaos by a meltdown at FTX, with the fallout reverberating across other exchanges and parts of the crypto universe.

On Friday, major exchange FTX said it would start U.S. bankruptcy proceedings while its Chief Executive Sam Bankman-Fried resigned.

A proposed rescue deal from rival exchange Binance fell through on Wednesday, sending top cryptocurrency bitcoin below $16,000 for the first time since late 2020.

Crypto investors are in a state of shock - FTX founder Bankman-Fried was seen by many as the ""poster child"" of the industry. Investors crypto markets have already taken a beating this year as central banks reverse pandemic-era monetary policy. Concerns are also rising about the future of the crypto industry, which faces an uphill task of regaining favour among retail investors.

3/ THE IT CROWD

This year's Big Tech equity plunge shows little sign of ending - dogged by squeezed consumer real incomes, recession fears and a valuation rethink due to the soaring interest rates that discount their future revenues to today's price.

After warnings about online advertising and streaming services littered the third quarter earnings season, mass layoffs are now emerging. Meta Platforms (META.O) just announced it would cut more than 11,000 jobs, or 13% of its workforce.

That's among the biggest this year and follows job cuts at other tech firms including Elon Musk-owned Twitter, Microsoft, (MSFT.O) and Snap . Big banks too are starting to pare back staffing levels.

Markets are watching closely to see if others follow - and try to gauge whether this is merely retrenchment from over-exuberant, pandemic-distorted staffing levels or the thin end of the wedge that deepens any oncoming recession. Central banks will be watching like hawks too.

4/ BIG SPENDER

Wednesday's U.S. October retail sales should provide markets with a sense of how consumers are faring ahead of the key holiday shopping season.

And remember the Federal Reserve is intent on hiking interest rates to contain hot inflation, even if that means a squeeze on consumption in the process.

September data showed a measure of underlying retail sales rising thanks to strong wage gains and savings, even as the broader number came in flat. Analysts polled by Reuters expect a 0.8% increase for October.

The good-news-is-bad news crowd would likely see a strong number as evidence that the Fed has more work to do in cooling the economy. That outlook is unlikely to bring joy to markets battered by expectations of more monetary policy tightening this year.

5/ BUY THE RUMOUR

Chinese shares (.SSEC) are celebrating Beijing easing some of its draconian COVID rules, including shortening quarantines by two days for close contacts of infected people and for inbound travellers. This comes despite cases on the mainland at 6-month highs and some big cities under fresh lockdowns.

Upcoming data will be a rude reminder of the toll the strict COVID policy has been taking: retail sales are falling, industrial production has been hurt by strict lockdowns during last month's 20th Party Congress, and property sales are in an extended decline.

The glass-half full view sees green shoots in promises the authorities have made on growth and hopes for more policy support. One test is whether China's central bank renews a massive trillion yuan in medium term loans to banks, maturing on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, Chinese leader Xi Jinping arrived on the Indonesian island of Bali on Monday for a long-awaited meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden, ahead of a Group of 20 summit set to be fraught with tension over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The hedge fund cut stakes in most of its portfolio in the second quarter amid losses. read more

The tech-focused investor had logged losses earlier this year as the Federal Reserve's monetary policy tightening and surging inflation weighed on asset prices, triggering a sell-off in the sector.

Tiger increased its stake in Microsoft by 16.4%, or roughly $205 million at current prices, making it its second biggest investment last quarter, only behind China's e-commerce firm JD.com.

It also added 9.3 million new shares of Uber, or nearly $272 million.

The hedge fund trimmed its investments in JD.com Inc , digital banking firm Nu Holdings , software firm Blend Labs Inc (BLND.N) and cybersecurity firm SentinelOne Inc (S.N).

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index (.IXIC) has lost roughly 28% so far this year amid fears of a looming recession and geopolitical turmoil.

Tiger Global also added Pagaya Technologies Ltd (PGY.O) and payments processor PayPal Holdings (PYPL.O) to its investments.

Its portfolio value fell to $10.9 billion at the end of last quarter, or $1 billion below where it was in June. That includes new additions, sales and market decline.

The stakes disclosed in the so-called 13-F filing are as of Sept. 30. The quarterly filings are one of the few ways that funds are required to disclose their long positions but may not reflect current holdings.

461,561,Microsoft,2022-11-14,Squire Patton Boggs launches Dublin office as Irish legal market beckons,"













Nov 14 (Reuters) - Squire Patton Boggs on Monday said it will open an office in Dublin next year, becoming the latest international law firm to expand into Ireland.

The office will open May 1 and will be led by Dennis Agnew, the leader of international law firm Pinsent Masons' transactional team in Dublin. Agnew was a founding partner of Pinsent Masons' Dublin office.

A Squire Patton Boggs spokesperson said the firm is currently looking at space in Dublin's central business district.

Agnew will lead its recruiting efforts in Dublin, the firm said.

""In a post-Brexit world, Ireland continues to emerge as an important center for business activity spanning several key areas of our global practice, including private equity, tech and life sciences,"" global managing partner Steve Mahon said in a statement.

Agnew said in an email that the exact timing of his departure from Pinsent Masons ""has still to be agreed.""

John Cleland, the managing partner of Pinsent Masons, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Ireland's low corporate tax rate has helped draw large technology and drug companies to its shores. Large tech companies, including Meta Platforms Inc, Microsoft Corp's LinkedIn, and Workday Inc have expanded their respective footholds in Dublin in recent years.

Multinational companies employ around one in nine workers in Ireland; last year, the Irish government said the number of people employed by multinationals had hit an all-time high of 275,000 in 2021, up 10% on its pre-pandemic level.

International law firms have followed. Earlier this year, Armstrong Teasdale, a 370-lawyer firm founded in the Midwest, said it was opening a Dublin office. Two London-founded firms, Bird & Bird and Addleshaw Goddard, have also broken into the Irish market this year.

Detroit-founded Clark Hill, which opened a Dublin office in 2018, has twice merged with small local firms, most recently in January. Hogan Lovells and the UK arm of Littler Mendelson both opened offices there in 2021, while Dentons launched in Dublin in 2020.

Squire Patton Boggs was created in 2014 by the merger of Washington, D.C.-founded Patton Boggs and Cleveland-founded Squire Sanders. The firm boasts having more than 1,500 lawyers in more than 40 offices across the world. It is also among the top lobbying firms in Washington.

462,70,Microsoft,2022-11-16,Lockheed gets Microsoft classified cloud to speed work with Pentagon,"













WASHINGTON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Microsoft will provide Lockheed Martin with its first classified cloud as part of a three-year deal, executives said on Wednesday, making it easier for the United States' largest weapons maker to share information with the Pentagon, its top customer.

The secure cloud partnership will permit Lockheed (LMT.N) to avoid some of the repetitive security compliance processes for each new government project.

""Whenever you stand up a new classified program, it takes weeks to months to just get the I.T. in place to do it. And this will speed that whole process up immensely,"" Steve Walker, chief technology officer, Lockheed said an interview, declining to provide an estimate of the project's total cost.

Microsoft has made a ""substantial investment"" and spent more than seven years building the classified cloud being used by the Department of Defense, Zach Kramer, general manager, Mission Engineering at Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said in the joint interview with Lockheed.

""For us, it's a question of expanding the usage of the assets we've already put in (the) market. And really what that does is enable the collaboration with others,"" Kramer said, such as the Department of Defense or, once they join a classified cloud program, suppliers.

Lockheed will use Microsoft's cloud-based gaming, exercising, modeling and simulation tools to test military systems and technologies virtually, saving time and money versus more expensive testing of prototypes or in-person exercises.

The new cloud will also allow the company to identify cyber threats and potential hacks, executives said.

463,116,Microsoft,2022-11-16,Nvidia says it is working with Microsoft to build 'massive' cloud AI computer,"[1/2] H100, Nvidia's latest GPU optimized to handle large artificial intelligence models used to create text, computer code, images, video or audio is seen in this photo."" Santa Clara, CA U.S.,September 2022. NVIDIA/Handout via REUTERS THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN SUPPLIED BY A THIRD PARTY















OAKLAND, Calif, Nov 16, (Reuters) - U.S. chip designer and computing firm Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) on Wednesday said it is teaming up with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to build a “massive” computer to handle intense artificial intelligence computing work in the cloud.

The AI computer will operate on Microsoft’s Azure cloud, using tens of thousands of graphics processing units (GPUs), Nvidia’s most powerful H100 and its A100 chips. Nvidia declined to say how much the deal is worth, but industry sources said each A100 chip is priced at about $10,000 to $12,000, and the H100 is far more expensive than that.

“We're at that inflection point where AI is coming to the enterprise and getting those services out there that customers can use to deploy AI for business use cases is becoming real,” Ian Buck, Nvidia’s general manager for Hyperscale and HPC told Reuters. “We're seeing a broad groundswell of AI adoption ... and the need for applying AI for enterprise use cases.”

In addition to selling Microsoft the chips, Nvidia said it will partner with the software and cloud giant to develop AI models. Buck said Nvidia would also be a customer of Microsoft’s AI cloud computer and develop AI applications on it to offer services to customers.

The rapid growth of AI models such as those used for natural language processing have sharply boosted demand for faster, more powerful computing infrastructure.

Nvidia said Azure would be the first public cloud to use its Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking technology which has a speed of 400 gigabits per second. That networking technology links servers at high speed. This is important as heavy AI computing work requires thousands of chips to work together across several servers.

464,321,Microsoft,2022-11-16,"Amazon lays off some devices unit staff as it targets 10,000 cuts","













Nov 16 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) on Wednesday said it has laid off some employees in its devices group as a person familiar with the company said it still targeted around 10,000 job cuts, including in its retail division and human resources.

The announcement, Amazon's first since media outlets including Reuters reported its layoff plans on Monday, heralded a dramatic shift for a company known for its job creation and added shape to the latest dismissals befalling the technology sector.

Amazon executive Dave Limp in a blog post said the company had decided to consolidate teams in its devices unit, which popularized speakers that consumers command through speech. It notified the employees it cut on Tuesday.

""We continue to face an unusual and uncertain macroeconomic environment,"" he said. ""In light of this, we've been working over the last few months to further prioritize what matters most to our customers and the business.""

Plans, still in flux, to eliminate around 10,000 roles through reductions in more units would amount to about a 3% cut in Amazon's roughly 300,000-person corporate workforce. The company has offered voluntary buyouts to some human-resources staff, the source familiar with Amazon's job-cut plans said.

For years, the online retailer aimed to make Alexa, the voice assistant that powers gadgets it sells, ubiquitous and present to place any shopping order, even though it was unclear how widely users have embraced it for more complex tasks than checking the news or weather.

A project inspired by a talking computer in science fiction show Star Trek, Alexa had garnered headcount that grew to 10,000 people by 2019.

At the time, Amazon touted sales of more than 100 million Alexa devices, a figure it has not since refreshed publicly. Founder Jeff Bezos later said the company often sold Alexa devices at a discount and sometimes below cost.

While Amazon has toiled to encode intelligent answers to any question Alexa might expect from users, Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)-backed OpenAI have had breakthroughs in chatbots that could respond like a human without any hand holding.

Dozens of individuals posted on the professional networking site LinkedIn to say Amazon had laid them off, among them people who claimed to work on privacy for Alexa and software for the company's cloud gaming service Luna.

Following the layoff news, shares pared losses and closed down about 2%.

ABOUT-FACE

The news follows Facebook's parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) announcement last week to eliminate 11,000 jobs, on top of layoffs at Twitter Inc, Microsoft, Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and others.

For Amazon, the cuts sharply contrast with efforts months ago to double its base pay ceiling to compete more aggressively for talent.

In September last year it had marketed 55,000 corporate roles globally during a career fair, an increase dwarfed only by hiring in Amazon's fulfillment centers. In short order, the online bookseller that Bezos envisioned on a road trip not 30 years before had become America's second-largest private employer, with more than 1.5 million workers including warehouse staff.

The turn has been abrupt. The retailer is now responding to sales that could rise as little as 2% this holiday season, compared with a 38% increase two years ago. Amazon's chief financial officer told reporters last month that consumers had tighter budgets in the face of inflation and higher fuel costs.

Its cloud-computing division, a profit engine for the company, likewise has increased revenue more slowly quarter after quarter in the past year, when adjusted for foreign exchange.

Andy Jassy, who ascended to the role of CEO in 2021, has focused on cutting costs and stemming Amazon's 43% share-price drop this year to date.

Under his tenure Amazon announced the end of its virtual healthcare service for employers and pruning of its much-hyped autonomous sidewalk delivery program. It froze incremental corporate hiring as well.

465,571,Microsoft,2022-11-16,Nvidia third-quarter revenue up on strong data center demand,"













Nov 16 (Reuters) - Chip designer and computing firm Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) beat expectations for third-quarter revenue on Wednesday, thanks to strong demand in its data center business on the back of rising cloud adoption.

Data center revenue in the third quarter rose 31% from a year ago, while gaming revenue was down 51% from a year ago. Nvidia shares rose 1% in after-hours trading.

Cloud companies are increasingly using Nvidia chips in their systems. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is working with the company to build a ""massive"" computer to handle intense artificial intelligence computing work in the cloud. read more

As of August, Nvidia's market share of so-called accelerator chips inside the world's six biggest clouds' infrastructure grew to 85%, brokerage Jefferies said in a note in October. read more

While U.S. export restrictions have been a cause for worry, Nvidia's production of a downgraded iteration of the A100, called A800, which complies with recent export control rules, has been a bright spot as it helped lessen the financial blow. read more

And Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said while the export restrictions impacted third-quarter revenue, the decline was ""largely offset by sales of alternative products into China.""

""The export restriction put on by the U.S. Department of Commerce was a blessing for Nvidia as Chinese customers started to hoard its Datacenter GPUs,"" said Summit Insights Group analyst Kinngai Chan, who upgraded the stock to ""buy"" from ""hold"".

While the A800 chip meets the export regulations for China, asked if it also met the spirit of the regulations, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said ""it meets the clear test in letter and spirit"".

There have been questions by chip industry executives on whether Nvidia had cleared the changes with the Commerce Department. Nvidia previously declined to comment on that issue.

Nvidia's gaming business, a segment that once drove its revenue, was hit by weak consumer demand, but also a change in the way Ethereum crypto currency is created.

""This may have contributed to increased after-market sales of our GPUs in certain markets, potentially impacting demand for some of our products, particularly in the low-end,"" Kress said.

Nvidia's GPU chips have been popular for mining crypto currencies but a crypto market rout is also hurting demand. CEO Huang said that going forward he does not expect blockchain to be an important part of the business.

The company's adjusted revenue for the quarter ended Oct. 30 was $5.93 billion. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $5.77 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Nvidia forecast current-quarter revenue at $6 billion, plus or minus 2%, versus expectation of $6.09 billion.

REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann















NAIROBI, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation said on Thursday it was committing $7 billion to Africa over the next four years, as Bill Gates warned that the Ukraine crisis was reducing the amount of aid flowing to the continent.

The Foundation's pledge, which is up 40% on the amount spent during the previous four years, will target projects tackling hunger, disease, poverty and gender inequality. Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, will take the biggest share.

Humanitarian groups in Africa are grappling with the diversion of funding away towards Ukraine, and as Russia's invasion increases goods prices globally, impacting aid operations.

""The European budgets are deeply affected by the Ukraine war and so right now the trend for aid is not to go up,"" the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) told journalists at the University of Nairobi during a visit to Kenya.

""If you take all aid (into Africa) including all climate aid - we'll have a few years where it’ll probably go down.""

Kenya and much of East Africa is suffering its worst drought in four decades.

Drought, compounded by conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic, has pushed more than 10 million people in the region ""to the very brink of a hunger crisis"", the U.S.-based Christian relief group World Vision said this week. The United Nations says it expects famine to be declared in parts of Somalia this year.

Following a meeting with Kenyan President William Ruto, Gates said on Wednesday that the Foundation would establish a regional office in Nairobi.

""Our foundation will continue to support solutions in health, agriculture, and other critical areas—and the systems to get them out of the labs and to the people who need them,"" Gates, who runs the foundation with his ex-wife Melinda French Gates, said in a statement.

The Foundation in 2021 gave charitable support of $6.7 billion and last week pledged $1.4 billion to help the world's smallholder farmers cope with climate change.

468,376,Microsoft,2022-11-21,Zoom cuts annual revenue forecast on slow online business,"













Nov 21 (Reuters) - Zoom Video Communications Inc (ZM.O) on Monday lowered its annual revenue forecast, as the video-conferencing platform expects a hit from declining online business.

Zoom chief financial officer Kelly Steckelberg said during a post-earnings call that the company's online business would decline nearly 8% during the year.

After recording blistering growth during the pandemic, Zoom, which competes with WeChat Work, Microsoft Teams (MSFT.O), Cisco (CSCO.O) WebEx and Slack, is facing a slowdown as red-hot inflation is dampening the spending power of customers.

The easing of pandemic-related restrictions across the world is also weighing on its business as people started spending less time online.

Shares of the San Jose, California-based company, which fell nearly 56% this year, were down 5% in trading after the bell.

Zoom now expects annual revenue to be between $4.37 billion and $4.38 billion, compared with an earlier outlook of $4.39 billion and $4.40 billion.

""Guidance suggests further weakness in both enterprise and online. It is tough to disaggregate how much of this is macro (especially given slowing down in hiring or layoffs in tech) and how much is competition,"" said RBC analyst Rishi Jaluria.

""The focus for Zoom remains on its ability to expand to become a larger platform,"" he added.

The company, however, raised its annual adjusted profit per share to between $3.91 and $3.94, compared with $3.66 to $3.69 forecast earlier.

Revenue for the third quarter ended Oct. 31 rose 5% to $1.1 billion, on the back of a 20% increase from high-paying enterprise customers, the company said.

On an adjusted basis, the pandemic winner earned $1.07 per share during the quarter, compared with estimates of 84 cents, according to Refinitiv data.

469,827,Microsoft,2022-11-21,"Comparing trademark issues in very different industries: fashion, cannabis, high-tech","Law firms Greenspoon Marder LLP Follow















November 21, 2022 - Whether manufacturing high-tech devices, cannabis or high-fashion clothing, companies must remain vigilant about threats to their intellectual property. And, although the considerations may be different, the legal issues are the same. This article will examine three very different industries and the IP issues pertinent to those industries, and illustrate the application of trademark law to each one.

Fashion industry

The fashion industry is highly competitive, fast-paced and seasonally driven. Unlike other market sectors, the fashion thrives on knockoffs. Fashion designs seen on the runway at New York Fashion Week are often copied and sold cheaply the following week. But rather than harm the high-end fashion designers' brand and reputation, the fact that cheap knockoffs are sold actually gives more status to the ""real thing,"" which fashionistas will always covet, thus enhancing the brand's value.

It also is common for fashion designers not only to draw inspiration from the world around them, but from their competitors. So, how do they get away with it? And, does such copying actually translate to increased revenues for the high-end brands? There is no doubt that an entire sub-industry exists in the fashion world consisting of knockoff purses, shoes and other fashion goods.

IP plays a significant role in the proliferation and profitability of the apparel industry, however, largely through trademark law, not copyright. It seems counterintuitive that fashion does not enjoy the same level of protection under U.S. copyright laws as other creative media such as art, literature and film because fashion designs also are creative and original. However, the problem is that to be protectable by copyright, items cannot be functional. Because of that, the basic design of a garment may be copied without legal consequence. A quote attributed to Coco Chanel sums up the point: ""If you want to be original, be ready to be copied.""

This does not mean that the apparel industry is exempt from IP protection, however. Trademarks are widely used by fashion brands to protect themselves from knockoffs (counterfeit products) and other infringing products. For example, companies can use trademark law (in the form of trade dress) to protect visual characteristics of their products, such as color or patterns.

Burberry, for one, has a trademark for its well-known Burberry plaid and aggressively protects it from infringers. Christian Louboutin famously won his hard-fought battle to obtain trademark protection for his red-soled shoes. There is no doubt, when someone sees a pair of shoes with the iconic red soles, the source of those goods.

Additionally, brand names and logos (such as Hermès, Gucci and Louis Vuitton) signify a certain quality expected by consumers, along with the social status associated with such goods. As a result, there will always be consumers willing to shell out a small fortune to buy a Birkin bag. And, apparel companies can still protect their brand names, i.e., their trademarks, through traditional means: cease and desist letters, trademark infringement claims and border enforcement actions.

Cannabis industry

Like the apparel industry, IP issues in the cannabis industry are also tricky, but for very different reasons. As everyone knows, cannabis is illegal under federal law — at least for the time being. And, the laws under each state vary widely. So, what does this mean for cannabis companies that want to protect their brands?

For now, the biggest obstacle to protecting a cannabis brand name remains that cannabis is still listed as a Schedule I drug (the same category used for LSD and heroin) under the Controlled Substances Act. As a result, companies cannot obtain federal trademark registrations for cannabis products. This is because the Lanham Act only allows registration of goods that are lawfully ""sold or transported in commerce.""

Although the 2018 Farm Bill has resulted in an exception for the registration of trademarks for ""hemp"" (i.e., cannabis plants and their derivatives containing no more than 0.3% THC on a dry-weight basis), all other cannabis products are ineligible for federal trademark registration. Also, that bill did not eliminate the Food and Drug Administration's purview over products containing hemp, nor did it remove cannabis with over 0.3% THC from Schedule I.

In addition, companies can file for state trademark registrations in those states where cannabis products are legal; however, that does not grant broader, nationwide protection to companies seeking to enforce their marks in other states where there may be infringers.

One creative way that companies avoid these obstacles is to file federal trademark registrations for ancillary products, such as rolling paper, lighters, ash trays, T-shirts and the like. This concept is referred to as ""trademark laundering,"" when companies file trademarks for which the marks also happen to be the brand names for cannabis products (or strains of marijuana, which raises other issues not addressed in this article). By doing so, in combination with state registrations, cannabis companies can create a patchwork of protection. Although not ideal, these strategies allow companies to assert trademark protections against competitors and, hopefully, deter infringement.

High-tech

An elementary principle of trademark law is that generic terms are not protectable. This means that no company can obtain the exclusive right to use terms such as ""computer"" or ""operating system."" The challenge for companies that sell high-tech devices to the general public, is that they may feel the need to use generic (or descriptive) terms so that consumers understand the nature of the products sold by the companies. In other words, the nature of the products may be so abstract or complex that laypeople need a ""dumbed-down"" brand name in order to understand what they are purchasing. Finding the perfect balance of a brand name that conveys the nature of the good, without clearly describing it, is challenging.

Under trademark law, that is what is called a ""suggestive mark,"" one that hints at the nature or an aspect of the good, which allows consumers to easily connect the product to the mark. One example of an obviously very successful suggestive mark in this industry is Microsoft, which suggests software for small computers.

Clearly, in an industry highly dependent on invention and innovation, patents are an important issue for high-tech companies. However, the ability to sell those products under a strong, protectable brand that consumers identify with innovation, quality and reliability may be equally important to these companies. In fact, as the world economy has become increasingly reliant on online platforms for marketing and sales, high-tech companies must distinguish themselves from their competitors (including those selling cheap knockoffs) with strong, distinctive branding.

Indeed, one challenge faced by these companies in the United States is to stop the importation of knockoffs from Asia, particularly China, where many counterfeit goods are manufactured. This requires the registration of trademarks with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which has the authority to detain, seize, forfeit, and ultimately destroy merchandise seeking entry into the United States if it bears an infringing trademark that has been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and subsequently recorded with CBP.

Therefore, it is crucial to high-tech companies to engage in a comprehensive branding strategy not only to develop and build a strong brand, but to employ proactive, strong measures to protect their IP interests.

Conclusion

Although companies in vastly different industries have diverse issues, concerns and challenges surrounding their IP interests, one commonality shared by all companies — whether they sell handbags, marijuana, or smartphones — is that they all need to engage in broad strategies to protect their brands — from design to garment, seed to sale, or concept to completion — in order to ensure they have strong, protectable trademarks.

In particular, regardless of industry, companies need to use brand names that are non-generic, non-descriptive trademarks easily recognizable by their consumers, for which they can claim exclusive use and prevent infringement. In addition, it is essential that all companies employ aggressive protective measures (such as cease and desist letters, coordination with CBP and, if necessary, litigation) to prevent infringement and counterfeit goods.

470,384,Microsoft,2022-11-22,Zoom shares down 90% from peak as pandemic boom fades,"













Nov 22 (Reuters) - Shares of Zoom Video Communications Inc (ZM.O) have tumbled about 90% from their pandemic peak in October 2020 as the former investor darling struggles to adjust to a post-COVID world.

The stock was down nearly 10% on Tuesday after the company cut its annual sales forecast and posted its slowest quarterly growth, prompting at least six brokerages to cut their price targets.

The company, which became a household name during lockdowns due to the popularity of its video-conferencing tools, is trying to reinvent itself by focusing on businesses, with products such as cloud-calling service Zoom Phone and conference-hosting offering Zoom Rooms.

Analysts, however, say any turnaround in the business is still a few quarters away as growth in its mainstay online unit slows and competition from Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Teams and Cisco's (CSCO.O) Webex and Salesforce's (CRM.N) Slack gets intense.

""Zoom has a fundamental flaw - it has needed to spend heavily to keep hold of market share. Spending to cling onto, rather than grow, market share is never a good place to be and was a sign of trouble ahead,"" Hargreaves Lansdown equity analyst Sophie Lund-Yates said.

The company's operating expenses surged 56% in the third quarter as it spent more on product development and marketing. Its adjusted operating margin shrank to 34.6% from 39.1% a year earlier.

Some brokerages believe acquisitions could help revive growth at Zoom, but Chief Executive Eric Yuan said on a post-earnings call that he continued to see heightened deal scrutiny for new business.

""The game is not over for them but without acquisitions this is a multi-year path to returning to higher growth,"" Needham & Co analyst Ryan Koontz said.

471,118,Microsoft,2022-11-22,Sony to expand Chinese game incubator in Microsoft head-to-head,"













HONG KONG, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Sony Group Corp (6758.T) said it plans to expand a programme to identify and incubate Chinese-made games, in a race with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to tap China's gaming market.

The programme will invest more than 1 million yuan ($140,080) in each game it enrols, and will not only fund small teams but also big teams with dozens of engineers or more, Bao Bo, Sony's director of China game production, said

The Japanese tech giant's plans were made public during an event live-streamed on Tuesday from the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu to restart the China Hero Project programme, which ground to a halt due to COVID-19.

""The scale of the third phase will far exceed the previous two,"" Bao said, adding that Sony will publish some games and its PlayStation Studios will support enrolled projects.

Sony said that it will be the publisher of Lost Soul Aside and Convallaria, two games enrolled in the previous two phases.

The China Hero Project unveiled its first two batches of games in 2017 and 2019 and has supported 17 titles, of which seven have reached the market.

Bao told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday that the new batch aims to include 10 titles or more, and it welcomes games of all genres.

It marks the latest in Sony's years-long approach to China, which ultimately led it to a lucrative exclusivity deal with the Chinese hit game “Genshin Impact” outside of the China Hero Project. Little known before its 2019 launch, it became of the world's most profitable games.

Reuters reported last month that Sony's success with “Genshin Impact” has driven Microsoft to aggressively woo Chinese game developers with big licensing deals.

To accelerate its expansion, Sony announced that it has formed the ""China Game Production"" team to oversee Chinese-made games. The Shanghai branch of Sony's gaming-focused subsidiary, Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) now employs just under 100 people after it entered China in 2014.

Tatsuo Eguchi, president of SIE Shanghai，said the success of Genshin Impact convinced Sony's management that Chinese games are important, adding that Sony is allocating more resources than ever there. He also said that Sony's partnership with Genshin Impact's developer, miHoYO, is going strong.

Sony sells the PlayStation (PS) consoles in China, where people have traditionally preferred playing mobile-based games.

It has sold more than 3.5 million PS4 consoles in China and Jim Ryan, CEO of SIE, said it had sold about 670,000 units of PS5 there since its Chinese launch in May 2021.

Eguchi said that Sony's goal is to sell twice as many PS5 consoles as it had for the PS4 and believed the China Hero Project could help meet this goal.

""We want gamers around the world to better understand the creativity that comes from China. I have always had a dream which is for console gaming to become a regular part of daily entertainment for Chinese people,"" he said.

472,62,Microsoft,2022-11-23,FTC likely to file lawsuit to block Microsoft bid for Activision -Politico,"













Nov 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is likely to file an antitrust lawsuit to block Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) $69 billion takeover bid for video game publisher Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O), Politico reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

A lawsuit challenging the deal is not guaranteed, and the FTC's four commissioners have yet to vote out a complaint or meet with lawyers for the companies, the report said, adding that the FTC staff reviewing the deal are skeptical of the companies' arguments.

The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters.

""We are committed to continuing to work cooperatively with regulators around the globe to allow the transaction to proceed, but won't hesitate to fight to defend the transaction if required,"" an Activision Blizzard spokesperson said. Any suggestion that the transaction could lead to anticompetitive effects is ""completely absurd,"" the spokesperson added.

Shares of Activision fell about 2% in extended trading after closing 1% higher.

Microsoft, maker of the Xbox game console, announced in January the deal to buy Activision, the maker of ""Call of Duty"" and ""Candy Crush"" games, in the biggest gaming industry deal in history as global technology giants staked their claims to a virtual future.

[1/4] Microsoft logo is seen on a smartphone placed on displayed Activision Blizzard logo in this illustration taken January 18, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration 1 2 3 4

Microsoft is betting on the acquisition to help it compete better with videogame leaders Tencent (0700.HK) and Sony (6758.T).

The deal is also facing scrutiny outside the U.S. The EU opened a full-scale investigation earlier this month. The EU competition enforcer said it would decide by March 23, 2023, whether to clear or block the deal.

Britain's antitrust watchdog in September said it would launch a full-scale probe.

The acquisition could damage the industry if Microsoft refused to give rivals access to Activision's best-selling games, Britain's antitrust regulator has said.

The deal has drawn criticism from Sony, maker of the Playstation console, citing Microsoft's control of games like ""Call of Duty.""

""Sony, as the industry leader, says it is worried about 'Call of Duty,' but we've said we are committed to making the same game available on the same day on both Xbox and PlayStation,"" Microsoft President and Vice Chair Brad Smith has said.

A spokesperson for Microsoft said: ""We are prepared to address the concerns of regulators, including the FTC, and Sony to ensure the deal closes with confidence. We’ll still trail Sony and Tencent in the market after the deal closes, and together Activision and Xbox will benefit gamers and developers and make the industry more competitive.""

Summary Companies Retailers in focus as Black Friday sales start

Activision down on likely FTC lawsuit to block Microsoft deal

Apple slips, Foxconn China plant sees lower shipments

Indexes: Dow up 0.45%, S&P 500 down 0.03%, Nasdaq down 0.52%















Nov 25 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq closed lower on Friday with pressure from Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in a subdued holiday-shortened trading session for Wall Street, as investors watched Black Friday sales and COVID-19 cases in China.

Apple fell 2.0% on news of reduced iPhone shipments from a Foxconn plant in China in November as production was hit by COVID-related worker unrest.

The session focused on retailers as Black Friday sales kicked off against the backdrop of stubbornly high inflation and cooling economic growth.

Shoppers were expected to turn out in record numbers to shop for Black Friday deals, but with inclement weather, crowds outside stores were thin on the traditionally busiest shopping day of the year.

U.S. retail stocks have become a barometer of consumer confidence as inflation bites. So far this year, the S&P 500 retail index (.SPXRT) is down a little over 30%, while the S&P 500 (.SPX) has fallen 15%.

Shares of retailers Target Corp (TGT.N), Macy's Inc (M.N) and Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) were mixed, while the S&P consumer discretionary index (.SPLRCD) rose slightly.

""It's such a low volume trading day as most people are at home that I never count Friday after Thanksgiving,"" said Ed Cofrancesco, chief executive officer of International Assets Advisory, in Orlando, Florida.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 4.54 billion shares, compared with the 11.25 billion full-session average over the last 20 trading days.

Starting next week, investors will focus on retail sales, China's newest COVID outbreak and the Federal Reserve's next steps, Cofrancesco said.

Wall street's main indexes have rallied strongly from their early October lows, with the S&P 500 up more than 15% on a boost from a better-than-expected earnings season and more recently on hopes of less aggressive interest rates hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve.

Analysts now see a 71.1% chance that the Fed will increase its key benchmark rate by 50 basis points in December, with rates peaking in June 2023.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 152.97 points, or 0.45%, to 34,347.03; the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 1.14 points, or 0.03%, at 4,026.12; and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 58.96 points, or 0.52%, to 11,226.36.

All three indexes ended the Thanksgiving week with gains, led by the Dow, which rose 1.78%.

Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) plunged 4.07% on a media report that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was likely to file an antitrust lawsuit to block Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) $69 billion takeover bid for the video game publisher.

U.S. stock markets closed at 1 p.m. ET, after Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.81-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.35-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 89 new highs and 83 new lows.

Nov 28 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended sharply lower on Monday after protests in major Chinese cities against strict COVID-19 policies sparked concerns about economic growth, while Apple Inc (AAPL.O) slid on worries about a hit to iPhone production.

Shares of the Cupertino, California tech giant lost 2.6% and weighed heavily on the benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX) index as worker unrest at the world's biggest iPhone factory in China fanned fears of a deeper hit to the already constrained production of higher-end phones.

Rare protests in major Chinese cities over the weekend against the country's strict zero-COVID curbs are exacerbating worries about growth in the world's second-largest economy.

""These protests are just evidence that this is a kind of a moving target where, will China continue to try to really constrain COVID's spread?"" said Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.

""Or will they have more of a 'living with COVID' approach that we've seen in the United States and other countries?""

""We think COVID itself and China's policy is one of the key variables for 2023 that would influence stock prices and investors,"" Hainlin said.

S&P 500 stocks

All 11 S&P 500 sector indexes declined, led by real estate (.SPLRCR), down 2.81%, and a 2.74% loss in energy (.SPNY).

U.S. shares of Pinduoduo Inc (PDD.O) surged 12.6% after the Chinese e-commerce platform beat estimates for third-quarter revenue, helped by COVID-related lockdowns in the country that forced consumers to shop online. U.S. shares of other Chinese technology companies also rose, with Baidu (9888.HK) and Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) each gaining over 2%.

The S&P 500 declined 1.54% to end the session at 3,963.95 points.

The Nasdaq Composite Index (.IXIC) declined 1.58% to 11,049.50 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 1.45% to 33,849.46 points.

With two trading days left in November, the S&P 500 is on track for a gain of 2.4% for the month.

Shares of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) rose 0.6% after an industry report estimated spending during Cyber Monday, the biggest U.S. online shopping day, would rise to as much as $11.6 billion.

Trading was mixed in other heavyweight growth stocks, including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O).

Biogen Inc (BIIB.O) fell following a report of death during a clinical study of its experimental Alzheimer's drug.

Shares of cryptocurrency and blockchain-related companies Coinbase Global Inc (COIN.O), Riot Blockchain Inc (RIOT.O) and Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (MARA.O) each fell about 4% following lender BlockFi's bankruptcy filing, the latest casualty since FTX's collapse earlier this month.

This week, investors will keep a close watch on November U.S. consumer confidence data, due on Tuesday; the government's second estimate for third-quarter gross domestic product, due on Wednesday; and November nonfarm payrolls due on Friday.

Declining stocks outnumbered rising ones within the S&P 500 (.AD.SPX) by a 12.2-to-one ratio.

The S&P 500 posted 12 new highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 93 new highs and 174 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was relatively light, with 9.3 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 11.3 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.

BRUSSELS, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) is likely to offer remedies to EU antitrust regulators in the coming weeks to stave off formal objections to its $69 billion bid for ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O), people familiar with the matter said.

The U.S. software giant and Xbox maker announced the deal in January to help it compete better with leaders Tencent (0700.HK) and Sony (6758.T).

It has since then faced regulatory headwinds in the European Union, Britain and in the United States, with Sony criticising the deal and even calling for a regulatory veto.

The deadline for the European Commission, which is investigating the deal, to set out a formal list of competition concerns known as a statement of objection is in January. Offering remedies before such a document is issued could shorten the regulatory process.

""Ultimately, such a move could secure an early clearance with the European Commission and subsequently be used by the parties before other antitrust agencies,"" said Stephane Dionnet, a partner at law firm McDermott Will & Emery.

""However, it remains to be seen whether the active complainants will validate such concessions (in particular in terms of scope) and if behavioural remedies will also be accepted by the CMA and the FTC,"" he said, referring to the UK and U.S. antitrust agencies.

Microsoft's remedy would consist mainly of a 10-year licensing deal to Playstation owner Sony, another person with direct knowledge said.

Activision shares were up 2% after the Reuters story was published.

The EU competition watchdog, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by April 11, and Sony declined to comment.

Microsoft said it was working with the Commission to address valid marketplace concerns.

""Sony, as the industry leader, says it is worried about Call of Duty, but we've said we are committed to making the same game available on the same day on both Xbox and PlayStation. We want people to have more access to games, not less,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said.

The deal has been cleared unconditionally in Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Serbia.

LONDON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Financial firms in the European Union will have to show how quickly they could recover from a cyber attack as they rely more for key services on 'cloud computing' giants such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google and IBM, the EU said on Monday.

Regulators worry about the speed and scale at which banks, insurers and investment firms are moving critical functions and market operations onto a handful of cloud platforms.

A glitch at one cloud company could potentially bring down services across many financial firms, regulators have said.

The EU Council, which represents the 27 member states, said it has completed the bloc's final approval stage for the new Digital Operational Resilience Act, known as DORA.

Banks and other financial firms already have plans for IT security but more was needed so they stay resilient through a severe disruption, said Zbynek Stanjura, finance minister for the Czech Republic, which holds the EU presidency.

""Thanks to the harmonised legal requirements which we adopted today, our financial sector will be better able to continue to function at all times,"" Stanjura said.

The requirements will apply to financial firms and ""critical"" third parties supplying cloud based services.

""If a large-scale attack on the European financial sector is launched, we will be prepared for it,"" Stanjura said.

The bloc's securities, insurance and banking watchdogs will write technical rules to implement the new law.

The European Parliament, which had joint say, has already given the green light and the law will come into force around the end of 2024.

Britain, no longer in the EU, said in June its regulators will be given powers to designate which outsourced services can come under direct supervision of the Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority.

LAS VEGAS, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) on Tuesday announced software drawing on its retail expertise in an effort to boost sales to businesses and remain the largest cloud-computing provider ahead of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google.

Taking lessons learned over years of delivering online orders to shoppers' doorsteps, Amazon's cloud division unveiled a service called AWS Supply Chain to alert businesses when inventories are low and help them address supply issues that were chronic during the pandemic.

At its annual Las Vegas conference, the cloud unit also showed off AWS Clean Rooms, which allows businesses to tailor ads to customers while maintaining their privacy, among other applications. Amazon in recent years has developed its own major advertising business.

The services are part of Amazon's long-time strategy to develop functions for its e-commerce arm and then offer them to other companies. At the same time, Amazon's cloud has lost out on sales to brick-and-mortar retailers which are reluctant to hire a company that is also their e-commerce competitor.

Other new services it announced include Amazon Omics for genomic analysis and Amazon Security Lake, which helps businesses assemble data from cybersecurity vendors and other sources.

Powell says Fed could scale back rate hikes in December

Indexes end: S&P 500 +3.09%, Nasdaq +4.41%, Dow +2.18%















Nov 30 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply higher on Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank might scale back the pace of its interest rate hikes as soon as December.

The S&P 500 rallied and closed above its 200 day moving average for the first time since April after the release of Powell's remarks prepared for delivery at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington.

A potential trend change?

Powell also cautioned that the fight against inflation was far from over and that key questions remain unanswered, including how high rates will ultimately need to rise and for how long.

""(The market) has waited with bated breath, looking for that clarification in terms of duration and extent of Fed tightening. And anything that gives hope to the idea the Fed is becoming less hawkish is viewed as a positive for stocks, at least on a short-term basis,"" said Chuck Carlson, Chief Executive Officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.

Bets that the Fed will reduce the size of its rate hikes, as well as recent data pointing to a mild cooling in inflation, led the benchmark S&P 500 index (.SPX) to its second straight month of gains.

The CME FedWatch Tool showed futures traders seeing a 75% chance that the Fed will raise interest rates by 50 basis points at its December meeting, up from a 65% chance before Powell's comments were released. The FedWatch tool now shows a 25% chance of a 75 basis point increase.

Nvidia (NVDA.O) rallied more than 8%, Microsoft (MSFT.O) jumped 6.2% and Apple (AAPL.O) climbed 4.9%.

Tesla Inc's (TSLA.O) shares surged 7.7% after China Merchants Bank International said Tesla's sales in China in November were boosted by price cuts and incentives offered on its Model 3 and Model Y.

The Philadelphia Semiconductor index (.SOX) surged 5.85%, trimming its loss in 2022 to about 28%.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was heavy, with 15.0 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 11.1 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.

For November, the S&P 500 climbed 5.4%, the Dow added 5.7% and the Nasdaq increased 4.4%.

An ADP National Employment report showed private employment increased by 127,000 in November, below expectations of 200,000 jobs, suggesting demand for labor was cooling amid high interest rates.

""The ADP employment number not meeting expectations fits into the narrative that the Fed will have room and start slowing down its rate hikes, and that definitely benefits interest rate sensitive assets,"" said Keith Buchanan, a portfolio manager at Globalt in Atlanta.

The Labor Department's closely watched nonfarm payrolls data is due on Friday. A report showed U.S. job openings falling to 10.334 million in October, against 10.687 million in the prior month.

Another reading showed the U.S. economy rebounded more strongly than initially thought in the third quarter.

The S&P 500 remains down about 14% so far in 2022, while the Nasdaq index (.IXIC) has lost about 27%.

479,374,Microsoft,2022-11-30,Spotify CEO renews attack on Apple after Musk's salvo,"













STOCKHOLM, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Spotify's (SPOT.N) CEO Daniel Ek renewed his attack on Apple (AAPL.O) on Wednesday in a series of tweets alleging the iPhone maker ""gives itself every advantage while at the same time stifling innovation and hurting consumers"".

loading

Ek tagged a number of sympathetic business leaders in his 21-tweet thread, including Musk, Microsoft president Brad Smith, and Proton founder Andy Yen.

On Monday, the world's richest person Elon Musk criticized the fee Apple charges software developers - including his Twitter business - for in-app purchases, and posted a meme suggesting he was willing to ""go to war"" rather than pay it.

Spotify has previously submitted antitrust complaints against Apple in various countries, alleging the 30% charge has forced Spotify to ""artificially inflate"" its own prices.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. It has previously said the 30% cut it takes on purchases made in its App Store is used to protect consumers in areas such as fraud and privacy.

Tim Sweeney, the CEO of ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games, tweeted on Wednesday that fighting Apple's ""monopoly"" was ""an American issue transcending party politics"".

""So how much longer will we look away from this threat to the future of the internet? How many more consumers will be denied choice? There's been a lot of talk. Talk is helpful but we need action,"" Ek wrote.

Musk is expected to talk with European Commissioner Thierry Breton via videocall on Wednesday afternoon, though the agenda was unknown. The pair previously met in Texas in May, ahead of Musk's $44 billion purchase of Twitter, where they signaled broad agreement on EU tech regulation policy.

REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo















Dec 1 (Reuters) - Shares of Salesforce Inc (CRM.N) fell about 10% on Thursday after co-CEO Bret Taylor's sudden exit caught Wall Street off guard and raised concerns about the merit in having two leaders.

His departure after just a year in the role coincides with slowing revenue growth at the software company as it faces stiff competition from the likes of Microsoft (MSFT.O), a stronger dollar and businesses cutting spending amid red-hot inflation.

At least 17 brokerages slashed their price targets on the stock, with the steepest cut coming from J.P. Morgan analysts who lowered their target by $45 to $200.

Jefferies analysts said the surprise exit indicated that the ""co-CEO model is not working with two departures in three years.""

Taylor, a tech veteran who has worked at Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META.O) as technology chief and served as Twitter Inc's chairman, departs San Francisco-based Salesforce after six years, leaving co-founder Marc Benioff as top boss.

Benioff tapped Taylor as co-CEO in 2021, to replace Oracle (ORCL.N) executive Keith Block who stepped down from the role just before the pandemic began.

Taylor was involved with Salesforce's software which helps businesses effectively manage customer interaction, and was a key driving force behind the company's $27.7 billion takeover of workspace messaging platform Slack Technologies.

He was previously chief operating officer and chief product officer of the company.

""We view this leadership change as a significant blow given his leadership role on product,"" Needham analysts said in a note.

Shares of the company, which have lost about 37% so far this year, ended 5.7% higher on Wednesday before Salesforce's third-quarter earnings report.

481,636,Microsoft,2022-12-01,Exclusive: U.S. Chamber of Commerce warns against draft EU plan to exclude non-EU cloud vendors,"[1/3] A sign is pictured outside a Google office near the company's headquarters in Mountain View, California, U.S., May 8, 2019. REUTERS/Paresh Dave/File Photo















BRUSSELS, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 12 other groups on Thursday warned the European Union against adopting rules that could exclude Amazon (AMZN.O), Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Microsoft (MSFT.O) and other non-EU cloud services providers from the European market.

The Chamber, the National Foreign Trade Council, the Japan Association of New Economy, techUK, the Latin American Internet Association, the Computer & Communications Industry Association and others set out their concerns in a joint industry statement seen by Reuters.

The statement was sent to relevant Commissioners at the European Commission, national governments, EU cybersecurity agency ENISA, and EU lawmakers early Thursday.

At issue is a draft proposal from ENISA for an EU certification scheme vouching for the cybersecurity of cloud services that would determine how governments and companies in the bloc select a vendor for their business.

ENISA's draft dated May seen by Reuters sets out requirements for a certified cloud service provider (CSP) aimed at preventing and limiting interference from non-EU states with the operation of certified cloud services.

""The CSP's registered head office and global headquarters shall be established in a member state of the EU,"" the document said.

Cloud services would have to be operated and maintained from the EU, and all cloud service customer data stored and processed in the EU, with the bloc's laws taking precedence over non-EU laws including countries with extra-territorial measures.

The EU should refrain from adopting requirements of a political, rather than technical, nature, which would exclude legitimate cloud suppliers and would not enhance effective cybersecurity controls, the Chamber and the other groups said.

""These EUCS (EU draft) requirements are seemingly designed to ensure that non-EU suppliers cannot access the EU market on an equal footing, thereby preventing European industries and governments from fully benefiting from the offerings of these global suppliers,"" they said.

""If other countries were to pursue similar policies, European cloud providers could see their own opportunities in non-EU markets dwindle,"" they said.

The groups also questioned whether the scheme complies with the World Trade Organization's General Agreement on Trade in Services and the EU's Government Procurement Agreement commitments.

ENISA, which declined to comment on the draft document, said the voluntary scheme sets out three levels.

""The highest level is intended to only be applicable to a small set of use cases requiring the highest level of security (e.g. highly sensitive government and highly critical infrastructure applications), for which some level of independence from non-EU laws will have to be ensured. Not all cloud services,"" a spokesperson said.

""After consulting with the European Commission, ENISA is proposing two certification levels for assurance level 'high', in order to cater for the different needs identified in the European industry and member states,"" she said.

ENISA sent an updated proposal to the Commission for consultation in September, which could lead to changes before a final text is adopted.

""The discussions are ongoing to have a balanced approach and no decision has been taken yet. The scheme should be fully in line with EU law, as well as with the EU's international commitments, including on trade,"" a spokesperson for the EU executive said.

The size of the global government cloud market is expected to reach $71.2 billion by 2027 from $27.6 billion in 2021, according to market research firm Imarc Group. Cloud computing has become a major driver of growth for Big Tech in recent years.

482,736,Microsoft,2022-12-01,Musk set to finally take wraps off Tesla truck - to tough crowd,"













SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O) is set to unveil on Thursday its long-delayed Semi, a 18-wheeler heavy duty vehicle that has faced skepticism from industry experts who doubt battery electric trucks can take the strain of hauling hefty loads for hundreds of miles.

The launch marks the electric carmaker's first foray into the trucking business as U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is set to offer a generous $40,000 tax credit for clean commercial vehicles.

At the unveiling event in Tesla's battery factory in Nevada, analysts will look for details such as pricing, how much freight the Semi can carry, and its charging speed.

Chief Executive Elon Musk initially said the trucks would be in production by 2019, but that was delayed due to battery constraints. In 2017, Tesla said the 500 mile (805 kilometre) range Semi to be priced at $180,000.

The billionaire, who now runs five companies after buying Twitter, has a record of overpromising on Tesla's products.

Musk had promised, for instance, that Tesla's mass-market electric sedan Model 3 would be priced at $35,000, a claim that bombed. The base model now sells at $47,000.

He also previously said it was highly likely that the Semi would be the first Tesla vehicle to have self-driving capability. But in October Musk said Tesla vehicles were not ready to take humans out of the loop.

Robyn Denholm, chair of Tesla, recently said the automaker might make 100 Semis this year. Musk announced the start of production of the truck in early October, and said food and drink giant PepsiCo (PEP.O) would get the first deliveries on Dec. 1.

TOUGH SELL

Some analysts believe it will be harder for the automaker to penetrate the commercial truck market than the mass car trade.

""Tesla is very much the new kid on the block here. It has everything to prove, and it will be proving it against very, very strong legacy competitors,"" said Oliver Dixon, senior analyst at Guidehouse.

Musk has touted the Semi's 500 mile range, far higher than that of electric trucks offered by rivals Daimler (MBGn.DE), Volvo (VOLVb.ST), startup Nikola (NKLA.O) and Renault Trucks (RENA.PA).

""Tesla team just completed a 500 mile drive with a Tesla Semi weighing in at 81,000 lbs!"" Musk tweeted last week. For Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who has expressed skepticism about all-electric trucks, Musk said: ""(Gates) can drive it himself if he wants!"".

loading

Nikola said last month it was slowing deliveries of its electric Tre BEV trucks to slash battery costs that have soared by $110,000 per truck.

""I'm worried not about other competitors,"" Nikola boss Michael Loscheller told Reuters on Wednesday. ""I want to take diesel trucks off the road,"" he said, adding that federal incentives for trucks that run on hydrogen could be more substantial than those battery electric trucks.

CHARGING CHALLENGE

Musk has said Tesla needs to mass-produce its cheaper 4680 batteries in-house to build the Semi, which uses five times the number of cells a car needs. But he recently said the Semi will use the traditional 2170 batteries that Tesla gets from suppliers.

""A lot of us are kind of skeptical, because no one else has been able to prove that they can do it,"" said Mike Roeth, executive director of the North American Council for Freight Efficiency who attended Tesla's first prototype Semi presentation in 2017.

At the 2017 event, Musk said the truck could get to 400 miles on a 30-minute charge at solar-powered ""mega chargers"" without providing details. Finding the power to charge electric vehicles remains a major challenge.

""The whole reason for a truck is to haul around 40,000 to 45,000 pounds of freight,"" said Roeth, a former executive at U.S. truck maker Navistar. ""And if your batteries weigh too much, or they cost too much ... that doesn't work.""

483,577,Microsoft,2022-12-02,"Jennifer Garner, John Legend attend lavish U.S. state dinner for France's Macron","













WASHINGTON, Dec 1 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden rolled out the red carpet on Thursday for celebrities, lawmakers, and titans of industry at the White House's first state dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron.

The dinner is the crowning social event of a trip aimed at showing Biden's commitment to Washington's oldest ally even as the two countries wrangle over how to handle Russia's war in Ukraine, subsidies for U.S. products and other issues.

The guest list included actress Jennifer Garner and her daughter with Ben Affleck, Violet; singer John Legend and model Chrissy Teigen; ""Vogue"" editor Anna Wintour; and director Baz Luhrmann.

Those celebrities joined members of Biden's Cabinet, lawmakers, and business leaders including Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) CEO Brian Moynihan, KKR & Co Inc (KKR.N) investor Henry Kravis and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) president Brad Smith.

On Thursday night, Biden and his wife, Jill, welcomed the Macrons back to the White House for the dinner after diplomatic meetings earlier in the day.

Both presidents wore tuxedos. Jill wore an Oscar de la Renta lace dress and dangly silver earrings. Macron's wife, Brigitte, was clad in Louis Vuitton.

Less than two weeks after Biden's granddaughter was married on White House grounds, the event brought a touch of pizzazz to the businesslike presidential residence, whose social calendar was undermined by precautions taken in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Guests strutted along the red carpet in front of reporters to a reception in the White House before taking a trolley bus to a pavilion on the South Lawn for the formal dinner around 10 p.m.

There they were treated to toasts, music from Jon Batiste, Chardonnay from the Napa Valley and cheeses from Oregon, California and Wisconsin. Some 200 Maine lobsters were flown in for the candle-lit occasion.

""It's going to be fire,"" Batiste told reporters of his performance as he arrived.

The lavish Washington dinner is one of few events that bring together people including the president's son Hunter and Kevin McCarthy, who leads a Republican congressional delegation that has vowed to investigate his business dealings.

Macron arrived in Washington on Tuesday for his second state visit to the United States since the French leader took office in 2017.

Biden, 80, and Macron, 44, have had many meetings at international gatherings but this was the longest time they have spent together.

""Tonight we celebrate the enduring alliance between France and the United States,"" Biden said as guests clinked their champagne flutes. ""Vive la France and God bless America.""

Macron added that the two countries come from ""the same values"" of ""we, the people.""

484,487,Microsoft,2022-12-02,Activision Blizzard game testers vote to form union,"[1/2] The entrance to the Activision Blizzard Inc. campus is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., August 6, 2019. REUTERS/Mike Blake















Dec 2 (Reuters) - Workers who test games at Activision Blizzard Inc.'s (ATVI.O) unit Blizzard Albany have voted to form a union months after the games developer began negotiating with employees at its Wisconsin unit, the first in the company to unionize.

The workers based near Albany, New York, voted 14-0 to join the Communication Workers of America union, the National Labor Relations Board said on Friday.

Blizzard Albany has developed installments of popular video game franchises including Guitar Hero, Call of Duty, and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.

Activision had argued that Blizzard Albany's entire workforce of about 100 employees, including production workers, should have been involved in the union vote and not only game testers.

The NLRB rejected those claims earlier this week, saying game testers could form their own bargaining unit because they perform a distinct role and have separate supervision and significantly lower wages than other employees.

CWA Secretary-Treasurer Sara Steffens said in a statement that the union's victory could open the door for unionization at other game developers.

An Activision spokesperson said the company is considering its options ""with a focus on what is best for all employees and to provide the best games for our millions of players.""

""We still believe our entire Albany team should have the right to vote,"" the spokesperson said.

The company has until next week to object to the election results. If it does not, Activision is legally required to begin bargaining with the union.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) earlier this year said it would pay $69 billion to acquire Activision, though the deal is facing antitrust scrutiny from U.S. and European regulators.

The vote announced on Friday came after about two dozen employees of Activision unit Raven Software voted to unionize in May. Activision recognized the union and began negotiations in June.

The NLRB has accused Activision of violating federal labor law by threatening retaliation against workers who use social media to discuss working conditions. Activision has denied wrongdoing in the case, which is pending.

485,283,Microsoft,2022-12-02,Judges skeptical that biometric privacy case belongs in arbitration,"Summary

Summary Law firms

Law firms Related documents Appeals court concerned about applying arbitration pacts to third parties

Screening company cited rental car app's contract with customers

Critical issue for companies sued under unique Illinois law















(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday seemed likely to rule that a rental car service's arbitration agreements with its customers did not shield a third-party company that verifies the identities of the service's users from facing class action biometric privacy claims in court.

A three-judge 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel in Chicago heard oral arguments in an appeal by the company, Mitek Systems Inc, of a judge's ruling that said it could not invoke the arbitration agreements because it was not a beneficiary of contracts between HyreCar and its customers.

The question is critical because many screening companies face multimillion-dollar class action lawsuits under a unique Illinois law that regulates the collection and storage of biometric information. Pushing cases into individual arbitration can be quicker and cheaper then fighting them in court.

HyreCar, which allows car owners to rent vehicles to drivers for services such as Uber, contracts with California-based Mitek to verify users' identities by scanning their driver's license photos with facial recognition software.

A HyreCar customer, Joshua Johnson, claims Mitek violated Illinois' Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) by collecting and storing drivers' biometric data without providing notice or obtaining consent. HyreCar is not involved in the case.

Mitek claims it is covered by HyreCar's arbitration agreement with its customers because it expressly applies to ""all beneficiaries"" of the company's contracts.

All three 7th Circuit judges on Friday said they were concerned that applying the arbitration agreement to Mitek would open the door to shielding any third-party company from legal claims despite it not being a party to an agreement.

Circuit Judge Frank Easterbrook pressed Stephanie Schuster, a lawyer for Mitek, on whether the agreement would apply to OfficeMax if it sold paper to HyreCar, or to Amazon Web Services because it hosts the HyreCar app.

""OfficeMax is paid by using money raised from selling the services, which is exactly how Mitek is paid,"" he said.

Schuster, of Morgan Lewis & Bockius, maintained that unlike paper or web-hosting services, the screening conducted by Mitek is a central part of the service offered by HyreCar. But Easterbrook sounded unconvinced.

""Your answer to me is, 'yes, Mitek is a beneficiary but nobody else is,'"" the judge said. ""That doesn't sound very likely.""

The 7th Circuit panel includes Circuit Judges Michael Scudder and John Lee, who echoed Easterbrook's comments while asking few questions of Johnson's lawyer, Timothy Kingsbury.

BIPA is the only state law that allows consumers and employees to sue businesses over their handling of biometric data, including photographs, retinal scans and fingerprints. The number of lawsuits alleging BIPA violations has exploded in recent years in the wake of court rulings making it easier to win them.

Many companies have been sued under the law, including Amazon.com, Microsoft and Facebook, which in 2020 agreed to pay $650 million to settle claims that it violated BIPA by storing users' facial geometry for a feature that automatically recognized people in photographs.

In the first BIPA case to go to trial, a Chicago federal jury in October ordered BNSF Railway Co to pay $228 million to 45,000 truck drivers after finding the company collected the drivers' fingerprints without consent.

The case is Johnson v. Mitek Systems Inc, 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 22-1830.

Dec 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said on Friday the Cyber Safety Review Board will investigate recent cyber-attacks linked to Lapsus$.

""Lapsus$ has reportedly employed techniques to bypass a range of commonly-used security controls and has successfully infiltrated a number of companies across industries and geographic areas,"" the DHS said.

The hacker group, known to have several members globally, was most recently involved in a digital intrusion at ride-hailing company Uber Inc (UBER.N).

It is also known to have infiltrated systems at Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Okta Inc (OKTA.O), an authentication service.

The Cyber Safety Review Board is a public-private body that takes up fact-finding initiatives. It serves to review major cyber events and make concrete recommendations.

487,38,Microsoft,2022-12-05,Union says Microsoft will recognize unit of videogame testers,"













Dec 5 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) will voluntarily recognize a union of about 300 videogame testers at subsidiary ZeniMax Studios if they vote to unionize, a first for the company in the United States, the Communication Workers of America union (CWA) said on Monday.

ZeniMax employees at four locations in Maryland and Texas began voting through an online platform on Friday. The company owns major game franchises including The Elder Scrolls and Fallout.

Voluntarily agreeing to bargain with the union would allow Microsoft to avoid a formal election overseen by the U.S. National Labor Relations Board and the legal battles that often ensue.

CWA President Christopher Shelton applauded Microsoft's move in a statement, saying ""when workers have the opportunity to join a union without company interference, it empowers them to have their voices heard in the workplace.""

Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The company in June entered into an agreement with the CWA to remain neutral in union organizing campaigns at Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O), which Microsoft is seeking to purchase for $69 billion. The proposed acquisition is facing antitrust scrutiny from U.S. and European regulators.

Game testers at Activision units Blizzard Albany and Raven Software have voted this year to join unions amid claims by the CWA that the company has threatened and retaliated against union supporters. Activision has denied wrongdoing.

488,92,Microsoft,2022-12-05,Microsoft offers Sony 10-year contract for 'Call of Duty' releases on PlayStation - WSJ,"













Dec 5 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) has offered Sony (6758.T) a 10-year contract to make each new ""Call of Duty"" release available on PlayStation the same day it comes to Xbox, according to an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal on Monday from a Microsoft executive.

Sony's gaming chief Jim Ryan said in September that Microsoft's earlier offer to keep the popular game series made by Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) on PlayStation for three years after the current agreement expires was inadequate.

Xbox maker Microsoft's latest offer to Sony comes as it faces increased regulatory scrutiny over its $69 billion buyout deal for Activision Blizzard.

The offer, made in January, has attracted regulatory headwinds in the European Union, Britain and in the United States, with Sony criticizing the deal and even calling for a regulatory veto.

Reuters reported last month that Microsoft's remedy would consist mainly of a 10-year licensing deal to Playstation owner Sony.

""The main supposed potential anticompetitive risk Sony raises is that Microsoft would stop making 'Call of Duty' available on the PlayStation. But that would be economically irrational,"" Microsoft President Brad Smith said in the WSJ opinion piece.

Microsoft also said on Monday it was raising the prices of new Xbox games to $70 from $60 starting in 2023, according to a company spokesperson.

Summary

Summary Companies Global recession talk rattles investors

Dollar gains against euro, yen, sterling

Treasury yields slip on slower Fed rate hike hopes

Oil prices slump on economic jitters















NEW YORK/LONDON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Global stocks posted a third straight day of losses and the dollar rose on Tuesday as the market weighed how long the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates high and ""restrictive"" to the U.S. economy.

Stocks on Wall Street fell, with all sectors in the red with the exception of utilities (.SPLRCU). The major bourses in Europe also declined as concerns mounted about a global slowdown before a raft of major central bank rate decisions next week.

MSCI's all-country world index (.MIWD00000PUS), a gauge of stock performance in 47 countries, fell 1.26% to mark its third down day in a row after hitting a three-month high last week.

The dollar gained against the euro, yen, British pound and Canadian dollar, among other major currencies.

Treasury yields fell, but more at the long end of maturities than the short end, which deepened the inverted yield curve, a market indicator of a looming recession. The gap between yields on two- and 10-year notes was -83.7 basis points.

The market needs to recognize that a recession most likely is a reality, not just a hypothetical scenario, and that valuations need to go lower, said Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede in Philadelphia.

""During recessions, markets on average price at a discount to fair value, which they have not yet done,"" Pride said. ""There is not a single instance in which a market has bottomed before the recession started.""

Data released on Monday showing U.S. services industry activity unexpectedly picked up in November and last week's robust U.S. payrolls report have raised doubts about how soon the Fed might ease monetary policy. The Fed aims to slow growth by reducing credit and money available for banks to lend.

Futures show the market expects the Fed's peak terminal rate to rise to 4.974% next May, but by December 2023 to have fallen to 4.534% on speculation the Fed will cut rates to help the economy rebound from an expected slowdown.

""We believe we hit the lows already and it's not going to be a straight line up, but a choppy road ahead,"" said King Lip, chief investment strategist at BakerAvenue Wealth Management in San Francisco.

""We're in the minority in terms of our forecast because a lot of the colleagues we've been speaking to are much more pessimistic,"" he said.

Among the biggest drags on the benchmark S&P 500 index was Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) after European Union regulators ruled its Facebook and Instagram units should not require users to agree to personalized ads based on their digital activity.

Wall Street also was led lower by other megacap stocks, including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 1.03%, the S&P 500 (.SPX) slid 1.44% and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 2%. In Europe, the STOXX 600 index (.STOXX) closed down 0.58%.

The dollar rose as investors waited for next week's expected 50 basis points rate hike by the Fed.

The euro fell 0.24% to $1.0466, while the yen weakened 0.21% at 137.03 per dollar.

Euro zone government bond yields fell after two European Central Bank officials signaled inflation and rates may be close to peaking in the run-up to a raft of major central bank decisions.

The ECB, the Bank of England and the Fed all meet next week to discuss monetary policy. The Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday offered a glimpse of decisions to come after raising interest rates to decade highs and sticking with a prediction of more hikes ahead.

Reuters Graphics

All eyes will be on the release next Tuesday of November's U.S. consumer price index data, which will provide insight into the pace of inflation.

The yield on U.S. 10-year notes fell 6.6 basis points to 3.533%.

Oil prices fell in a volatile market as the dollar stayed strong and economic uncertainty offset the bullish impact of a price cap placed on Russian oil and the prospects of a demand boost in China.

On Monday, crude futures recorded their biggest daily drop in two weeks.

U.S. crude futures fell $2.68 to settle at $74.25 a barrel, while Brent settled down $3.33 at $79.35.

U.S. gold futures settled up 0.1% at $1,782.40 an ounce.

Dec 6 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) recently considered building a ""super app"" that could include shopping, messaging, news and web search services among others, The Information reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The Windows-maker mulled building the app to loosen the hold of Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on the mobile search space, according to the report.

Microsoft executives wanted the app to also boost the company's multibillion-dollar advertising business and Bing search, as well as draw more users to Teams messaging and other mobile services, The Information reported

Microsoft did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

A super app, made popular in Asia by Tencent Holdings' (0700.HK) WeChat and South east Asia's Grab Holdings (GRAB.O), has been described as the Swiss army knife of mobile apps, offering a suite of services for users such as messaging, social networking, peer-to-peer payments and e-commerce shopping.

Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk, who also owns Twitter, has shown interest in building a super app named ""X"" that would combine a multitude of services.

The report added that it isn't clear whether the company would launch such an app, but Chief Executive Satya Nadella has pushed for the Bing search service to perform better with the Teams and Outlook.

491,74,Microsoft,2022-12-07,"Microsoft to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo, Sony on the spot","













TOKYO, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) has entered into a 10-year commitment to bring the gaming title ""Call of Duty"" to Nintendo (7974.T) platforms, the chief executive officer of Microsoft Gaming, Phil Spencer, said in a post on Twitter on Wednesday.

The popular first-person shooter series from Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) has been released for some of Nintendo's past consoles, but not for its current-generation hardware Switch, the Kyoto-based company said.

The announcement comes after Microsoft's planned $69 billion acquisition of the ""Call of Duty"" maker raised concern among regulators that the deal could stifle competition, with rival Sony Group Corp (6758.T) criticising the deal and even calling for a regulatory veto.

Microsoft President Brad Smith tweeted: ""our acquisition will bring Call of Duty to more gamers and more platforms than ever before ... Any day @Sony wants to sit down and talk, we'll be happy to hammer out a 10-year deal for PlayStation as well""

Earlier this year, Sony's gaming chief Jim Ryan called an offer by Microsoft to keep the ""Call of Duty"" series on PlayStation for three years after the current agreement ""inadequate"".

""I think this is an attempt by Microsoft to pressure Sony into signing a deal with Activision and to make it easier for Microsoft to finish and close the deal with Activision,"" said Serkan Toto, founder of the Kantan Games consultancy.

""It's basically good PR for Microsoft.""

Sony officials were not immediately available for comment.

Microsoft competes with Sony and Nintendo in the global video game industry, which saw strong growth in recent years with people spending more time at home because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Shares in Nintendo closed up 0.3% after the Microsoft announcement, outperforming the Nikkei average's (.N225) 0.7% slide and Sony's 1.3% fall.

(This story has been officially corrected after Nintendo clarified to say ""Call of Duty"" series has been released for some of its past consoles, but not for Switch, in paragraph two)

492,700,Microsoft,2022-12-07,Why a recession in 2023 could see remote workers return to the office,"













Dec 7 (Reuters) - Employers have been asking workers with increasing urgency this year to return to the office, while workers are demanding flexibility, creating a tussle that is yet to be resolved as 2022 draws to a close.

Hybrid arrangements, where workers go into the office part of the week, have gained broad acceptance as a compromise. But many workers are holding out, even as some companies demand full-time return.

In New York City, for example, state government data shows subway use increased in wealthier and business districts, especially since this summer, indicating more white-collar workers were going to the office. Still, it had only reached about 67% of pre-pandemic levels in October. In recent months, subway use on the weekends has reached closer to pre-pandemic levels than on weekdays. In London, separate data shows tube journeys had reached just over 80% of pre-pandemic levels.

The evolving workplace is reshaping businesses that serve office workers. Globally, office real estate is moving toward shorter leases and flexible working setups, according to a JPMorgan Chase report in September. In cities such as London and New York, companies are downsizing but also moving up: demand for prime real estate has grown, while older buildings are likely to suffer.

The landscape for other businesses that served office workers has changed, too. In New York, while more new businesses have opened over the past year than were lost during the pandemic, their geographical distribution has changed, said Kathryn Wylde, chief executive of the Partnership for New York City. Manhattan, where the bulk of offices are, lost businesses, while boroughs like Queens and Brooklyn, where a lot of people live, gained them.

WHY IT MATTERS?

Much is at stake over how the workplace evolves. It could determine whether some people who left the workforce during the pandemic – such as women who served as primary unpaid caregivers, older workers and those suffering from long COVID – return. That, in turn, could impact labor shortages afflicting many economies and sectors.

For employers, the model they choose would determine their attractiveness to workers, especially the younger generations who demand more flexibility and better work-life balance.

While companies could save on real estate, hybrid work could come with other costs -- from worries about lost productivity and collaboration to mentoring and the organization’s culture. In regulated sectors such as finance, remote settings could also be detrimental to compliance.

The nature of the workplace could also exacerbate inequalities that were exposed by the pandemic: racial and ethnic minorities were over-represented in frontline tasks where remote working was not possible and faced a higher health risk. Not much has changed for them.

WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR 2023?

White-collar workers are working hard. A Microsoft report in September said the number of meetings per week had increased 153% globally for the average Teams user since the start of the pandemic – and 42% of workers multi-tasked during those meetings. Still, 85% of the leaders it surveyed felt they did not have confidence employees were being productive in a hybrid workplace.

The coming year could determine who ends up having the upper hand in determining what work looks like in the future. A booming economy and labor shortages have given workers more say; a recession might take some of that away.

“It's not going to be so easy to give up your job,” Wylde said. ""That will probably mean that people are less resistant to the requirement they are back in the office at least three days a week -- which is where it feels like it is headed.”

493,117,Microsoft,2022-12-07,"Pentagon splits $9 billion cloud contract among Google, Amazon, Oracle and Microsoft","













Dec 7 (Reuters) - The Pentagon awarded $9 billion worth of cloud computing contracts to Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O), Amazon Web Services Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Oracle Corp <ORCL.N> on Wednesday.

The Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) is the multi-cloud successor to the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI), which was an IT modernization project to build a large, common commercial cloud for the Department of Defense.

The separate contracts, which carry a notional top line of $9 billion, run until 2028 and will provide the Department of Defense with enterprise-wide, globally available cloud services across all security domains and classification levels, the contract announcement said.

U.S. Navy Commander Jessica McNulty, a Department of Defense spokesperson, said in a statement the JWCC was a multiple-award procurement composed of four contracts with a shared ceiling of $9 billion.

The move comes months after the Pentagon had delayed its decision to award an enterprise-wide JWCC contract.

The Pentagon attempted to move to the cloud several years ago using the JEDI concept, but the proposal died after litigation stopped the procurement process.

This deal could put the military more in line with private-sector companies, many of whom split up their cloud computing work among multiple vendors.

495,475,Microsoft,2022-12-08,"Stolen data of 600,000 Indians sold on bot markets so far - study","













BENGALURU, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Around five million people globally have had their data stolen and sold on the bot market till date, of which 600,000 are from India, making it the worst affected country, according to one of the world's largest VPN serice providers NordVPN.

Bot markets are used by hackers to sell stolen data from victims' devices with bot malware.

The study by NordVPN, of Lithuania's Nord Security, said the stolen data included user logins, cookies, digital fingerprints, screenshots and other information, with the average price for the digital identity of a person pegged at 490 Indian rupees($5.95).

NordVPN tracked data for the past four years, ever since bot markets were launched in 2018.

India has been dealing with cyber security concerns for a while. As recently as last month, multiple servers of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), a federal government hospital that caters to ministers, politicians and the general public, were infected on Nov. 23, a senior police official told Reuters.

A week after the ransomware attack on AIIMS, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) faced around 6,000 hacking attempts within 24 hours on Nov. 30, Times of India reported.

Indian cybersecurity rules have tightened only earlier this year, with the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) requiring tech companies to report data breaches within six hours of noticing such incidents and to maintain IT and communications logs for six months. read more

NordVPN's study looked into three major bot markets - the Genesis market, the Russian Market, and 2Easy - and found stolen logins including those from Google, Microsoft and Facebook accounts.

""What makes bot markets different from other dark web markets is that they are able to get large amounts of data about one person in one place,"" said Marijus Briedis, chief technology officer at NordVPN.

""And after the bot is sold, they guarantee the buyer that the victim's information will be updated as long as their device is infected by the bot.""

Researchers of NordVPN found 667 million cookies, 81,000 digital fingerprints, 538,000 auto-fill forms, numerous device screenshots, and webcam snaps in their study.

496,66,Microsoft,2022-12-08,Microsoft gaming ambitions hobbled as U.S. seeks to block Activision deal,"













WASHINGTON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - The Biden administration on Thursday moved to block Microsoft's (MSFT.O) $69 billion bid to buy ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard , throwing a stumbling block in front of the tech giant's plans to rapidly expand its portfolio of popular games and catch up to bigger rivals.

Microsoft, which owns the Xbox console and game network platform, said in January 2022 that it would buy Activision for $68.7 billion in the biggest gaming industry deal in history.

Without Activision and its variety of games across mobile, consoles and PCs, Microsoft could struggle to attract users to its budding subscription service for accessing games. Drawing subscribers has become a priority for big tech companies as traditional growth sources such as ad sales become less reliable.

The U.S. software company had said it wanted the deal to help it compete with gaming leaders Tencent (0700.HK) and PlayStation owner Sony (6758.T), which has criticized the deal.

But, in its complaint, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which enforces antitrust law, said that Microsoft had a record of hoarding valuable gaming content.

""Microsoft has already shown that it can and will withhold content from its gaming rivals,"" said Holly Vedova, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition

. ""Today, we seek to stop Microsoft from gaining control over a leading independent game studio and using it to harm competition in multiple dynamic and fast-growing gaming markets.""

The agency set a hearing before an administrative law judge for August 2023.

Microsoft President Brad Smith said the company would fight the FTC. ""While we believed in giving peace a chance, we have complete confidence in our case and welcome the opportunity to present our case in court,"" he said.

The Biden administration has taken a more aggressive approach to antitrust enforcement. The U.S. Department of Justice recently stopped a $2.2 billion merger of Penguin Random House, the world's largest book publisher, and smaller U.S. rival Simon & Schuster.

""This is more evidence of the administration's and the antitrust agencies' war against big tech,"" said Andre Barlow of the law firm Doyle, Barlow and Mazard PLLC. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have prioritized big tech in antitrust enforcement.

Shares in Activision closed down 1.5% at $74.76, while Microsoft slipped from earlier highs but closed about 1% higher at $247.40.

Activision, which has long dreamt of being a Disney-like entertainment conglomerate, also realized it needed more tech know-how and it could be forced to trim back its roster of games to shift resources into emerging areas such as AI.

COMPETITION CONCERNS

The FTC said that its concern was that Activision's popular games, including ""World of Warcraft"" and ""Diablo,"" would not continue to be offered on a range of consoles, PCs and mobile devices.

While Microsoft has suggested concessions to address competition concerns, the rapid pace of change in the tech and gaming industries could make those conditions useless over time.

To woo regulators, shortly after the deal was announced Microsoft unveiled a new set of principles for its app store, including open access to developers who meet privacy and security standards.

This month, in another move to blunt criticism, Microsoft entered into a 10-year commitment to offer ""Call of Duty,"" the popular first-person shooter series, to Nintendo (7974.T) platforms. Microsoft made the same offer to Sony.

Antitrust challenges have stumbled when companies put forward a ""fix"" for antitrust harms being done by a deal, said William Kovacic, a former FTC chair who now teaches law.

""I think we can predict with a high degree of certainty that he (the judge) will listen to those arguments (from Microsoft) and may be sympathetic to it,"" said Kovacic.

Chair Lina Khan and the two Democrats on the commission voted to approve the complaint, while Commissioner Christine Wilson, a Republican, voted no.

Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick told employees on Thursday that he was confident that the deal would go forward.

""The allegation that this deal is anti-competitive doesn't align with the facts, and we believe we’ll win this challenge,"" he told employees, saying that he believed the companies' arguments would win ""despite a regulatory environment focused on ideology and misconceptions about the tech industry.""

The deal also faces regulatory headwinds in Europe.

As of late November, Microsoft was expected to offer remedies to EU antitrust regulators in the coming weeks to stave off formal objections to the deal, people familiar with the matter said. The deadline for the European Commission to set out a formal list of competition concerns, known as a statement of objection, is in January.

497,752,Microsoft,2022-12-08,"S&P 500, Nasdaq snap losing streaks after jobless claims rise","Summary

Summary Companies Weekly jobless claims rise in line with estimates

Moderna, Pfizer up as FDA authorizes updated COVID boosters

Exxon climbs after boosting buyback program

Indexes up: Dow 0.55%, S&P 0.75%, Nasdaq 1.13%















Dec 8 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 (.SPX) ended higher on Thursday, snapping a five-session losing streak, as investors interpreted data showing a rise in weekly jobless claims as a sign the pace of interest rate hikes could soon slow.

Wall Street's main indexes had come under pressure in recent days, with the S&P 500 shedding 3.6% since the beginning of December on expectations of a longer rate-hike cycle and downbeat economic views from some top company executives.

Such thinking had also weighed on the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC), which had posted four straight losing sessions prior to Thursday's advance on the tech-heavy index.

Stocks rose as investors cheered data showing the number of Americans filing claims for jobless benefits increased moderately last week, while unemployment rolls hit a 10-month high toward the end of November.

The report follows data last Friday that showed U.S. employers hired more workers than expected in November and increased wages, spurring fears that the Fed might stick to its aggressive stance to tame decades-high inflation.

Markets have been swayed by data releases in recent days, with investors lacking certainty ahead of Federal Reserve guidance next week on interest rates.

Such behavior means Friday's producer price index and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey will likely dictate whether Wall Street can build on Thursday's rally.

""The market has to adjust to the fact that we're moving from a stimulus-based economy - both fiscal and monetary - into a fundamentals-based economy, and that's what we're grappling with right now,"" said Wiley Angell, chief market strategist at Ziegler Capital Management.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 183.56 points, or 0.55%, to close at 33,781.48; the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 29.59 points, or 0.75%, to finish at 3,963.51; and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 123.45 points, or 1.13%, at 11,082.00.

Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, led by a 1.6% gain in technology stocks (.SPLRCT).

Most mega-cap technology and growth stocks gained. Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) rose between 1.2% and 6.5%.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) ended 1.2% higher, despite giving up some intraday gains after the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint aimed at blocking the tech giant's $69 billion bid to buy Activision Blizzard Inc . The ""Call of Duty"" games maker closed 1.5% lower.

The energy index (.SPNY) was an exception, slipping 0.5%, despite Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) gaining 0.7% after announcing it would expand its $30-billion share repurchase program. The sector had been under pressure in recent sessions as commodity prices slipped: U.S. crude is now hovering near its level at the start of 2022.

Meanwhile, Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) advanced 3.2% after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized COVID-19 shots from the vaccine maker that target both the original coronavirus and Omicron sub-variants for use in children as young as six months old.

The regulator also approved similar guidance for fellow COVID vaccine maker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), which rose 3.1%, and its partner BioNTech, whose U.S.-listed shares gained 5.6%.

Rent the Runway Inc (RENT.O) posted its biggest ever one-day gain, jumping 74.3%, after the clothing rental firm raised its 2022 revenue forecast.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.07 billion shares, compared with the 10.90 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

The S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 232 new lows.

498,825,Microsoft,2022-12-08,A little breathing room — California privacy agency modifies proposed regulations,"Law firms Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders LLP Follow















December 8, 2022 - Within the last few months, the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA or the Agency) has twice modified the text of the proposed regulations implementing the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) (once on Oct. 18, and again on Nov. 3). This modification kicked off a 15-day comment period, which ended on Nov. 21, 2022.

Given that the CPRA takes effect on Jan. 1, 2023, businesses are eager to receive finalized rules to assist with their implementation efforts. The soonest businesses are likely to receive these rules, however, is not until the end of January or February 2023, given the Office of Administrative Law's (OAL) 30-day review period. Regardless, businesses should continue to make good faith efforts to comply with the law and be prepared to review their implementation efforts once the regulations are finalized.

For a full overview of the changes made during this latest round of edits, businesses can view the chart made available by the CPPA. For now, we have highlighted the top three changes that may give businesses some breathing room as we head into 2023.

1. Adding structure to the definition of unstructured data

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and now the CPRA, regulate ""personal information."" Personal information is broadly defined as any information that could reasonably be linked with a particular consumer or household. In regulating personal information, the CCPA/CPRA gives California residents certain rights over their personal information, including the right to access, delete, and correct their personal information and the right to limit certain types of processing activities (e.g., opting out of the ""selling"" or ""sharing"" of their personal information).

Once the CCPA was signed into law, many businesses started their privacy compliance journeys with a data mapping exercise. A data mapping exercise helps companies understand their information practices by identifying, among other things, what information the business collects, where it is sourced from, how it is used, and whether it is disclosed to any third parties.

One issue that businesses need help with when it comes to data mapping (and privacy compliance in general) is how to address unstructured data.

What is unstructured data? Unstructured data can generally be thought of as data that is not stored in an organized fashion (e.g., information stored in email accounts or chat systems). Structured data, in contrast, is stored in a predefined format (e.g., in a field-based format). Privacy professionals know applying laws such as the CCPA/CPRA to unstructured data is problematic. The concern, of course, is locating that information in the first place and then creating an automatic process to fold that data into the privacy program.

Enter the CPRA proposed regulations. The initial draft of the CPRA regulations introduced the concept of ""unstructured data,"" which was a relief in and of itself. By acknowledging that unstructured data exists, the draft regulations recognize the challenges privacy professionals face concerning that type of data set. The definition of ""unstructured"" in the initial draft of the proposed regulations, however, evoked uncertainty. There, the term ""unstructured,"" as it relates to personal information, was defined only as ""personal information that is not organized in a pre-defined manner, such as text, video files, and audio files.""

Furthermore, the term ""unstructured"" only appeared in connection with the ""Right to Correct,"" where businesses were allowed to consider whether contested personal information was stored in an unstructured manner, possibly suggesting that unstructured data may not need to be corrected in response to a consumer's request to correct.

The modified proposed regulations changed the definition of ""unstructured"" by removing the examples (text, video files, and audio files), and instead adding that unstructured data is that which cannot be retrieved or organized in a pre-defined manner without ""disproportionate effort"" on behalf of the business, service provider, contractor, or third party. ""Disproportionate effort"" is a term that appears throughout the proposed regulations, thus suggesting that the issues businesses face with respect to unstructured data go well beyond the Right to Correct.

The CCPA has not yet defined what constitutes ""disproportionate effort."" But the modified proposed regulations do describe disproportionate effort as instances when ""the time and/or resources expended ... to respond to the individualized request significantly outweighs the reasonably foreseeable impact to the consumer by not responding, taking into account applicable circumstances such as, the size of the business, service provider, contractor, or third party, the nature of the request, and the technical limitations impacting their ability to respond.""

Technical limitations could very well include issues such as data not being in a searchable or readily accessible format, which is the case for many types of unstructured data.

Of course, what constitutes disproportionate effort in one context may not constitute disproportionate effort in another. For example, in response to a ""Request to Know,"" a business may have to scour unstructured data for personal information. This can be challenging, time-consuming, and overwhelming because unstructured data can be in email accounts, chat software (e.g., Microsoft Teams), freeform fields in software, customer service ticketing systems, etc.

While the disproportionate effort provision does not allow businesses to ignore consumer requests, it may provide them with a reprieve from having to undergo a time-consuming search for personal information in response.

2. Simplyfying implementation efforts

The modified proposed regulations made several changes intended to simplify implementation. These changes include:

A. Modifications to the Notice at Collection: The modified proposed regulations no longer will require a business to identify in its Notice at Collection the names of the third parties that control the collection of personal information. What does this mean? Potentially, a lightening of the recent infusion of specificity around ad tech vendors for U.S.-only companies. Nevertheless, this type of disclosure may still be required in some jurisdictions outside the United States.

B. Information stored on archived backups: The modified proposed regulations help businesses by allowing them, service providers, and contractors to delay compliance with requests to correct for information stored on archived backup systems.

C. Data correction: Because of the modified proposed regulations, businesses will no longer be required to make a consumer's written statement (about the accuracy of their personal information being contested by the consumer) available to any person to whom it discloses, shares, or sells personal information. And, businesses now have some discretion about whether to provide the consumer with the name of the source from which the business received the alleged inaccurate information.

D. Consumers' opt-out status: Complying with opt-out requirements appears easier under the modified proposed regulations. Businesses no longer will be required to display the status of the consumer's choice to opt out of the selling or sharing of their personal information. The modified proposed regulations now make it optional to provide a means by which consumers can confirm that their opt-out of sale/sharing requests, or their requests to limit, have been processed.

3. Agency investigations – giving businesses some grace

With the CPRA effective date just a few weeks away, businesses feel pressure to get their privacy compliance programs into shape. This pressure is intensified by the fact that the regulations still need to be finalized, leaving many businesses without guidance on certain key issues.

In response to this issue, the proposed modified rules introduce Section 7301(b). This section states that: ""[a]s part of the Agency's decision to pursue investigations of possible or alleged violations of the CCPA, the Agency may consider all facts it determines to be relevant, including the amount of time between the effective date of the statutory or regulatory requirement(s) and the possible or alleged violation(s) of those requirements, and good faith efforts to comply with those requirements.""

Considering this section, businesses should make good faith attempts to comply, even though the regulations are not finalized. To do so, businesses should take a big-picture approach to compliance and begin the process in a manner that affords flexibility to account for unanticipated changes in the finalized regulations.

Initially, businesses should focus on: (1) identifying core systems and assets processing personal information, (2) accounting for those processing activities when addressing the CPRA's requirements, and (3) in the event of any known gaps in compliance, introducing mitigating steps that would minimize the potential for consumer harm or regulatory scrutiny.

Until the regulations are finalized, there is some uncertainty as to what CPRA compliance programs will ultimately look like. But at least the proposed modified regulations acknowledge that. The best advice right now is to take a breath and do what you can to comply with the law with the guidance that we have now. Should the final regulations change your approach to compliance, the CPPA may give you some grace.

499,156,Microsoft,2022-12-08,"North Korean hackers exploited Seoul Halloween tragedy to distribute malware, Google says","













SEOUL, Dec 8 (Reuters) - North Korean government-backed hackers referenced the deadly Halloween crush in Seoul to distribute malware to users in South Korea, Google's (GOOGL.O) Threat Analysis group said in a report.The malware was embedded in Microsoft Office documents which purported to be a government report on the tragedy that killed more than 150 people after tens of thousands of young revellers crowded into narrow alleyways.

""This incident was widely reported on, and the lure takes advantage of widespread public interest in the accident,"" the Threat Analysis Group said.

Google attributed the activity to a North Korean hacking group known as APT37 which it said targets South Korean users, North Korean defectors, policy makers, journalists and human rights activists.

Google also said it has not determined what the malware, which exploited an Internet Explorer vulnerability, was intended to achieve. It reported the problem to Microsoft on Oct. 31 after multiple reports from South Korean users on the same day. Microsoft issued a patch on Nov. 8.

A United Nations panel of experts that monitors sanctions on North Korea has accused Pyongyang of using stolen funds gained through hacking to support its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes to circumvent sanctions.

North Korea does not respond to media inquiries, but has previously released statements denying allegations of hacking.

On Thursday, South Korean officials warned businesses against inadvertently hiring IT staff from North Korea.

In May, the United States issued a similar advisory, saying rogue North Korean freelancers were taking advantage of remote work opportunities to hide their true identities and earn money for Pyongyang.

500,265,Microsoft,2022-12-08,Activision sues Calif. agency for records on sex bias lawsuit,"Summary Company seeking agency communications with media, unions

Agency accused of pushing hostile media coverage to force settlement















(Reuters) - Activision Blizzard Inc has moved to force a California civil rights agency suing the video game maker for bias against female employees to disclose a trove of records related to the lawsuit, including its communications with the media and labor unions.

Christopher Skinnell, a lawyer for Activision, said in a lawsuit announced by the company on Thursday that the California Civil Rights Department (CRD) ""unleashed a hurricane of hostile media coverage against the company based on malicious and knowingly false assertions"" in an attempt to force Activision to settle the bias claims.

The CRD in a pending lawsuit filed last year accused Activision of engaging in widespread discrimination against female workers, including by condoning sexual harassment and paying women less than men. A California state judge in August denied Activision's motion to dismiss the bulk of the case.

Activision, which settled a similar lawsuit by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in March for $18 million, has denied wrongdoing.

Microsoft Corp is seeking to acquire Activision for $69 billion. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission issued a complaint on Thursday seeking to block the deal, saying it would suppress competition among videogame developers.

The CRD, which was known as the Department of Fair Employment and Housing until earlier this year, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The lawsuit was filed in state court in Sacramento on Tuesday.

Skinnell, a partner at Nielsen Merksamer Parrinello Gross & Leoni in San Marin, California, says in the complaint that the CRD denied or delayed his numerous requests for records related to the lawsuit against Activision.

The requested records included communications with various media outlets and unions including the Communication Workers of America (CWA) about the lawsuit against Activision. The CWA is seeking to unionize groups of employees at Activision and its subsidiaries.

When CRD did provide records, it took months to do so and the documents included unexplained redactions, according to the complaint.

Skinnell accused CRD of violating California's Public Records Act, which establishes procedures for requesting and disclosing public information, and the state constitution, which gives state residents “the right of access to information concerning the conduct of the people’s business.""

The CRD is already facing a lawsuit by Tesla Inc stemming from the agency's case accusing the electric carmaker of discrimination against Black factory workers. Tesla says the CRD did not follow the procedures required by state law before filing the 2021 lawsuit, which the company claims lacks merit.

CRD has denied Tesla's claims and said it had the authority to file the bias lawsuit.

The case is Skinnell v. California Civil Rights Department, California Superior Court, Sacramento County, No. 2022-80004057.

501,119,Microsoft,2022-12-09,The ghost of Instagram haunts Microsoft’s future,"













NEW YORK, Dec 9 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Facebook is Microsoft’s (MSFT.O) antitrust boogeyman. The U.S. regulatory agency, the Federal Trade Commission, is seeking to block the software titan’s $69 billion deal for gaming giant Activision Blizzard , partly to stop domination of the industry as it evolves. The FTC’s leader Lina Khan might be making up for regulators who waved through Mark Zuckerberg’s $1 billion purchase of Instagram. Though Microsoft’s deal is different, punishment under Khan’s regime seemed inevitable.

The FTC is concerned that Microsoft, the owner of the Xbox gaming console, will withhold popular games made by Activision including “Call of Duty” and “World of Warcraft” from competing platforms including Sony’s (6758.T) PlayStation and Nintendo’s (7974.T) Switch. Microsoft has tried to appease this concern. This month, the company led by Satya Nadella agreed to offer games to Nintendo and Sony for 10 years.

The question is what happens after that. Microsoft could try to corner the market by forcing consumers to not only buy the Activision games from Microsoft, but the platform as well. It’s not a stretch either. Outlook, Teams, and other Microsoft operating systems are now all a crucial part of daily life that enterprises buy collectively, not to mention the $1.8 trillion giant’s cloud capabilities.

Still, how the future shakes out for the gaming business is anyone’s guess. Microsoft’s rationale for buying Activision is to better compete in the gaming market against the likes of Tencent (0700.HK) and others. Online gaming has few barriers to entry, and consoles are going the way of Atari. Streaming is the future, and in that way, Microsoft could easily be sidelined in the business if it doesn’t innovate.

Khan has vowed to rethink the way antitrust laws are applied. The agency is seeking to reconsider concentration thresholds to be adjusted to consider “alternative metrics” and “qualitative factors” beyond market share. That requires regulators to imagine harms that may not yet exist.

Zuckerberg and the year 2012 loom large in that sense. That’s when Meta Platform's (META.O) Facebook bought Instagram, then a much smaller rival. The threat of dominance was hard to see. But that transaction, small as it was, turned out to catapult Facebook into one of the world’s largest beneficiaries of digital ad dollars. Khan may be thinking ahead. But it’s the ghost of Facebook that is haunting Microsoft.

CONTEXT NEWS

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Dec. 8 sued to block Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of video-game developer Activision Blizzard, arguing that the combination would hurt consumers because it would give the software company an unfair edge against competitors of its Xbox gaming consoles and cloud-gaming business.

Microsoft President Brad Smith tweeted, “We continue to believe that our deal to acquire Activision Blizzard will expand competition and create more opportunities for gamers and game developers.”

502,61,Microsoft,2022-12-09,Biden faces uphill battle in spat with Microsoft over Activision deal,"













WASHINGTON, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The Biden administration may struggle to convince a judge to stop Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) $69 billion bid for ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision , because of the voluntary concessions offered by the tech giant to allay fears it could dominate the gaming market, antitrust experts said.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which enforces antitrust law, asked a judge to block the transaction on Thursday, arguing that the merger would allow Microsoft's Xbox to get exclusive access to Activision games, leaving Nintendo consoles and Sony's PlayStation out in the cold.

The Biden administration has sought to reinvigorate antitrust enforcement, with the FTC and Justice Department challenging many more deals than most recent predecessors in industries as disparate as publishing, a variety of medical fields, defense and home hardware.

Microsoft, which said yesterday it is confident in its case, is seeking to close the biggest gaming industry deal in history to rapidly expand its portfolio of popular games and catch up to bigger rivals.

Fixes proposed by Microsoft, including a 10-year commitment to offer ""Call of Duty,"" its popular first-person shooter series, to Nintendo Co Ltd (7974.T) platforms and Sony's PlayStation, give the company a good shot at winning over the FTC judge who will hear the case, lawyers said.

""The legal precedent is not on the side of the FTC,"" said Andre Barlow, an antitrust lawyer at Doyle, Barlow & Mazard PLLC. ""We've had at least three judges that have accepted remedies by the merging parties,"" he added.

Barlow pointed to three recent mergers challenged by the FTC or Justice Department that were ultimately allowed to proceed. In all three cases, UnitedHealth Group's purchase of Change Healthcare, AT&T's bid for Time Warner and Grail's acquisition by Illumina, the buyers offered remedies aimed at blunting antitrust concerns.

Those cases share something else in common with the proposed Microsoft deal: in each instance, a company would merge with a supplier in a so-called ""vertical"" merger. Judges tend to view such deals more favorably than ""horizontal"" mergers, where a company seeks to scoop up a rival, experts said.

""Vertical merger challenges are really difficult to win so it will be an uphill battle for the FTC,"" said Roger Alford, who teaches law at the University of Notre Dame.

Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said in a note that the FTC lawsuit gave Microsoft a roadmap for allaying antitrust concerns by offering further concessions: It could agree to offer Activision games to rivals for the same price, quality and release date as for Xbox.

UNITED STATES NOT THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN

But even if Microsoft can prevail over the FTC in a U.S. court, it still has to satisfy skeptical regulators in Europe.

""The fact that the FTC is taking a run at the transaction"" will embolden the European Union, said William Kovacic, a former FTC chair who now teaches at the George Washington University Law School.

In its complaint, the FTC said that Microsoft had previously told European regulators that they had no incentive to make games from the 2021 ZeniMax acquisition exclusive but then did so with some games.

Reuters reported last month that Microsoft was expected to offer remedies to EU antitrust regulators in the coming weeks to stave off formal objections to the deal. The deadline for the European Commission to set out a formal list of competition concerns is next month.

""There is a strong possibility that the EC will prohibit the merger and they don't have to go to court,"" said Seth Bloom of Bloom Strategic Counsel.

503,446,Microsoft,2022-12-09,Broadcom faces EU antitrust probe into $61 billion VMware deal,"













BRUSSELS, Dec 9 (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O) is set to face a setback in its $61 billion bid for cloud computing company VMware (VMW.N) with EU antitrust regulators poised to open a full-scale investigation into the deal, people familiar with the matter said.

The proposed acquisition, the second biggest globally so far this year, underlines Broadcom's attempt to diversify its business into enterprise software but comes as regulators worldwide ramp up scrutiny of deals by Big Tech.

Broadcom had been banking on early EU approval of the deal by pointing to competition from Amazon (AMZN.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google (GOOGL.O) in the cloud computing market, people familiar with the matter told Reuters in October.

The company had a so-called state of play meeting with European Commission officials earlier this week, the people said.

EU officials usually convey their concerns during such meetings and if companies fail to convince them of the merits of their takeovers, they then launch a full-scale four-month long investigation once their preliminary review of the deal ends.

The EU competition enforcer, which is scheduled to finish its initial scrutiny of the deal on Dec. 20, declined to comment.

Broadcom said it anticipates that the time-line for the review process would be extended in other key regions due to the size of deal.

""Having said that, we're still confident that this transaction will close and be completed in our fiscal 2023,"" the company said.

Beltug, a Belgian association of CIOs & Digital Technology leaders, and its counterparts France's Cigref, CIO platform Nederland and VOICE Germany have previously voiced their fears that the deal could lead to drastic price hikes and tougher commercial practices against customers.

They also warned about the costs and the three to five year period required to switch from VMware to a rival, making it untenable for some customers to do so.

UK GDP grows 0.5% in October after September's 0.6% drop

FTSE 100 down 0.4%, FTSE 250 off 0.5%















Dec 12 (Reuters) - British shares closed lower on Monday, with investors treading cautiously ahead of interest rate decisions this week, while shares of Home REIT hit record low after a short-seller questioned its financial status.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 (.FTSE) slipped 0.4% to mark its weakest close in nearly three weeks.

Investors were gearing up for monetary policy decisions from the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, with both the central banks widely expected to raise interest rates by 50 basis points. ,

""Markets are in a wait-and-see mode this week, with CPI from the U.S. and the Fed. The Fed drives everything and the market will be looking very closely at these two important data points,"" said Andrea Cicione, head of strategy at TS Lombard.

Meanwhile, data showed Britain's economy rebounded in October a little more strongly than expected from September when output was affected by a one-off public holiday to mark the funeral of Queen Elizabeth, but a recession remained on the cards.

Reports on inflation, manufacturing activity and unemployment due this week will give investors a better picture of the British economy.

""In the UK, good data is actually good because of fears that the economy can actually be in a worse situation of a recession than the U.S.,"" said Daniela Hathorn, senior market analyst at Capital.com.

The mid-cap FTSE 250 (.FTMC) fell 0.5% to a one-month closing low.

Enzyme makers Novozymes and Chr. Hansen to merge















Dec 12 (Reuters) - European shares slipped on Monday as investors braced for U.S. and European central bank interest rate decisions, while rising COVID-19 infections in China also weighed on sentiment.

The STOXX 600 index (.STOXX) closed down 0.5%.

Last week, the index posted its first weekly drop in eight as fears of an impending global recession due to aggressive rate hikes from major central banks countered optimism around the loosening of strict COVID-19 curbs in China.

The coming days will be a major test for markets that have been pinning their hopes on central banks scaling back the pace and size of rate hikes, although the strength in U.S. economic data last week cooled some of those expectations.

With recent signs of easing inflationary pressures in the euro zone, the European Central Bank is expected to deliver a dialled-down 50 basis points (bps) rate hike on Dec. 15, a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate announcement.

""The markets are still relying on this narrative that inflation will cool, the central banks will be able to slow down, pause interest rate increases,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.

""But the numbers remain mixed, so it's perhaps not quite as clear cut as the markets would like it to be.""

The pan-European STOXX 600 has fallen nearly 10.4% so far this year as the ECB embarked on tightening monetary policy, alongside global peers in an effort to tame inflation.

""Underlying inflation is unlikely to clearly peak until later in the year (2023),"" Deutsche Bank economists said.

""The risks to inflation are to the upside and the market and consensus views on inflation remain too benign,"" they added.

With surging COVID-19 cases spurring concerns about a disruption to Chinese economic activity, industrials (.SXNP) and some China-exposed luxury firms such as LVMH (LVMH.PA) weighed on the STOXX 600.

Miners (.SXPP) dropped 1.7% as copper prices slipped on economic worries in top consumer China and the U.S. interest rate hike uncertainty.

China-exposed insurance company Prudential (PRU.L) slid 2.7%, leading Europe's financial sector lower.

Meanwhile, Danish food ingredients and enzymes makers Novozymes (NZYMb.CO) and Chr. Hansen (CHRH.CO) said they have agreed to merge. Chr. Hansen shares rose 17.6%, while Novozymes dropped 15.2% after the joint announcement.

London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG.L) shares rose 3.0% after Microsoft (MSFT.O) agreed to buy a stake of about 4% as part of a broader deal to migrate the bourse's data to the cloud.

Sanofi (SASY.PA) slipped after the French drugmaker on Sunday said it pulled out of talks to buy Horizon Therapeutics (HZNP.O).

506,398,Microsoft,2022-12-12,Deal whiz Byron Trott suffers minor grill burns,"













NEW YORK, Dec 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Weber (WEBR.N) is a rare miscue for dealmaker Byron Trott, who typically serves up deals just right. The boutique advisory and investment firm run by the former Goldman Sachs banker, known for having earned billionaire Warren Buffett’s trust, agreed on Monday to buy the U.S. grill-maker at a 43% discount to the price at which it took the company public last year. It’s a reputational blemish for Trott just as he embarks on a major expansion.

Trott’s then-fledgling BDT Capital Partners first bought control of Weber in 2010, and in August 2021 it became the firm’s first initial public offering, at $14 a share, for one of its majority investments. Weber capitalized on the pandemic-fueled outdoor living trend, but supply-chain and inflation woes took their toll and sent the stock price tumbling toward $5 a couple months ago.

BDT, which focuses on family-owned businesses, did not sell down its roughly 60% stake at the time of the IPO, or subsequently. Outside investors may nevertheless recall Trott buying low – 43% below the IPO price, valuing Weber at $3.7 billion – the next time the firm brings a portfolio company to market, and wonder if they’ll get burned.

507,21,Microsoft,2022-12-12,Microsoft plugs into LSEG data drive,"













LONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - LSEG (LSEG.L) has enlisted Microsoft (MSFT.O) to upgrade its data business. The software giant on Monday unveiled a 10-year alliance with the owner of the London Stock Exchange and bought 4% of the $52 billion company. It’s a way for LSEG boss David Schwimmer to boost revenue, though investors will have to wait to see the results.

The tie-up has three parts. First, LSEG will shift its data platform to Microsoft’s Azure cloud business, spending at least 2.3 billion pounds ($2.8 billion) over a decade. That’s part of a broader convergence between exchange operators and providers of virtual computing: Chicago-based CME (CME.O) last month signed a deal with Google’s cloud unit.

Potentially more significant is LSEG’s plan to offer data and analytical tools through Microsoft products, including the Teams messaging platform. That opens a new front in LSEG’s fight with rival Bloomberg, whose proprietary messaging service has long been a competitive advantage. It also allows LSEG to charge customers for data based on how much they consume. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s purchase of shares from a consortium including buyout giant Blackstone (BX.N) and Thomson Reuters (TRI.TO), parent company of Breakingviews, eases a potential overhang on the stock. LSEG shares rose 3% on Monday morning.

LSEG does not expect to see any extra revenue until 2025, but will spend up to 300 million pounds over the next three years to develop the new products. The upgrade will take a while to download. (By Peter Thal Larsen)

508,43,Microsoft,2022-12-12,Microsoft invests $2 billion in London Stock Exchange cloud deal,"[1/2] The London Stock Exchange Group offices are seen in the City of London, Britain, December 29, 2017. REUTERS/Toby Melville















LONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) will buy a 4% stake worth $2 billion in the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG.L), in the latest sign of blurring boundaries between Big Tech and financial firms which have raised some concerns among regulators.

LSEG said on Monday the deal would bring a ""meaningful"" upside to revenues after 2025 from selling more of its existing products via Microsoft apps to broaden the customer base, along with better pricing of products, but it declined to give any specific estimates.

Deepening ties between the handful of big global cloud companies such as Microsoft, Google (GOOGL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and IBM (IBM.N), and financial companies like banks and exchanges, have prompted regulators to scrutinise the links more closely.

Microsoft has a longstanding relationship with LSEG, and the exchange group's Chief Executive David Schwimmer said that about a year ago they began talks on a more strategic relationship.

""It's a long term partnership. In terms of the products we will be building together, I would expect our customers to start to see the benefits of that 18 to 24 months out and we will continue building from there,"" Schwimmer told Reuters.

In November 2021, Google said it would invest $1 billion in CME Group to move the U.S. derivatives exchange's trading systems to the cloud. In the same month, U.S. exchange Nasdaq and Amazon announced a similar multi-year partnership.

Regulators have expressed concern about the over-reliance of financial firms on too few cloud providers, given the disruption this could cause if a provider serving many clients went down.

The European Union has just approved a law introducing safeguards on cloud providers in financial services, with Britain set to follow suit.

""You should assume we do not like to surprise our regulators,"" Schwimmer said, when asked if LSEG has ensured that regulators were on board.

'MEANINGFUL""

LSEG said the link with Microsoft, which gives the software group a seat on LSEG's board, is a partnership to reap the benefits of ""consumption-based pricing"", and not a traditional cloud deal.

""We will continue to maintain our multi-cloud strategy and working with other cloud providers,"" Schwimmer said.

Incremental costs will total 250 to 300 million pounds over 2023 to 2025, with a 50 to 100 basis points impact on EBITDA margin over that two-year period.

Analysts asked Schwimmer to elaborate on his comment about a ""meaningful"" upside to revenues from the deal, but he declined to do so.

""This feels like a key milestone in LSEG's journey towards being information solutions-centric, even if 'meaningful' revenue growth specifics are lacking,"" analysts at Jefferies said.

Jefferies analysts said the deal could ""transformationally"" broaden the appeal of LSEG's Workspace, with a potentially compelling alternative to Instant Bloomberg available for the first time.

LSEG shares were up about 3% and were the top performers on the blue-chip FTSE 100 index (.FTSE) and on course for their strongest day since mid-August.

Microsoft's Frankfurt listed shares were down about 0.4%.

'INTEROPERABILITY'

As part of the deal, LSEG has made a contractual commitment for minimum cloud-related spend with Microsoft of $2.8 billion over the term of the partnership.

The initial focus will be on delivering ""interoperability"" between LSEG Workspace and Microsoft Teams, Excel and PowerPoint with other Microsoft applications, and a new version of LSEG’s Workspace, Microsoft said.

LSEG and Microsoft will look at how they could work together to potentially shift trading or clearing activities to the cloud

""It's in a more exploratory phase at this point, but we will update the market as that continues to develop,"" Schwimmer said.

LSEG bought Refinitiv for $27 billion from a Blackstone and Thomson Reuters' consortium, which turned the exchange into the second largest financial data company after Bloomberg LP.

Microsoft will buy LSEG shares from the Blackstone (BX.N)/Thomson Reuters (TRI.TO), consortium, the exchange operator said. The deal will make Microsoft the seventh biggest shareholder in LSEG, based on Refinitiv data.

Thomson Reuters, which owns Reuters News, has a minority shareholding in LSEG following the Refinitiv deal. LSEG also pays Reuters for news.

Microsoft's purchase is expected to complete in the first quarter of 2023.

BRUSSELS, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) is seeking to address European Union antitrust concerns about its business practices prompted by a complaint from Salesforce.com's (CRM.N) workspace messaging app Slack, people familiar with the matter said.

The move, which may head off the opening of a formal EU antitrust investigation, underscores once again Microsoft's new preference for working out issues with regulators rather than jousting with them as it did in the previous decade.

Microsoft found itself in the European Commission's crosshairs again last year after Slack alleged the U.S. software giant has unfairly integrated its workplace chat and video app Teams into its Office product.

Microsoft introduced Teams in 2017, aiming for a slice of the fast-growing and lucrative workplace collaboration market.

It has made a preliminary offer of concessions to try to allay the EU competition enforcer's concerns, one of the people said.

Microsoft, which has been hit with 2.2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in EU fines in the previous decade for cases involving so-called tying and other practices, declined to comment.

The company has previously said it created Teams to combine the ability to collaborate with the ability to connect via video and that it gained popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic while Slack suffered from its absence of video-conferencing.

The Commission also declined comment.

""As you know the assessment of the complaint is ongoing so we cannot comment further,"" it said.

The EU antitrust watchdog sent questionnaires, its second batch, to rivals in October, asking for more details on Microsoft's interoperability and bundling practices, suggesting it may be preparing the ground for a formal probe, other people familiar with the matter told Reuters last month.

Microsoft is also the target of several antitrust complaints related to its cloud computing and another one over its bundling of OneDrive with Windows.

Dow up 1.58%, S&P 500 up 1.43%, Nasdaq up 1.26%















NEW YORK, Dec 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes rallied to kick off the trading week on Monday, lifted in part by gains in Microsoft and Pfizer, as investors girded for inflation data on Tuesday and a policy announcement from the Federal Reserve later in the week.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) rose 2.89% following the tech giant's deal to buy a 4% stake in the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG.L), helping to boost each of the three major indexes.

After strong gains in October and November, the benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX) stumbled out of the gate in December, and suffered its biggest weekly percentage decline in nearly three months as mixed economic data helped fuel recession concerns.

Consumer inflation data will be closely monitored on Tuesday, and is expected to show prices increased by 7.3% in November on an annual basis, slowing from the 7.7% rise in the previous month, while the ""core"" reading which excludes food and energy is expected to show a 6.1% increase from the 6.3% in the prior month.

""The market is pricing in a 6-handle on the CPI tomorrow versus the 7.3% that is expected, and if it has a 6-handle on it, then that would be reason enough to get all excited, at least short-term,"" said Ken Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors in Boca Raton, Florida.

""The other thing is they are once again expecting Jay Powell to come out and have a dovish tone, which would be a huge mistake. Jay Powell needs to stop giving anyone the inclination they are softening up or they are being dovish.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 528.58 points, or 1.58%, to 34,005.04, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 56.18 points, or 1.43%, to 3,990.56 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 139.12 points, or 1.26%, to 11,143.74.

The rally marked the biggest one-day percentage gain for each of the three major indexes since Nov. 30, and each of the 11 major S&P sectors ended the session in positive territory.

A cooler than expected inflation report would help support the belief the aggressive policy actions taken by the Fed this year to slow the economy are taking hold. The central bank is widely expected to hike by 50 basis points on Wednesday, which would mark a step down from the hikes of 75 basis points in the last four meetings.

Equities were weaker on Friday after a reading of producer prices for November was more than expected, even though it did show the trend was moderating.

Fears the Fed will make a policy mistake and tilt the economy into a recession have weighed heavily on Wall Street this year, with the S&P 500 down about 16% and on track for its first yearly drop since 2018 and largest percentage drop since 2008.

Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN.O) slumped 6.16% after the company paused its partnership discussions with Mercedes-Benz Vans on electric van production in Europe.

Biotech firm Horizon Therapeutics Plc (HZNP.O) surged 15.49% following a buyout offer from Amgen Inc (AMGN.O), while Coupa Software Inc (COUP.O) soared 26.67% after agreeing to sell itself to private equity firm Thoma Bravo LLC.

Weber Inc (WEBR.N) climbed 23.23% after the outdoor cooking firm agreed to be taken private by controlling shareholder BDT Capital Partners LLC.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.35 billion shares, compared with the 10.49 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.67-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.43-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 2 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 73 new highs and 264 new lows.

511,459,Microsoft,2022-12-12,Tech firm says “you’re welcome” with $8 bln LBO,"













NEW YORK, Dec 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Coupa Software (COUP.O) wants its investors to know one thing: Business is terrible. The developer of corporate expenditure-tracking software released a presentation Monday after announcing an $8 billion deal to be sold to private equity firm Thoma Bravo. Once the domain of hockey-stick growth charts and wild-eyed optimism, the humbling of the software industry promises a new era of real-talk. A sale isn’t a bad idea. Investors just need to be convinced they are getting a fair price.

Coupa’s Thoma agreement comes after near-5% shareholder HMI Capital Management warned management about selling on the cheap. The reticence is understandable: Coupa’s shares were down 88% from their peak when news first broke of a possible deal.

Similar deals struck at recent lows also drew opposition, including at software firms Zendesk and Avalara. So Coupa came prepared with a bevy of charts showing growth stalling and management expectations below even analyst estimates. The presentation also details a range of bidders that engaged the company.

The clear message: This is the best you’re getting. And, indeed, at those other companies, loud investor complaints won little. The job of software bosses was once to promise infinite horizons; now, it’s to convince investors they’ve reached the end of the road. (By Jonathan Guilford)

512,264,Microsoft,2022-12-12,"Oracle posts upbeat quarterly revenue on cloud demand, Cerner boost","













Dec 12 (Reuters) - Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) on Monday posted better-than-expected revenue in the second quarter, benefiting from strong demand for its cloud software services and the acquisition of electronic medical records firm Cerner.

Oracle has been pushing aggressively into the cloud computing market to make up for its late start and better compete with larger rivals Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Amazon.com's (AMZN.O) cloud offerings.

For the third quarter, Oracle forecast revenue to rise between 21% and 23% in constant currency, while analysts expect growth of about 17.4%.

Return to offices and hybrid work models have pushed up demand for its suite of cloud software, especially from large businesses. Some analysts even believe Oracle is likely to weather macroeconomic weakness better than rivals, although it has taken a slight hit from a stronger dollar.

Shares in Oracle rose 2.8% to $83.50 in extended trading. They have fallen 6.8% this year.

Oracle said Cerner, which it acquired earlier this year for over $28 billion, contributed $1.5 billion to revenue in the second quarter ended Nov. 30.

Total revenue rose 18.5% to $12.28 billion compared with a Refinitiv consensus estimate of $12.05 billion.

Excluding items, Oracle earned $1.21 per share.

513,316,Microsoft,2022-12-12,North Korean cyber spies deploy new tactic: tricking foreign experts into writing research for them,"













SEOUL, Dec 12 (Reuters) - When Daniel DePetris, a U.S.-based foreign affairs analyst, received an email in October from the director of the 38 North think-tank commissioning an article, it seemed to be business as usual.

It wasn't.

The sender was actually a suspected North Korean spy seeking information, according to those involved and three cybersecurity researchers.

Instead of infecting his computer and stealing sensitive data, as hackers typically do, the sender appeared to be trying to elicit his thoughts on North Korean security issues by pretending to be 38 North director Jenny Town.

""I realized it wasn't legit once I contacted the person with follow up questions and found out there was, in fact, no request that was made, and that this person was also a target,"" DePetris told Reuters, referring to Town. ""So I figured out pretty quickly this was a widespread campaign.""

The email is part of a new and previously unreported campaign by a suspected North Korean hacking group, according to the cybersecurity experts, five targeted individuals and emails reviewed by Reuters.

The cybersecurity experts suspect the hackers are targeting people who are influential in foreign governments to better understand where Western policy is headed on North Korea.

The hacking group, which researchers dubbed Thallium or Kimsuky, among other names, has long used “spear-phishing” emails that trick targets into giving up passwords or clicking attachments or links that load malware. Now, however, it also appears to simply ask researchers or other experts to offer opinions or write reports.

According to emails reviewed by Reuters, among the other issues raised were China’s reaction in the event of a new nuclear test; and whether a ""quieter"" approach to North Korean ""aggression"" might be warranted.

""The attackers are having a ton of success with this very, very simple method,"" said James Elliott of the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC), who added that the new tactic first emerged in January. ""The attackers have completely changed the process.""

MSTIC said it had identified ""multiple"" North Korea experts who have provided information to a Thallium attacker account.

A 2020 report by U.S. government cybersecurity agencies said Thallium has been operating since 2012 and ""is most likely tasked by the North Korean regime with a global intelligence gathering mission.""

Thallium has historically targeted government employees, think tanks, academics, and human rights organisations, according to Microsoft.

""The attackers are getting the information directly from the horse's mouth, if you will, and they don't have to sit there and make interpretations because they're getting it directly from the expert,"" Elliott said.

NEW TACTICS

North Korean hackers are well-known for attacks netting millions of dollars, targeting Sony Pictures over a film seen as insulting to its leader, and stealing data from pharmaceutical and defence companies, foreign governments, and others.

North Korea's embassy in London did not respond to a request for comment, but it has denied being involved in cyber crime.

In other attacks, Thallium and other hackers have spent weeks or months developing trust with a target before sending malicious software, said Saher Naumaan, principal threat intelligence analyst at BAE Systems Applied Intelligence.

But according to Microsoft, the group now also engages with experts in some cases without ever sending malicious files or links even after the victims respond.

This tactic can be quicker than hacking someone's account and wading through their emails, bypasses traditional technical security programmes that would scan and flag a message with malicious elements, and allows the spies direct access to the experts' thinking, Elliott said.

""For us as defenders, it's really, really hard to stop these emails,"" he said, adding that in most cases it comes down to the recipient being able to figure it out.

Town said some messages purporting to be from her had used an email address that ended in "".live"" rather than her official account, which ends in "".org"", but had copied her full signature line.

In one case, she said, she was involved in a surreal email exchange in which the suspected attacker, posing as her, included her in a reply.

DePetris, a fellow with Defense Priorities and a columnist for several newspapers, said the emails he has received were written as if a researcher were asking for a paper submission or comments on a draft.

""They were quite sophisticated, with think tank logos attached to the correspondence to make it look as if the inquiry is legitimate,"" he said.

About three weeks after receiving the faked email from 38 North, a separate hacker impersonated him, emailing other people to look at a draft, DePetris said.

That email, which DePetris shared with Reuters, offers $300 for reviewing a manuscript about North Korea's nuclear programme and asks for recommendations for other possible reviewers. Elliot said the hackers never paid anyone for their research or responses, and would never intend to.

GATHERING INFORMATION

Impersonation is a common method for spies around the world, but as North Korea's isolation has deepened under sanctions and the pandemic, Western intelligence agencies believe Pyongyang has become particularly reliant on cyber campaigns, one security source in Seoul told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.

In a March 2022 report, a panel of experts that investigates North Korea's U.N. sanctions evasions listed Thallium's efforts as among activities that ""constitute espionage intended to inform and assist"" the country's sanctions avoidance.

Town said in some cases, the attackers have commissioned papers, and analysts had provided full reports or manuscript reviews before realising what had happened.

DePetris said the hackers asked him about issues he was already working on, including Japan's response to North Korea's military activities.

Another email, purporting to be a reporter from Japan's Kyodo News, asked a 38 North staffer how they thought the war in Ukraine factored in North Korea's thinking, and posed questions about U.S., Chinese, and Russian policies.

""One can only surmise that the North Koreans are trying to get candid views from think tankers in order to better understand U.S. policy on the North and where it may be going,"" DePetris said.

514,668,Microsoft,2022-12-12,Morning Bid: 4x50,"













A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.

A barrage of major central bank decisions and a critical U.S. consumer price inflation reading this week likely clear the decks in what has been an ""annus horribilis"" for world markets.

While expectations are baked in for a downshift in the size of interest rate rises to 50 basis point moves by all four of the main monetary authorities deciding policy this week, markets remain nervy about the U.S. CPI release and signalling on next year's rate trajectory.

The VIX (.VIX) index of implied U.S. equity market volatility jumped to its highest in almost a month early on Monday, reflecting some of that trepidation as well as year end jitters. Asia and European stocks were lower, with U.S. stock futures flat to negative too.

The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates again on Wednesday but reduce the size of its hikes to half a percentage point to 4.25-5.5%, with another full point of increases priced over the following two meetings through March 2023.

Futures markets still pencil in a Fed ""terminal rate"" next year of just under 5% and any shift in Fed's policymakers' median indications on that - the so-called ""dot plot"" - will likely be very sensitive as they monitor wider financial conditions.

The November CPI report due on Tuesday ahead of the Fed decision may pack as much punch as the rate rise itself - with consensus forecasts for a drop in the annual inflation rate to 7.3% from 7.7% in October, as the ""core"" rate ticks down to 6.1%.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Sunday forecast a ""substantial reduction"" in U.S. inflation in 2023, barring another unexpected shock. Brent crude prices continued to plumb 2022 lows on Monday, with year-on-year change in oil prices now near zero.

The European Central Bank, Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank are also expected to slow their pace of rate hikes to 50bps on Thursday.

The dollar was a touch lower on Monday, with CFTC data from Friday showing speculators opening up their largest net short dollar positions since the middle of 2021. Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields were also down a tad to 3.53% ahead of a new auction of 10-year paper later on Monday.

China stocks retreated earlier as investors worried that rising COVID-19 cases might disrupt consumption and manufacturing. After China made a dramatic pivot toward economic reopening last week, there were rising concerns that infections could spike and cause further disruptions.

Real estate developers' shares plunged more than 4% each on Monday. Both sectors rose more than 30% in November.

Britain's economy rebounded in October a little more strongly than expected from September when output was affected by a one-off public holiday to mark the funeral of Queen Elizabeth, but recession remained on the cards.

In corporate news, Microsoft MSFT.O is to take a 4% equity stake in London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG.L) as part of a 10-year commercial deal to migrate the exchange operator's data platform into the cloud, the British company said on Monday.

Zeekr, one of Chinese automaker Geely's upmarket electric car brands, has confidentially filed for a U.S. initial public offering, aiming to raise more than $1 billion, sources told Reuters.

Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Monday:

* Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem speaks

* U.S. Treasury auctions 3- and 10-year notes

* U.S. corporate earnings: Oracle?

Summary

Summary Companies U.S. stocks, oil prices jump

Treasury yields tick up, dollar flat

U.S. CPI on Tuesday, Fed meeting on Wednesday

ECB, BOE rate decisions on Thursday















Dec 12 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks, oil prices and U.S. Treasury yields all rose on Monday as investors took an optimistic stance ahead of the last round of transatlantic central bank interest rate hikes this year, hoping that the now-hefty pace of increases in borrowing costs will finally slow.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) was up nearly 1.6%, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 1.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) rose about 1.25%. Boosting the indexes was a nearly 3% rise in shares of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), following the software maker's plans to buy a stake in the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG.L).

After a multi-week decline, oil prices also jumped as a key crude pipeline supplying the U.S. closed and Russia threatened a production cut, even as China's loosening COVID-19 restrictions bolstered the fuel demand outlook.

The dollar was virtually flat in thin trading as investors awaited in the release of U.S. consumer price index (CPI) data for November on Tuesday, when a slowdown in core annual inflation is anticipated.

The MSCI all country stock index (.MIWD00000PUS) gained 0.55%, still down nearly 18% so far this year, wiping out all gains from 2021.

In Europe, the STOXX index (.STOXX) of 600 companies was down about 0.5% as investors awaited interest rate moves.

In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) slid 1.3%, erasing some of the previous week's gains stemming from optimism that China is finally opening up its economy with the dismantling of its zero-COVID policy. Japan's Nikkei (.N225) eased 0.2%.

CENTRAL BANK WATCH

Economists expect the Fed on Wednesday, and the European Central Bank and Bank of England on Thursday, to all raise rates by 50 basis points - slowing down from the 75 basis point hikes seen in recent meetings.

Patrick Spencer, vice chair of equities at Baird investment bank, said central banks will start taking a less aggressive stance this week, though Tuesday's CPI data will be critical.

""It's the last important week of the year, after this week you've got no real sort of catalysts. If the CPI is a muted number, we're off to the races and we'll get our year-end rally,"" Spencer said.

But irrespective of the CPI, deflationary pressures are increasing, with crude oil prices down for the year, and iron ore, lumber and house prices also down, Spencer said.

""All this talk of recession, I think it is certainly in the price, it's in the markets. The key about recession is generally employment, and I think employment is going to be stronger than people give it credit,"" Spencer said.

While the Fed is widely expected to raise rates by 50 basis points on Wednesday at its last meeting of 2022, the focus will also be on the central bank's updated economic projections and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference.

""This week's focus is likely to be centered on CPI and the Fed. To us, that is yesterday's news,"" Morgan Stanley market strategists wrote in a note on Monday.

""While it's important for ... year-end trading ranges, the final chapter to this bear market is all about the path of earnings estimates, which are far too high, in our view.""

DOLLAR MUTED, YIELDS EDGE UP

U.S. Treasury yields rose slightly on Monday ahead of the Fed's next move. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was up 4.4 basis points at 3.613% and the yield on 30-year bonds was up 2.9 basis points at 3.579%. Two-year yields, which typically move in step with interest rate expectations, rose 5.8 basis points to 4.388%.

In currency markets, the dollar index =USD was slightly lower at $105.01, not far from the five-month trough of $104.1 hit a week ago. The euro was also flat at $1.0535.

Brent crude futures settled 2.5% higher at $77.99 a barrel, and U.S. crude finished at $73.17 a barrel, 3% higher on the day.

Gold prices slipped as investors stayed on the sidelines awaiting news later in the week. Spot gold dropped 0.9% to $1,780.56 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 1.10% to $1,778.30 an ounce.

516,547,Microsoft,2022-12-13,U.S. Supreme Court to hear dispute over Slack's direct stock listing,"













Dec 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to hear a bid by Slack Technologies Inc, part of Salesforce Inc (CRM.N), to avoid a lawsuit accusing the workplace communication software company of misstatements in its 2019 direct listing - an alternative to an initial public offering.

The justices took up San Francisco-based Slack's appeal of a lower court's ruling last year that an investor named Fiyyaz Pirani could pursue a class action lawsuit against the company and its executives without proving the shares he bought in Slack's direct listing were registered, rather than unregistered.

The company, acquired by Salesforce last year for $27.7 billion in cash and stock, was among the first to offer shares in a direct listing after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the process in 2018.

In initial public offerings, insiders are often restricted initially from selling their shares. In direct listings, unregistered insider shares and registered shares issued pursuant to offering materials are available to investors at the same time.

Because brokers do not differentiate between them, it is practically impossible to know whether a share purchased in a direct listing was registered or not.

In June 2019, Slack registered 118 million shares for resale, allowing 165 million more shares exempt from registration to be traded.

Months later, investors sued in a federal court in San Francisco after the company revealed an $8.2 million revenue hit tied to service outages. They said Slack's offering materials misleadingly failed to disclose downtime issues and the strength of competitor Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Teams application.

The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the case could go forward, rejecting Slack's argument that Pirani could sue only if he could show that the shares he owned were registered under the allegedly misleading offering materials.

The 9th Circuit ruled that blocking lawsuits by investors in direct listings would create a ""loophole"" in U.S. securities law and incentivize companies to use the method to avoid liability for overly optimistic claims.

In its appeal to the Supreme Court, Slack said the 9th Circuit's ruling conflicted with decisions by other courts and would allow investors to sue over offering materials without tracing their stock back to the applicable offering.

Pirani wrote in court papers that previous cases dealt with successive offerings and that the 9th Circuit was the first to consider direct listings.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce business lobby filed a brief in support of Slack, while a group of pension funds urged the Supreme Court to let the 9th Circuit ruling stand.

517,478,Microsoft,2022-12-13,Nuclear fusion triggers an overreaction,"













NEW YORK, Dec 13 (Reuters Breakingviews) - A fusion breakthrough unveiled on Tuesday by the U.S. Department of Energy is a scientific tour de force, and a commercial irrelevancy.

It’s a notable feat that researchers produced more energy from fusing atoms together than they used to start the process. The development has been an elusive goal since the 1930s, promising essentially limitless power from cheap hydrogen found in seawater. One gram of hydrogen theoretically contains as much energy as burning about 10 tons of coal.

To be put into practical use, however, the process needs to be scaled up immensely. That probably will take years, if not decades. And even then, there’s a problem that undermines some of the breathless exuberance over the news.

Unless there are more breakthroughs, fusion probably would take place in massive facilities like today’s fission plants. The cost and time of construction is a bigger hurdle than the price to fuel them. The cost of power from a new nuclear plant runs about five times more expensive than a solar equivalent, Lazard analysts estimate. Meanwhile, if the price of uranium halved, the generating cost of a well-run reactor would only fall about 10%, according to the World Nuclear Association.

Making fusion cheaper and practical could be as big a challenge as fusion itself. (By Robert Cyran)

518,339,Microsoft,2022-12-13,Ukraine’s Nestlé boost is as important as EU aid,"













LONDON, Dec 13 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Numbers never tell the full story. Consumer group Nestlé (NESN.S) on Monday announced a small war-time investment in Ukraine which may be as important for the country’s future as an 18 billion euro European Union aid package agreed on the same day.

Nestlé will invest 40 million Swiss francs (41 million euros) in a new facility that will help to produce cold sauces, seasonings, soups and instant food. The Swiss consumer group, which already has 5,800 employees in the country, will add 1,500 new jobs in the process. Meanwhile the EU struck a deal with holdout Hungary that will allow it to disburse aid to Ukraine next year. It will go some way to helping the government in Kyiv meet its financial needs; the International Monetary Fund estimates Ukraine’s budget deficit at 5 billion euros a month.

While still at war with Russia, Ukraine needs Western aid to help the government pay its teachers, doctors and soldiers, and start rebuilding railroads and power plants. Private investments will be equally crucial to help the economy take off. Nestlé’s soup spending raises the hope others will follow suit. (By Pierre Briançon)

WASHINGTON, Dec 13 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The U.S. battle against inflation is faring even better than its own data suggest. The country’s Consumer Price Index rose just 0.1% in November, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters expected a 0.3% gain.

Rising housing costs were “by far” the biggest driver of the increase, the agency said. Yet a lag between market trends and CPI data means that true inflation is lower than the government’s reading.

The shelter component in CPI is collected through a rolling monthly survey. As new leases are added, they become part of a moving average. It can take several months for CPI to reflect changes in the rental market.

According to the government’s measure, shelter prices rose 0.7% last month, but Zillow’s (ZG.O)gauge of nationwide rent prices fell for a second consecutive month in November, by 0.4%. Once CPI catches up, the inflation picture is going to look much more encouraging. (By Ben Winck)

Dec 13 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.

With headlines dominated by the arrest in the Bahamas of failed crypto boss Sam Bankman-Fried, the regular investment world jockeyed for position before the week's defining U.S. inflation readout and obstacle course of central bank decisions.

FTX founder Bankman-Fried was arrested at the behest of U.S. prosecutors late on Monday, the day before he was due to testify before Congress about the abrupt collapse of one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges.

And the year's near existential crypto implosion continued to reverberate more widely, with the world's biggest crypto exchange Binance on Tuesday halting the withdrawal of major stablecoin USDC. Binance itself is awaiting the outcome of a series of Department of Justice investigations.

Broader markets were more concerned with the first of the week's big macro events - the release of November U.S. consumer price data. Headline inflation is expected to have dropped to 7.3% from 7.7% in October, with core rates ticking down to 6.1%.

Coming a day before the Federal Reserve's expected 50 basis point interest rate hike, the CPI number will be difficult to trade on.

Some analysts feel any surprises from the release may not register until the Fed decision and guidance is out of the way - with that complicated too by Thursday's policy meetings at the European Central Bank, Bank of England and Swiss National Bank.

Implied volatility gauges were pumped up as a result.

Despite the S&P500 registering its best day of the month so far on Monday, the VIX volatility gauge (.VIX) hit its highest in four weeks.

Other markets appeared in more of a holding pattern. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hovered around 3.60%. The Fed's implied terminal rate is stuck just under 5%, even as futures markets continue to price almost a half percentage point cut from there by the end of 2023.

With icy weather snaps across the Northern Hemisphere, oil prices firmed after their recent swoon - but Brent crude remains below $80 per barrel.

Despite the week's big macro events, there was considerable individual stock movement and deal activity on Monday - with Microsoft rising after news of a stake in the London Stock Exchange Group grabbed most headlines.

Rivian Automotive (RIVN.O) slumped more than 6% after the company paused partnership discussions with Mercedes-Benz Vans on electric van production in Europe. Biotech firm Horizon Therapeutics (HZNP.O) surged 15.49% following a buyout offer from Amgen (AMGN.O), while Coupa Software (COUP.O) soared 27% after selling itself to private equity firm Thoma Bravo.

Weber (WEBR.N) climbed 23% after the outdoor cooking firm agreed to be taken private by controlling shareholder BDT Capital Partners.

Chip wars were also in focus.

The United States said it has spoken with its partners, including Japan and the Netherlands, on tightening exports to China of equipment used to make semiconductors. The Biden administration aims to cut China off from certain semiconductor chips made anywhere in the world with U.S. equipment, in a bid to slow Beijing's technological and military advances.

China is responding by working on a more than 1 trillion yuan ($143 billion) support package for its semiconductor industry, sources told Reuters, in a big step towards self sufficiency in chips and to counter U.S. moves.

China stocks fell on Tuesday, as optimism over easing COVID-19 restrictions started to fade amid signs of a spike in infections in major cities including Beijing. Hong Kong announced that from Wednesday international passengers arriving in the territory would no longer face COVID-19 movement controls or be barred from certain venues.

With one eye on widening labor unrest across Britain, the UK jobless rate rose for a second month and there were other signs that some of the inflationary heat in the labor market is cooling as the economy stumbles, including an increase in older people looking for work.

But regular pay rose by a stronger-than-expected 6.1% in the August-to-October period, the biggest gain since records began in 2001, excluding jumps during the pandemic which were distorted by lockdowns and government support measures.

Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday:

* U.S. Nov consumer price inflation report. Cleveland Fed issues Median CPI for Nov, NFIB U.S. small business survey

* U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee starts 2-day meeting, policy decision on Wednesday

* U.S. Treasury auctions 30-year bonds

* France hosts international conference to address Ukraine's urgent winter needs in war with Russia

521,269,Microsoft,2022-12-13,Apple plans to let rival app stores on iPhones in EU -Bloomberg,"













Dec 13 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is preparing to allow alternative app stores on its iPhones and iPads in the European Union as soon as late next year to comply with a new European competition law it had fought, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.

Opening up to outside app stores could present a major threat to Apple's fast-growing services business, but rivals would first have to surmount the hurdle of convincing consumers to leave the security and simplicity of using Apple's own store.

The magnitude of consequences depends on how the U.S. company complies with additional mandates in the European law, known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA).

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and other companies with app stores could receive boosts to sales as a result of Apple's planned change on rival storefronts.

Apple declined to comment. Meta, Amazon and Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment but a coalition of app makers said Apple must fully comply with the DMA to truly open competition.

As part of the reportedly planned change, Apple customers could ultimately install apps without using the company's App Store. But Apple has not made decisions on whether to comply with other provisions of the law, such as allowing for alternative payment systems to its own.

Permitting its payment tool to be bypassed would threaten billions of dollars in revenue Apple collects from charging a commission of up to 30% on App Store purchases.

About $10 billion worth of transactions flowed through the App Store last year, according to estimates from Sensor Tower, a mobile analytics company. At least 70% of the funds go to app makers.

Angelo Zino, a stock analyst at CFRA, said he expects under 0.2% of Apple's total sales to be affected by competing app stores in Europe.

""The ultimate impact will be minimal as most consumers are creatures of habit and are very satisfied with the platform,"" he said. ""We expect a majority of consumers will keep the status quo by utilizing (Apple's) existing app store.""

Enforcement of the European Union's DMA is expected to begin in mid-2024. The law requires big tech companies to open their systems to competitors in hopes of increasing consumer choice. The big gatekeepers, as the law describes them, face fines of up to 10% of annual global revenue for violations.

The iPhone maker has said that allowing sideloading, bypassing its App Store, exposes users to security and privacy dangers. But some regulators and critics, such as ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games, have said those concerns are overblown.

Epic CEO Tim Sweeney tweeted Tuesday that U.S. Congress must pass proposed legislation similar to DMA, or it ""would leave American developers in serfdom.""

Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google has allowed sideloading on phones powered by its Android operating system for years. But to take advantage, users must adjust settings and swipe past security warnings, meaning 90% of downloads still come from Google's official app store, Epic has alleged in court.

522,64,Microsoft,2022-12-13,Microsoft says it offered FTC a consent decree on 'Call of Duty' games,"













Dec 13 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) President Brad Smith said on Tuesday the company had offered to sign a legally-binding consent decree with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to provide ""Call of Duty"" games to rivals including Sony (6758.T) and others for a decade.

The rejected offer, Smith said, was made just before the FTC sued Microsoft last week in an attempt to block the tech giant's $69-billion takeover bid for video game publisher Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O).

The deal has drawn criticism from Sony, maker of the PlayStation console, citing concerns Xbox maker Microsoft would gain control of games such as the ""Call of Duty"" series and make them exclusive to Microsoft devices. Microsoft has rejected the concerns, saying it would not make financial sense to shut out users on competing devices.

Smith, speaking during Microsoft's annual shareholder meeting, said he was disappointed the FTC did not take more time to consider the consent decree proposal before suing.

The FTC declined to comment on Smith's remarks but said generally that it is always willing to consider proposals.

In a move to blunt criticism, Microsoft this month entered into a 10-year commitment to bring ""Call of Duty"" to Nintendo (7974.T) platforms. The company made the same offer to Sony.

The FTC lawsuit threw a stumbling block in front of the tech giant's plans to rapidly expand its portfolio of popular games and catch up to bigger rivals.

The deal is also facing scrutiny outside the United States. The European Union in November opened a full-scale investigation, while the EU competition watchdog said it would decide by March 23, 2023, whether to clear or block the deal.

Britain's antitrust regulator said in September it would launch a full-scale probe.

523,171,Microsoft,2022-12-14,Big Tech gets preview of questions U.S. House Republicans want answered,"













WASHINGTON, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Representative Jim Jordan, who will chair the House Judiciary Committee next Congress, gave a hint of what is to come with letters sent to five big tech companies requesting information about conservative material removed from their platforms.

In letters sent Tuesday and seen by Reuters, Jordan requested the top executives at Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Meta's Facebook provide any information they have about contact with President Joe Biden's administration regarding ""the moderation, deletion, suppression, restricting, or reduced circulation of content.""

Microsoft declined to comment. The other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Republicans won control of the House in the midterm elections, which will give them control of key committees in January with the power to investigate and even subpoena witnesses.

Jordan and other Republicans have argued that the companies stifle conservative voices, something that they have denied.

""House Republicans have written a number of prior letters to you in attempts to obtain relevant information. You have not provided responses that have satisfied our concerns,"" Jordan wrote in the letters. ""Committee Republicans will continue to pursue these matters, including into the 118th Congress if necessary.""

524,78,Microsoft,2022-12-14,"Microsoft targets internet expansion in Africa, longer-term cloud adoption","













Dec 14 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) aims to secure internet access for 100 million more people in Africa by 2025, teaming up with a satellite provider and setting the stage for longer-term cloud adoption, its President Brad Smith told Reuters.

The software maker has long pushed to bring more people online, playing the role of facilitator among telecoms and electricity providers, governments and non-profits. Since 2017, it helped widen connectivity for 50 million people, including nearly 10 million in Africa, under its so-called Airband initiative.

Now, Microsoft is tapping satellite technology for the program for the first time, aiming to reach remote areas that have had little connectivity. In news pegged to the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, Microsoft said Wednesday it is working with Viasat Inc (VSAT.O) to expand access in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other countries globally.

Smith said the effort was ""building a new market for access to the internet, for the use of the cloud, for the power of AI, the ability to harness data. All of these things connect with our business.""

He declined to state Microsoft's financial commitment to Airband but said money ""is in some ways the least important part of our contribution"" relative to its growing partnerships and helping others make sustainable investments.

Africa, he said, represented a burgeoning talent pool in contrast to declining population growth elsewhere. Microsoft now has more than 500 engineers in Nairobi and more than 200 in Lagos, he said.

525,39,Microsoft,2022-12-15,"Australia takes aim at Apple, Microsoft over child protection online","













SYDNEY, Dec 15 (Reuters) - An Australian regulator, after using new powers to make the tech giants share information about their methods, accused Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) not doing enough to stop child exploitation content on their platforms.

The e-Safety Commissioner, an office set up to protect internet users, said that after sending legal demands for information to some of the world's biggest internet firms, the responses showed Apple and Microsoft did not proactively screen for child abuse material in their storage services, iCloud and OneDrive.

The two firms also confirmed they did not use any technology to detect live-streaming of child sexual abuse on video services Skype and Microsoft Teams, which are owned by Microsoft, and FaceTime, which is owned by Apple, the commissioner said in a report published on Thursday.

A Microsoft spokesperson said the company was committed to combatting proliferation of abuse material but ""as threats to children's safety continue to evolve and bad actors become more sophisticated in their tactics, we continue to challenge ourselves to adapt our response"".

Apple was not immediately available for comment.

The disclosure confirms gaps in the child protection measures of some of the world's biggest tech firms, building public pressure on them to do more, according to the commissioner. Meta Platforms Inc, (META.O) which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, and Snapchat owner Snap Inc (SNAP.N) also got demands for information.

The responses overall were ""alarming"" and raised concerns of ""clearly inadequate and inconsistent use of widely available technology to detect child abuse material and grooming"", commissioner Julie Inman Grant said in a statement.

Microsoft and Apple ""do not even attempt to proactively detect previously confirmed child abuse material"" on their storage services, although a Microsoft-developed detection product is used by law enforcement agencies.

An Apple announcement a week ago that it would stop scanning iCloud accounts for child abuse, following pressure from privacy advocates, was ""a major step backwards from their responsibilities to help keep children safe"" Inman Grant said.

The failure of both firms to detect live-streamed abuse amounted to ""some of the biggest and richest technology companies in the world turning a blind eye and failing to take appropriate steps to protect the most vulnerable from the most predatory"", she added.

526,113,Microsoft,2022-12-15,Microsoft to roll out ‘data boundary’ for EU customers from Jan. 1,"













LONDON/STOCKHOLM, Dec 15 (Reuters) - (This Dec. 15 story has been refiled to correct grammar in paragraph 5 to 'need to be taking,' not 'needed to be taken')

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Thursday its European Union cloud customers will be able to process and store parts of their data in the region from Jan. 1.

The phased rollout of its “EU data boundary” will apply to all of its core cloud services – Azure, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365 and Power BI platform.

Big businesses have become increasingly anxious about the international flow of customer data since the EU introduced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018, which protects user privacy.

The bloc’s executive arm, the European Commission, is working through proposals to protect the privacy of European users whose data is transferred to the United States.

""As we dived deeper into this project, we learned that we need to be taking a more phased approach,"" Julie Brill, Microsoft’s Chief Privacy Officer, told Reuters.

""The first phase will be customer data. And then as we move into the next phases, we will be moving logging data, service data and other kind of data into the boundary,"" she said. The second phase will be completed at the end of 2023 and phase three will be completed in 2024, she said.

Microsoft operates more than a dozen datacentres across European countries including France, Germany, Spain and Switzerland.

For big companies, data storage has become so large and distributed across so many countries that it becomes difficult for them to understand where their data resides and if it complies with rules such as GDPR.

""We are creating this solution to make our customers feel more confident and to be able to have clear conversations with their regulators on where their data is being processed as well as stored,"" Brill said.

Microsoft has previously said it would challenge government requests for customer data, and that it would financially compensate any customer whose data it shared in breach of GDPR.

527,221,Microsoft,2022-12-15,Exclusive: ChatGPT owner OpenAI projects $1 billion in revenue by 2024,"













Dec 15 (Reuters) - ChatGPT, the new chatbot that is the talk of Silicon Valley, can spit out haikus, crack jokes in Italian and may soon be the scourge of teachers everywhere facing fake essays generated by the AI-powered technology.

But a question it can't fully answer is this: How will OpenAI make money?

The research organization, co-founded by Elon Musk and investor Sam Altman and backed by $1 billion in funding from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), is expecting its business to surge.

Three sources briefed on OpenAI's recent pitch to investors said the organization expects $200 million in revenue next year and $1 billion by 2024.

The forecast, first reported by Reuters, represents how some in Silicon Valley are betting the underlying technology will go far beyond splashy and sometimes flawed public demos.

OpenAI was most recently valued at $20 billion in a secondary share sale, one of the sources said. The startup has already inspired rivals and companies building applications atop its generative AI software, which includes the image maker DALL-E 2. OpenAI charges developers licensing its technology about a penny or a little more to generate 20,000 words of text, and about 2 cents to create an image from a written prompt, according to its website.

A spokesperson for OpenAI declined to comment on its financials and strategy. The company, which started releasing commercial products in 2020, has said its mission remains advancing AI safely for humanity.

In a taste of what's to come, startups including Synthesia and Jasper, the latter having relied on OpenAI's tech, have drawn Fortune 500 companies to use their video-generation or AI copywriting tools, according to their websites. OpenAI has also attracted attention as an AI provider and potential Google search competitor, with ChatGPT answering queries for more than 1 million users so far.

Microsoft, providing OpenAI capital and computing power for its software, is a beneficiary. Asked about ChatGPT and whether Microsoft viewed such technology as experimental or strategic, its President Brad Smith told Reuters that AI has progressed faster than many predicted.

""We're going to see advances in 2023 that people two years ago would have expected in 2033. It's going to be extremely important not just for Microsoft's future, but for everyone's future,"" he said in an interview this week.

Some investors expressed skepticism. Certain large venture-capital firms passed on backing OpenAI this year, questioning if it could justify a higher valuation or compete with rivals like Alphabet Inc-owned (GOOGL.O) Google, sources familiar with its fundraise attempt who did not invest said.

A ""capped-profit"" structure that OpenAI created in 2019 also represented an unusual restriction for venture capital. OpenAI wanted to safeguard its mission by limiting backers' returns to 100 times their investment, or less in the future.

Others may be doubling down. Microsoft this year has looked at adding to its stake, two other sources told Reuters and the Wall Street Journal previously reported. Its hope is to drive business for Microsoft's cloud as more enterprises embrace AI.

MARKETING GURU

ChatGPT is based on what's known as a large language model, trained with text data so it can answer prompts like a human. Similarly powerful technology that Google built and is narrowly testing with users led one of its engineers this year to say the software was sentient.

Reality is far from that, many scientists say. ChatGPT's responses at times can be inaccurate or inappropriate, though it's built to decline hateful prompts and improve with feedback. OpenAI warns users, ChatGPT ""may occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content.""

The potential to generate flawed answers is one reason why a big player like Google has guarded public access closely, concerned that chatbots could harm users and damage its reputation. Google declined to comment.

The caution has created a void that startups have sought to fill. A company called Cohere, run partly by ex-Googlers, is working on commercial products after a $125 million fundraise led by Tiger Global in February. Another, Adept, announced a $65 million raise in April, and Stability AI touted $101 million in funding after the August release of its text-to-image generator.

Among those building applications atop OpenAI has been Jasper, which says it has drawn 80,000 marketers to draft ads, emails, blogs or other content with its software. The fast-growing company is expected to double its revenue to about $80 million this year, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Its chief executive did not comment on the figure.

Gil Elbaz, co-founder of TenOneTen Ventures, said marketing represented one of the clearest businesses for today's chatbots. CarMax Inc (KMX.N), for instance, has used OpenAI through Microsoft's cloud to create thousands of customer review summaries for used cars that it is marketing, a case study on Microsoft's website shows.

Victor Riparbelli, CEO of text-to-video startup Synthesia, said money so far is ""in a lot of the more boring use cases.""

His London-based company has more than 20,000 customers including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) using its software, which can generate corporate training and product marketing videos, though longer term the goal is AI producing Hollywood-quality content, he said. Amazon confirmed its use of the technology.

Such startups risk OpenAI or Big Tech companies spotting lucrative applications and copying them, which is why Synthesia built its key software in-house. At the same time, application developers could win out financially if technology like OpenAI's becomes a commodity, said Alan Cowen, chief executive at research startup Hume AI and a former Google researcher.

For now, OpenAI must determine how to sustain ChatGPT while shouldering what its CEO Altman described as ""eye-watering"" operating costs.

""I don't think OpenAI intended to make a business out of ChatGPT. I think it functions as a demo ... and a way to gather human feedback for free,"" said Cowen. ""Usage grew a lot faster than expected, so they are now contemplating monetization.""

528,419,Microsoft,2022-12-16,EU greenlights only half of global tax deal,"













BRUSSELS, Dec 16 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The European Union has at last found unanimity on the global minimum tax, half of an almost 140-nation pact to clamp down on global tax avoidance. Hungary finally dropped its veto this week, only for Poland to provide last-minute drama before finally allowing the EU to proceed. Whack-a-mole objections have become EU routine on tax matters, which require the unanimity of the 27 member states.

The other half of the global deal, struck under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development auspices in 2021, concerned big digital services companies. The aim was to make tech giants like Google, Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Apple (AAPL.O) pay a fairer amount of taxes on their profits, regardless of where they are booked. Here the EU is nowhere close to an agreement, and seems headed for a bigger fight.

In the meantime, trade wars over a hodgepodge of national digital services taxes are likely to continue. The U.S. suspended its trade complaints against the UK, France, Austria, Italy and the Czech Republic after the OECD deal. Those battles may have to resume before governments feel motivated enough to make more progress. (By Rebecca Christie)

529,565,Microsoft,2022-12-16,App store avalanche forecast as Apple bows to EU demands,"













LONDON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Apple's rivals are positioning themselves as the go-to alternative to its dominant App Store as the iPhone maker prepares to allow others on its devices in the European Union.

The bloc's Digital Markets Act (DMA) will force Apple and fellow tech giant Google to provide space for third-party app stores on their respective iOS and Android devices.

Under the DMA, which comes into effect on a rolling basis over the next two years, third-party alternatives will have an easier route to getting onto iPhones and Android devices.

And as components of the legislation come into effect, rivals from smaller startups to giants like Amazon and Microsoft may try to lure consumers and app developers alike away from Apple and Google.

Ben Wood, CMO of industry analysis firm CCS Insight, said he expects ""an avalanche of app stores"" in the near future.

""There's an emerging 'coalition of the willing', and all of them have a vested interest in no longer having to pay what they see as a tax to Apple,"" Wood told Reuters.

Apple and Google did not respond to requests for comment.

Android users can at present install apps from alternative sources, a process known as ""sideloading"", but this often requires them to switch off certain security settings.

Apple's apparent concessions on sideloading mark a win for industry leaders such as Twitter owner Elon Musk and Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, both of whom have bemoaned the company's 30% surcharge on purchases made via its App Store.

Rivals are plotting to bring frustrated developers over to their stores, promising lower commission fees and the potential for exclusivity deals with popular apps.

""Competition is a good way to improve services,"" said Paulo Trezentos, CEO of Portugal's Aptoide, which takes a 15% to 25% cut of in-app purchases.

Deals for exclusive content could drive competition in app stores in the same way as it has in the ""streaming wars"" between Netflix and challengers like Disney+ and Amazon Prime, Trezentos said, adding: ""Netflix has content that HBO doesn't have ... App stores can be like that.""

Paddle, a payments processor for software companies, has built its own rival to the App Store, which it hopes to launch in Europe once the DMA comes into effect.

""A 30% fee is actually fairly egregious when we look at it in comparison to how much it actually costs to process payments, and what Apple is actually offering,"" CEO Christian Owens said.

Owens said Paddle's in-app payments system would charge developers between 5% and 10% on transactions.

""The biggest hurdle they are going to need to overcome is the consumer,"" Wood at CCS Insight said.

530,444,Microsoft,2022-12-19,Kirkland inks office lease in expanding Miami legal market,"Summary

Summary Law firms Kirkland signs 115,000-square-foot lease in new tower

Other major law firms, companies are setting up shop in Miami















(Reuters) - Kirkland & Ellis has cemented its launch in Miami by inking a lease in a new 55-story tower that has also attracted other major law firms, including Winston & Strawn, Sidley Austin and Baker McKenzie.

Chicago-founded Kirkland signed a 115,000-square-foot lease taking up six floors in the development at 830 Brickell Plaza, which is set to be completed in early 2023, according to a Monday statement from the building's developers, OKO Group LLC and Cain International.

Kirkland, which has more than 3,000 lawyers globally, said in May that it planned to open a Miami office, announcing its Florida plans the same day as another Chicago-born firm, Winston & Strawn.

Miami has been a hot spot for law firm growth in 2022, with Sidley, King & Spalding and Venable among the firms newly planting flags there. Other firms, including Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, have set up shop in recent years.

Many of the out-of-town law firms are chasing a growing number of technology and finance clients that have moved to South Florida.

The new building that Kirkland has chosen, 830 Brickell, will also be home to Microsoft Corp, private equity firm Thoma Bravo LP, hedge fund Citadel LLC and investment management firm CI Financial Corp, according to the developers' statement.

The other three law firms that have leased space in the building will take up more than 100,000 square feet combined, the statement said, compared to Kirkland's 115,000 square feet.

While Sidley and Winston & Strawn are new to the Miami market this year, Baker McKenzie will relocate from another nearby building.

Summary Companies Fed hikes, recession fears in focus

L3Harris slides after $4.7 bln Aerojet buyout Indexes down: Dow 0.49%, S&P 0.90%, Nasdaq 1.49%















Dec 19 (Reuters) - Wall Street closed lower on Monday for a fourth straight session with Nasdaq leading declines as investors shied away from riskier bets, worried the Federal Reserve's tightening campaign could push the U.S. economy into a recession.

The three major U.S. stock indexes have been under pressure since Wednesday, when Fed Chair Jerome Powell took a hawkish tone while the central bank raised interest rates. Powell promised further rate increases even as data showed signs of a weakening economy.

The S&P 500 (.SPX), the Dow Jones industrials (.DJI) and the Nasdaq have sold off sharply for December and are on track for their biggest annual declines since the 2008 financial crisis.

While U.S. Treasury yields gained, investors ran from stocks, eyeing prospects of safer bets as they worried about the likelihood of a recession in 2023 according to Brian Overby, senior markets strategist at Ally.

""Investors are asking why do I want to take those risks going into 2023 with the Fed's stance still aggressive when I can get such a good yield on the fixed income market place,"" he said.

The lack of big earnings reports or economic data on Monday likely sharpened investors' focus on economic fears and interest rates, according to Melissa Brown, Global Head of Applied Research at Qontigo in New York.

""It's a knife edge between whether we're going to teeter into a recession or have a soft landing. Is the Fed acting appropriately?"" said Brown who also noted that moves may be exaggerated as many investors take vacation around the end-of-year holidays.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 162.92 points, or 0.49%, to 32,757.54, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 34.7 points, or 0.90%, to 3,817.66 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 159.38 points, or 1.49%, to 10,546.03.

The biggest decliners among S&P industry sectors were communications services (.SPLRCL), which fell 2.2%, consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD), down 1.7% and technology (.SPLRCT), which lost 1.4%. Energy (.SPNY) outperformed, closing up 0.13% as the sole industry out of 11 to manage a gain.

Market heavyweights such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) created some of the biggest drags on the market.

Trading in Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) was volatile with the electric carmaker closing down 0.24% after falling as much as 2.8% during the session. This was after a Twitter poll that showed a majority of respondents want Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk to step down as CEO of the social media platform.

Meta Platforms (META.O) shares finished down 4.1% after the European Commission said it could impose a fine of up to 10% of the tech conglomerate's annual global turnover if evidence showed an infringement of the EU's antitrust laws.

L3Harris Technologies Inc (LHX.N) lost 3.6% after the U.S. defense contractor said it would buy hypersonic engine manufacturer Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc (AJRD.N) for $4.7 billion. Aerojet added 1.3%.

Shares of casino operators Melco Resorts & Entertainment tumbled just under 8% and Wynn Resorts (WYNN.O) lost 5.2% while Las Vegas Sands Corp (LVS.N) fell 2.3% after Macau said on Friday that six casino firms will invest around $15 billion as part of new 10-year contracts they signed to operate in the world's biggest gambling hub.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.80-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.63-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 5 new 52-week highs and 20 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 66 new highs and 456 new lows.

On U.S. exchanges 11.07 billion shares changed hands, compared with the 11.59 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

532,472,Microsoft,2022-12-19,U.S. slaps record penalty on Fortnite maker for alleged children's privacy violation,"













Dec 19 (Reuters) - ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games will pay $520 million to settle allegations that it illegally collected children's personal information and tricked people into making purchases, the Federal Trade Commission and the company said on Monday.

It will pay a record penalty of $275 million for violating a children's privacy law and adopt strong default privacy settings for young people. Epic Games will also pay $245 million to refund consumers duped by so-called ""dark patterns"" into making purchases they did not intend to make, the FTC said.

""Epic used privacy-invasive default settings and deceptive interfaces that tricked Fortnite users, including teenagers and children,"" said FTC Chair Lina Khan in a statement.

The announcement comes as the agency has taken a more muscular role in policing the gaming industry, announcing last week a complaint against Microsoft over its $69 billion bid to acquire Activision.

Epic said in a statement on Monday that it had eliminated pay-to-win and pay-to-progress mechanics when two players compete against each other and that it had eliminated random item loot boxes in 2019. It also said that it was putting into place an explicit yes/no choice to save payment information.

It said that players could seek refunds via credit cards. ""If a cardholder sees an unauthorized transaction on their statement, they may report it to their bank to have it reversed,"" the company said in its statement.

To protect children, Epic said it had created features like easier-to-access parental controls and a PIN requirement to allow parents to authorize purchases and a daily spending limit for kids under 13.

The FTC said that Epic employees had expressed concern about the company's default settings in place for children, saying that people should be required to opt in for voice chat. The FTC said that voice and text chat must be turned off by default.

Children's privacy advocates were pleased with the settlement, with Jeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy saying that ""kids should also have their data privacy rights better respected through this enforcement of the federal kids data privacy law (COPPA).""

534,764,Microsoft,2022-12-20,"Meta is building virtual world open to app makers, CEO tells antitrust court","[1/5] Meta Platforms Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg leaves federal court after attending the Facebook parent company's defense of its acquisition of virtual reality app developer Within Inc., in San Jose, California, U.S. December 20, 2022. REUTERS/Laure Andrillon















SAN JOSE, Calif., Dec 20 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) boss Mark Zuckerberg defended his acquisition of a virtual reality fitness app to an antitrust judge on Tuesday, arguing that his company was helping to build a nascent virtual reality industry, not dominate it.

Zuckerberg testified in federal court in San Jose, California, that owning app maker Within Unlimited was ""not that critical"" to Meta's ambitions, saying he primarily aimed to build communications tools and a platform for apps from different developers.

On fitness apps, he said, ""it's less important that we own the experiences than that they exist."" He said he was keen to see other firms build key productivity and gaming apps to draw a mass audience to virtual and augmented reality.

Zuckerberg was defending Meta's proposed acquisition in a high-profile trial over the future of the social media company's budding metaverse business. The Federal Trade Commission has accused Meta of trying to buy its way to the top of the VR industry.

FTC lawyers kicked off the proceedings by asking him about an internal email Zuckerberg wrote in 2015 where he said he expected Meta to build ""most of the apps and software services"" for the VR industry.

Zuckerberg replied that major platform owners tend to build the most popular apps in their area of expertise, likening Meta's emphasis on communications to Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) focus on productivity.

Platform companies have built ""the key apps, what they call the killer apps,"" Zuckerberg said, ""but they're not the only apps available.""

The FTC sued the Facebook and Instagram owner in July to stop the Within deal and asked the judge to order a preliminary injunction, saying Meta's ""campaign to conquer VR"" began in 2014 when it acquired Oculus, a VR headset manufacturer.

The trial is only one of many battles Meta is fighting against regulators globally over its alleged dominance in various markets. The European Commission on Monday said it had warned Meta of a possible antitrust breach related to online classified advertising.

The company said earlier on Tuesday that it does not expect to close the Within deal before Jan. 31 or until the day after the court rules on the FTC's request for a preliminary injunction.

MARKET DOMINANCE

FTC lawyers at the trial attempted to show that Meta had planned to compete with apps like Within, arguing that executives identified fitness as a way to expand VR use beyond its existing fan base of young male gamers.

They displayed a WhatsApp chat between two Meta executives in which one, Jason Rubin, said he had told Within executives that Meta was ""intent"" on getting into the fitness segment.

In the chat, Rubin said he relayed to Within that Meta could move faster if it had a first-party business - one that it owned - but also would ""support everyone like we do with games."" He said Zuckerberg was aware of the plan to deliver that message.

Zuckerberg said he could not recall a discussion with Rubin on the subject.

Meta has poured money into its metaverse-focused Reality Labs unit, recently drawing criticism from investors who have urged Zuckerberg to slow down as advertising sales crumble. Last month Meta said it would cut more than 11,000 jobs.

The social media company agreed to buy Within in October 2021, a day after changing its name from Facebook to Meta.

Zuckerberg told the court he decided to pursue the deal when Meta was in a stronger financial position and that he probably would not make the same decision in the current economic climate.

Within developed Supernatural, a VR app it advertises as a ""complete fitness service"" with choreographed workouts. It is available only on Meta's Quest headsets, which market research firm IDC estimates account for 90% of global shipments in the VR hardware market.

Meta also controls a Meta Quest Store with hundreds of apps, including top app Beat Saber, a dance game that executives considered expanding into the fitness space.

Zuckerberg testified that the Beat Saber proposal never proceeded beyond the brainstorming stage.

The FTC is separately trying to force Meta to unwind two previous acquisitions, Instagram and WhatsApp, in a lawsuit filed in 2020. Both were in relatively new markets at the time the companies were purchased.

535,678,Microsoft,2022-12-20,"Bill Gates upbeat on climate innovation, even if 1.5C goal out of reach","













WASHINGTON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - When it comes to climate change, Bill Gates considers himself a realist - even if that means admitting the world has no chance limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Given ""the overall scale of our industrial economy … we're going to have to do mind-blowing work to stay below 2 degrees,"" he said.

But on meeting the Paris Agreement's 1.5C goal? No one wants to be ""the first to say it,"" but the math shows it's no longer within reach, Gates said in a video interview with Reuters.

The software-developer-turned-philanthropist was nevertheless upbeat about climate innovation - ticking off numerous areas advancing low-carbon technologies with funding from the Breakthrough Energy Group, which Gates founded in 2015.

Gates has invested more than $2 billion toward climate technologies, including direct air capture, solar energy and nuclear fission. The 14-year-old fission company TerraPower, in which Gates has invested, aims to have a demo reactor running by 2030.

These things take time, said Gates, co-founder of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

Gates spoke with Reuters ahead of the release of his annual letter - reflecting on 2022 and describing what he's most excited about in the year ahead.

He transferred $20 billion of his funds to the Gates Foundation's endowment, which plans to increase philanthropic spending on public health and education from $6 billion to $9 billion in coming years.

He also praised Warren Buffett for his contribution, which Gates said totaled $45 billion since 2006, counting Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) stock appreciation.

Breakthrough Energy, however, operates separately from the Gates Foundation charity. In his letter to shareholders, Gates explains that the climate problem is too enormous for philanthropy alone to tackle.

""There's not enough money, and so you have to have some innovation,"" he told Reuters. ""The idea that it can be done by brute force, there's just no chance.""

Companies need investment and technical support to prove their low-carbon ideas beyond the pilot phase - and then to scale up manufacturing, he says. But any of his profits are funneled back into the group or to the foundation.

Some of the companies under Breakthrough that are developing Direct Air Capture (DAC) - technology designed to pull CO2 straight from the atmosphere - have their sights set on some $3.5 billion in newly announced U.S. contracts to build DAC plants and fund research grants.

""We have a number of Direct Air Capture companies that will bid on being a part of those projects,"" he said, noting that the recent Inflation Reduction Act legislation has boosted prospects for climate innovation. He did not elaborate on the DAC companies' plans.

In manufacturing, the steel and cement industries have made ""fantastic"" progress, he said, a change from his worries about that sector just two years ago.

Manufacturing is responsible for about a third of global climate-warming emissions.

Now, ""there's no area of climate mitigation that I feel like 'Oh, that's really completely uncovered,'"" he said.

Instead, with the world set to push past 1.5C of warming, he said the challenge is shifting toward helping people adapt to a harsher, hotter future.

""In addition to mitigation, which will still be the biggest part (of Breakthrough Energy's investment), we'll also fund adaptation-related work."" That could include technology to help control forest fires, using coral reef type structures to create barriers to flooding, or development of crop strains that can withstand drought.

536,26,Microsoft,2022-12-20,Video gamers sue Microsoft in U.S. court to stop Activision takeover,"













Dec 20 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) was hit on Tuesday in U.S. court with a private consumer lawsuit claiming the technology company's $69 billion bid to purchase ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) will unlawfully squelch competition in the video game industry.

The complaint filed in federal court in California comes about two weeks after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a case with an administrative law judge seeking to stop Microsoft, owner of the Xbox console, from completing the largest-ever acquisition in the video-gaming market.

The private lawsuit also seeks an order blocking Microsoft from acquiring Activision. It was filed on behalf of 10 video game players in California, New Mexico and New Jersey.

The proposed acquisition would give Microsoft ""far-outsized market power in the video game industry,"" the complaint alleged, ""with the ability to foreclose rivals, limit output, reduce consumer choice, raise prices, and further inhibit competition.""

A Microsoft representative on Tuesday defended the deal, saying in a statement that it ""will expand competition and create more opportunities for gamers and game developers."" After the FTC sued, Microsoft President Brad Smith said, ""We have complete confidence in our case and welcome the opportunity to present our case in court.""

In a statement, plaintiffs' attorney Joseph Saveri in San Francisco said, ""As the video game industry continues to grow and evolve, it's critical that we protect the market from monopolistic mergers that will harm consumers in the long run.""

Private plaintiffs can pursue antitrust claims in U.S. court, even while a related U.S. agency case is pending. The takeover, announced in January, also faces antitrust scrutiny in the European Union.

The FTC previously said it sued to stop ""Microsoft from gaining control over a leading independent game studio."" The agency said the merger would harm competition among rival gaming platforms from Nintendo Co Ltd (7974.T) and Sony Group Corp (6758.T).

BRUSSELS, Dec 20 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators have asked game developers and distributors if they think Microsoft (MSFT.O) will block their access to Activision Blizzard's (ATVI.O) games once it has bought the company, an EU document seen by Reuters shows.

The U.S. software giant and Xbox maker announced the $69 billion deal in January to help it compete better with leaders Tencent (0700.HK) and Sony (6758.T) but has run into regulatory headwinds in the European Union, Britain and the United States.

The European Commission sent a 91-page questionnaire earlier this month, with recipients likely to be gaming companies, including console providers, game publishers, developers and distributors and providers of PC operating systems, a person familiar with the matter said.

""Please specify which partial exclusivity strategy or strategies you believe Microsoft would have the ability to deploy with respect to Activision Blizzard's console games after Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard,"" the questionnaire asked.

The EU antitrust watchdog asked if such strategies would include degrading the quality or interoperability of Activision's games available on competing consoles or providing upgrades to Activision's games only on Xbox.

Other options were raising the wholesale price of Activision's games for distribution on competing consoles and making them available on competing consoles at a later date.

Companies were also asked if Microsoft would make some of Activision's gaming content and features exclusively available only on Xbox but not on competing consoles.

The document also included a question about Activision's Call of Duty, asking which video game franchise is considered the most important for a console game distributor to offer and what other main alternatives there are to Call of Duty.

Regulators asked what advantages and disadvantages game developers and publishers and console game distributors would face if a game is distributed exclusively on one console.

They also wanted to know the impact for competition between cloud game streaming services if the combined Activision portfolio were to become available as part of such a service.

Rival providers of PC operating systems were asked if Microsoft would have the technical ability to prevent Activision's games from being compatible with non-Windows operating systems.

Microsoft said it continues to work with the Commission to address any valid marketplace concerns.

""Sony, as the industry leader, says it is worried about Call of Duty, but we’ve said we are committed to making the same game available on the same day on both Xbox and PlayStation. We want people to have more access to games, not less,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said.

The Commission, which gave a deadline of shortly before Christmas for responses, declined to comment.

538,522,Microsoft,2022-12-20,EU opens antitrust probe into Broadcom's $61 bln VMware bid,"













PARIS, Dec 20 (Reuters) - European antitrust regulators have opened an in-depth investigation into U.S. chipmaker Broadcom's (AVGO.O) proposed $61 billion bid for cloud computing company VMware (VMW.N), the European Commission said on Tuesday.

""The Commission is particularly concerned that the transaction would allow Broadcom to restrict competition in the market for certain hardware components which interoperate with VMware's software,"" the Commission said in a statement.

Reuters reported on Dec. 9 that the Commission was set to open a full-scale investigation into the deal, the second biggest globally so far this year.

The Commission said its preliminary investigation indicates the transaction may allow Broadcom to restrict competition for the supply of certain components by degrading interoperability between VMware software and competitors' hardware to the benefit of its own hardware.

This and other factors could lead to higher prices, lower quality and less innovation for business customers, and ultimately consumers, the Commission said.

The Commission now has 90 working days, until May 11, 2023, to take a decision.

Broadcom on Tuesday reiterated that it continued to expect the transaction would close in its fiscal year 2023, adding it would continuing to work with the European Commission.

It said it was making progress with regulatory filings around the world, having received legal merger clearance in Brazil, South Africa, and Canada and foreign investment control clearance in Germany, France, Austria, and Italy.

""The combination of Broadcom and VMware is about enabling enterprises to accelerate innovation and expand choice by addressing their most complex technology challenges in this multi-cloud era, and we are confident that regulators will see this when they conclude their review,"" it said in a statement.

The proposed acquisition underlines Broadcom's ambition to diversify into enterprise software, but comes as regulators worldwide ramp up scrutiny of deals by Big Tech.

Broadcom had been banking on early EU approval of the deal by pointing to competition from Amazon (AMZN.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google (GOOGL.O) in the cloud computing market, people familiar with the matter told Reuters in October.

Beltug, a Belgian association of CIOs & Digital Technology leaders, and its counterparts France's Cigref, CIO platform Nederland and VOICE Germany have previously voiced concerns that the deal could lead to drastic price hikes and tougher commercial practices against customers.

539,121,Microsoft,2022-12-20,Netflix will be next on Microsoft’s shopping list,"













NEW YORK, Dec 20 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Satya Nadella keeps thinking bigger. Microsoft’s (MSFT.O) chief executive has been buying new businesses at an impressive clip. Look for him to add Netflix (NFLX.O) to the list in 2023.

Since his 2014 promotion into the technology titan’s corner office, Nadella has embarked on a pricey shopping spree. It started with the $2.5 billion acquisition of the company behind the hit game Minecraft. Later, Microsoft bought LinkedIn for $26 billion and the speech recognition and artificial intelligence software developer Nuance for $20 billion. Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) was by far the largest disclosed target, at $69 billion.

Microsoft is busy fighting U.S. trustbusters for the right to absorb the “Call of Duty” creator. Putting it under the same roof as gaming console Xbox has led to regulatory concerns about market dominance. Even if Nadella loses out on the video-game company for competition reasons, however, owning Netflix would make strategic sense and probably be an easier sell in Washington and Brussels.

The two companies are already closely aligned. Netflix chose Microsoft as its advertising partner for a new advertising-supported subscription service. Microsoft President Brad Smith also sits on the Netflix board. Part of the rationale for a deal is that Microsoft wants to offer a video-game streaming service over multiple devices.

Netflix has its own big plans in gaming. In 2022, the company co-led by Reed Hastings snapped up developer Spry Fox, its sixth in-house studio. Becoming part of the Microsoft empire would supercharge those ambitions. A bundle with streaming TV and games together is not hard to fathom.

With a market value 13 times that of Netflix, as of early December, $1.8 trillion Microsoft can afford Netflix. A 30% premium would value the Netflix enterprise at nearly $190 billion. Significant cost savings would be hard to find, however. And after taxing the $8 billion of operating profit that analysts project for Netflix in 2024, the implied return on investment would only be half its 8% weighted average cost of capital, per Morningstar analysts.

Nadella has defied such back-of-the-envelope financial logic before. And if nothing else, he has shown a willingness to be a bold dealmaker. On that basis, it’s easy to believe Microsoft will set its sights on Netflix.

542,44,Microsoft,2022-12-23,Microsoft tells judges its $69 bln Activision deal would benefit gamers,"













Dec 22 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Thursday its $69 billion bid to buy ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) would benefit gamers and gaming companies alike.

Microsoft made the argument in a filing aimed at convincing a judge at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to allow the deal to proceed, after FTC commissioners said the merger would hamper competition in the gaming industry in a complaint this month aimed at blocking the deal.

In a complaint on Dec. 8, the FTC said its concern was that Activision's popular games, including ""World of Warcraft"" and ""Diablo,"" potentially would stop being offered on devices that rival Microsoft's Xbox. It set a hearing before an administrative law judge for August 2023.

Microsoft President Brad Smith said in mid-December the company had offered to sign a legally-binding consent decree with the FTC to provide ""Call of Duty"" games to rivals including Sony (6758.T) and others for a decade.

""The acquisition of a single game by the third-place console manufacturer cannot upend a highly competitive industry. That is particularly so when the manufacturer has made clear it will not withhold the game,"" Microsoft said in Thursday's filing.

Smith said in a statement this week he was still confident in the company's legal case but remained ""committed to creative solutions with regulators.""

Activision CEO Bobby Kotick said in a statement on Thursday he believes that the companies will prevail in a legal fight with the trade commission.

The Biden administration has taken a more aggressive approach to antitrust enforcement. The U.S. Department of Justice recently stopped a $2.2 billion merger of Penguin Random House, the world's largest book publisher, and smaller U.S. rival Simon & Schuster.

543,247,Microsoft,2022-12-27,Analysis: Dealmakers grapple with unprecedented U.S. challenge to mergers,"













NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Investment bankers and deal lawyers accustomed to regulatory hurdles to their mergers face an unprecedented challenge under U.S. President Joe Biden - antitrust watchdogs who are undaunted when they lose such battles in court.

The U.S. Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have attempted to thwart 22 mergers since Biden came into office in January 2021, according to a Reuters review of announcements from the agencies.

That outnumbers the antitrust challenges during the first two years of former President Barack Obama's first term in office and is twice as many as in Donald Trump's first two years, the Reuters analysis shows.

While comprehensive data going back decades is unavailable, Joel Grosberg, an antitrust lawyer at McDermott, Will & Emery LLP, said more mergers are entangled in U.S. antitrust litigation now than at any point in his 25-year career.

""It's a combination of the FTC and (Justice Department) being willing to litigate and the fact that companies are fighting back,"" Grosberg said.

The DOJ and the FTC managed to stop 15 out of the 22 deals, many without a court fight as companies gave up and walked away from their agreement. More recently, they have lost four attempts to block mergers in court, though they are appealing two of the cases.

These losses have not soured regulators' appetite for challenging mergers. Biden's appointees - FTC Chair Lina Khan and DoJ antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter - are pressing on, arguing that corporate consolidation has gone too far, harming consumers and workers at a time of rampant inflation.

""Without question, what is clear about this team compared to their predecessors is that they are not haunted by the possibility that they might lose these cases,"" said former FTC chair and George Washington University Law School antitrust professor William Kovacic.

Kanter told U.S. lawmakers in September his department would not ""back down from bringing meritorious cases."" In a letter in August, Khan told Senator Elizabeth Warren she believed asset sales to remedy competition issues with mergers frequently fell short.

In response to a request for comment, an FTC spokesperson referred Reuters to recent comments that Khan made in her congressional testimony in September about the effects of past consolidation and the need for stronger enforcement.

The Justice Department declined to comment further, referring Reuters to recent public comments from Kanter on the subject.

The biggest deal currently at stake is Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) $69 billion bid for ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O). The FTC has sued to stop it, arguing it would allow Microsoft's Xbox to get exclusive access to Activision games and put it in a position to dominate the gaming market. Microsoft is fighting back and last week told a judge the deal would benefit gamers and gaming companies alike.

Cary Kochman, global co-head of M&A at Citigroup (C.N), said deals are taking longer to be approved, forcing companies to ""dribble the ball"" and ""delay engagement on potential transactions"" until the regulatory landscape becomes clearer."" Citigroup was not an advisor on the Microsoft-Activision deal.

BRACING FOR BATTLE

Bankers and lawyers are advising merger partners to prepare for long battles with regulators. They are pushing for contracts with more time to complete a deal, to account for the possibility of antitrust lawsuits.

""As you're negotiating things like interim operating covenants that govern what you can and cannot do between signing and closing, you should view them through the lens of having to live with them for 12 to 18 months in some cases,"" said Melissa Sawyer, global head of the M&A group at law firm Sullivan & Cromwell.

Break-up fees that acquirers agree to pay their targets if their deal gets shot down by antitrust regulators are also on the rise. This year's U.S. total of $22.6 billion accounts for 4.6% of deal value, according to Refinitiv, the highest level since the first eight months of 2013, when dealmakers worried about Obama's antitrust crackdown.

Many companies facing merger challenges say they will fight on, emboldened by the four court losses of the Justice Department and FTC. These include lawsuits to thwart health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc's (UNH.N) $8 billion bid to buy health-technology firm Change Healthcare and life sciences company Illumina Inc 's (ILMN.O) $7.1 billion acquisition of cancer test developer Grail.

""For the vast majority of deals, when we assess them from an antitrust perspective, we as advisors believe those deals can get done,"" said Edward Lee, corporate partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis.

544,281,Microsoft,2022-12-27,Activision's Boston studio workers announce unionization,"













Dec 28 (Reuters) - A majority of workers at videogame publisher Activision Blizzard Inc's (ATVI.O) recently acquired studio Proletariat said on Tuesday that they are forming a union with the Communications Workers of America.

The move would make the Boston-based studio, the third Activision Blizzard studio to seek unionization.

The 57 workers in the Proletariat unit – that include animators, designers, engineers, producers and quality assurance workers – said they have filed for a union representation election with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).

Activision said it received the petition on Wednesday and will provide a response to the NLRB in the coming days.

Earlier in July, Activision said that it had Proletariat to expand the development pipeline of its online role-playing game ""World of Warcraft"".

Workers who test games at Activision's unit Blizzard Albany have voted to form a union months after the company began negotiating with employees at its Wisconsin unit, the first in the company to unionize.

Xbox maker Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) agreed to buy the Call of Duty maker for $69 billion, a deal that has faced antitrust backlash from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the European Union and the United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority.

545,479,Microsoft,2022-12-28,Tesla shares record rare jump this month on the way to worst year,"













Dec 28 (Reuters) - Shares of Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) snapped a seven-session losing streak on Wednesday, in their rare rise this month on the way to what will be the electric-vehicle maker's worst year on record.

The stock gained 3.3% on the day. It is set to round off 2022 with a 68% drop - the most among the big U.S. technology firms - as fears mount over slowing demand in China and top boss Elon Musk's growing distractions with Twitter.

""The shorts are piling on and the stock is way oversold here, which could drive a bounce-back rally,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said.

The company, whose meteoric rise over the last few years had burned many bearish investors, is the third most shorted stock in dollar value after Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners.

Reuters Graphics

About 2.85% of Tesla shares, or $8.36 billion, are shorted, S3 Partners said, adding that short selling was up by more than 8.98 million shares this year due to a drop in the stock price, which was partly driven by Musk's share sales to fund his Twitter purchase.

Tesla short sellers stand to book a profit of $16.94 billion, their first gain since at least 2016, compared with a $10.26 billion loss last year.

""When Tesla's stock begins to tick upwards there should be a flurry of short covering ... as shorter-term short sellers look to realize their outsized mark-to-market profits before they evaporate,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners.

Short sellers borrow shares to sell them on the open market in the hope of buying them back at a cheaper price and pocketing the difference.

There could be more short selling until a firm-priced floor is established, Dusaniwsky said.

The stock also saw high trading volumes on Wednesday with 211.54 million shares changing hands, 79% above the 25-day average volume.

Tesla extends gains after Musk's comment

Indexes up: Dow 1.05%, S&P 500 1.75%, Nasdaq 2.59%















Dec 29 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes closed higher on Thursday, led by growth stocks in light trading, as U.S. unemployment data signaled the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes might be starting to dent labor market strength in its bid to fight inflation.

All 11 S&P 500 sector indexes rose, with communication service (.SPLRCL) and technology (.SPLRCT) as the biggest winner with gains of nearly 3%.

""It's just relief,"" said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments in Atlanta. ""Selling pressure has been overwhelming the market recently and we could be having a break. That allowed room for stocks to move, and with lower volume (that) can materialize into a pretty good day.""

Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), whose shares have been battered in the past few sessions, each gained more than 2.5%.

The U.S. Labor Department reported an increase in the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits last week. But the data indicates a tight U.S. job market even as the Fed works to cool demand for labor in its bid to lower inflation. read more

The yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell 2.2 basis points to 3.864% on the news.

The Fed's aggressive interest rate hikes have hammered equities this year, with the benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX) shedding 19.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbling nearly 33%.

The technology, consumer discretionary and communication services sectors (.SPLRCL) - which house several rate-sensitive high growth shares - are down between 29% and 40% this year, making them the worst performers among S&P 500 sector indexes.

Energy (.SPNY) shares have bucked the trend with stellar annual gains of 57%.

Wall Street's main indexes dropped more than 1% on Wednesday, with the Nasdaq Composite Index (.IXIC) hitting a 2022 closing low as rising COVID cases in China and geopolitical tensions added to fears of a likely recession in 2023.

However, investor preference for high-dividend yielding stocks with steady earnings has limited losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI), which is down just 8.5% for the year.

The Dow rose 345.09 points, or 1.05%, to 33,220.8; the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 66.06 points, or 1.75%, at 3,849.28; and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 264.80 points, or 2.59%, at 10,478.09.

Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) shares rose after Chief Executive Elon Musk told staff they should not be ""bothered by stock market craziness.""

For 2022, Tesla's 66% slump and Amazon.com's 50% drop played a big part in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector's 38% loss. Some $1.6 trillion worth of shareholder value evaporated after investors abandoned high-growth stocks with pricey earnings multiples.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.78 billion shares, compared with the 10.95 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 4.80-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 4.30-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 75 new highs and 160 new lows.

547,464,Microsoft,2022-12-29,BC Partners to acquire account-based marketing firm Madison Logic,"













NEW YORK, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Private equity firm BC Partners said on Thursday it has agreed to acquire a majority stake in Madison Logic, a provider of business-to-business digital marketing services.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but a person familiar with the matter told Reuters the transaction valued Madison Logic at about $750 million.

BC Partners is acquiring Madison Logic from Clarion Capital Partners, a New York-based private equity firm that had acquired the company in 2016.

Clarion as well as Madison Logic executives including chief executive Tom O'Regan and co-founders Vin Turk and Erik Matlick will remain minority shareholders in the company following the BC Partners acquisition.

Madison Logic helps businesses track and target enterprise customers with digital marketing to generate sales. The New York-based company was founded in 2005 and has about 250 customers, including Amazon (AMZN.O), Google owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Adobe Inc (ADBE.O), Microsoft Inc (MSFT.O) and Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O).

Spending on business-to-business digital marketing constitutes a small but growing part of the nearly $300 billion U.S. digital advertising market.

Madison Logic competes with TechTarget Inc (TTGT.O) for market share in the U.S. business-to-business advertising sector, which is expected to grow by 15% to $16.5 billion in 2023, according to market research firm eMarketer.

""Within digital marketing, Madison Logic is focused on the business-to-business segment, which is typically less affected than the business-to-customer segment in a recession,"" BC Partners chairman Raymond Svider said in an interview.

""We believe Madison Logic has room for continued organic growth; they can continue to expand beyond existing technology clients into other verticals such as healthcare and industrials; and there could potentially be acquisitions,"" Svider added.

Based in London, BC Partners manages more than $41 billion in assets spread across healthcare, technology, financial services and industrials in Europe and North America.

548,80,Microsoft,2022-12-30,First pre-trial hearing in Microsoft-Activision case set for Jan. 3,"













WASHINGTON, Dec 30 (Reuters) - A judge has set Jan. 3 for the first pre-trial hearing in the Biden administration's case against Microsoft (MSFT.O) over its $69 billion bid to take over ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O).

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which enforces antitrust law, asked a judge to block the transaction earlier this month, arguing that the merger would allow Microsoft's Xbox to get exclusive access to Activision games, leaving Nintendo consoles and Sony's PlayStation out in the cold.

Microsoft has countered that the deal would benefit gamers and gaming companies alike, offering to sign a legally binding consent decree with the FTC to provide ""Call of Duty"" games to rivals including Sony (6758.T) for a decade.

Microsoft made the argument in a filing aimed at convincing a judge at the FTC to allow the deal to proceed.

The case is a sign of the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden taking a muscular approach to anti-trust enforcement. But antitrust experts say the FTC faces an uphill battle to convince a judge to block the deal, because of the voluntary concessions offered by Microsoft to allay fears it could dominate the gaming market.

Summary Companies Wall St booked biggest annual percentage drop since 2008

S&P market cap declined by about $8 billion in 2022

Indexes down: Dow 0.22%, S&P 500 0.25%, Nasdaq 0.11%















Dec 30 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed out 2022 lower on Friday, capping a year of sharp losses driven by aggressive interest rate hikes to curb inflation, recession fears, the Russia-Ukraine war and rising concerns over COVID cases in China.

Wall Street's three main indexes booked their first yearly drop since 2018 as an era of loose monetary policy ended with the Federal Reserve's fastest pace of rate hikes since the 1980s.

The benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX) has shed 19.4% this year, marking a roughly $8 trillion decline in market cap. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (.IXIC) is down 33.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) has fallen 8.9%.

The annual percentage declines for all three indexes were the biggest since the 2008 financial crisis, largely driven by a rout in growth shares as concerns over Fed's rapid interest rate hikes boost U.S. Treasury yields.

""The primary macro reasons ... came from a combination of events: the ongoing supply chain disruption that started in 2020, the spike in inflation, the tardiness of the Fed beginning its rate tightening program in the attempt to corral the inflation,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.

He also cited economic indicators pointing to recession, geopolitical tensions including the Ukraine war, and China's surging COVID cases and uncertainties over Taiwan.

Growth stocks have been under pressure from rising yields for much of 2022 and have underperformed their economically linked value peers, reversing a trend that had lasted for much of the past decade.

Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) are among the worst drags on the S&P 500 growth index (.IGX), down between 28% and 66% in 2022.

The S&P 500 growth index has fallen about 30.1% this year, while the value index (.IVX) is down 7.4%, with investors preferring high dividend-yielding sectors with steady earnings such as energy.

Energy (.SPNY) has recorded stellar annual gains of 59% as oil prices surged.

Ten of the 11 S&P (.SPX) sector indexes dropped on Friday, led by real estate and utilities.

""The housing market has really slowed down and the values of people's homes have declined off of the highs earlier this year,"" said J. Bryant Evans, investment advisor and portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management in Champaign, Illinois.

""That affects people's mind frame and actually affects their spending a little bit.""

The focus has shifted to the 2023 corporate earnings outlook, with growing concerns about the likelihood of a recession.

Still, signs of U.S. economic resilience have fueled worries that rates could remain higher, though easing inflationary pressures have raised hopes of dialed-down rate hikes.

Money market participants see 65% odds of a 25-basis-point hike in the Fed's February meeting, with rates expected to peak at 4.97% by mid-2023.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 73.55 points, or 0.22%, to 33,147.25; the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 9.78 points, or 0.25%, at 3,839.50; and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 11.61 points, or 0.11%, to 10,466.48.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.50 billion shares, compared with the 10.79 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.50-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 85 new highs and 134 new lows.

HONG KONG, Dec 30 (Reuters Breakingviews) - This year has not been short on drama. Our best-read stories of 2022 are testament to that.

Elon Musk’s will-they-or-won’t-they Twitter debacle kept readers on tenterhooks via Refinitiv’s platforms and our two websites, Breakingviews.com and Reuters.com. Among those headlines, a column listing the many reasons why he might not seal the deal proved to be our most popular story of the year, even though the entrepreneur ultimately decided to do it anyway. Another piece posing the hard-hitting question, “What is Morgan Stanley (MS.N) smoking in Twitter LBO?”, garnered plenty of clicks on Breakingviews.com and via Refinitiv.

Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine thrust Russia into the spotlight. Almost a third of the best-read lists tackled the outbreak of war in Europe, and its terrible ramifications. Views on the rouble and the prospect of the country’s economic collapse demanded attention. Its impact on China, India and beyond was a recurrent theme. The seismic shock to oil and energy markets was another.

Deals are a perennial favourite. This year was no exception. Two of our annual predictions, envisaging that Mark Zuckerberg will break up Meta Platforms (META.O), and that Microsoft (MSFT.O) will buy Netflix (NFLX.O), respectively, climbed to the best-read list on Reuters.com just as this piece went to press. A persuasive pitch for breaking up Chinese technology titan Tencent (0700.HK) caused a stir across multiple platforms earlier in the year.

On Breakingviews.com, readers were more inclined to plunge into longer, analytical articles, including a column explaining why it’s time to worry about Greece again, and a deep dive into the financial black hole otherwise known as zero-interest rates. A tasty mix of puns and crunchy arguments helped our coverage of food delivery group Just Eat Takeaway.com’s (TKWY.AS) post-deal indigestion to go down a treat. The sorry story of leveraged-finance bankers’ $1.5 billion writedowns also hit the spot.

On Refinitiv’s news services, a crisis at Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), surging inflation, nail-biting U.S. midterms, and Wall Street job cuts were among the other fast-moving stories to grab eyeballs.

Must-reads were without a doubt the driver for our most-read lists in 2023.

551,2,Microsoft,2023-01-03,Microsoft videogame testers form company's first U.S. union,"













Jan 3 (Reuters) - A group of about 300 videogame testers at Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) subsidiary Zenimax Studios have voted to unionize, the Communication Workers of America union (CWA) said on Tuesday, marking a first for the tech giant in the United States.

The CWA said Zenimax employees at four locations in Maryland and Texas voted overwhelmingly to join the union, but did not provide a tally. Zenimax owns major game franchises including The Elder Scrolls and Fallout.

Microsoft in a statement provided by a spokesperson said it would follow through on an earlier promise to voluntary recognize the union if the workers voted to join.

“We look forward to engaging in good faith negotiations as we work towards a collective bargaining agreement,"" the company said.

Voluntarily agreeing to bargain allows Microsoft to avoid a formal election overseen by the U.S. National Labor Relations Board and the legal battles that often ensue.

CWA President Christopher Shelton in a statement said Microsoft has set itself apart from other tech companies that have discouraged union campaigns.

""Microsoft is charting a different course which will strengthen its corporate culture and ability to serve its customers and should serve as a model for the industry and as a blueprint for regulators,"" Shelton said.

The company in June entered into an agreement with the CWA to remain neutral in union organizing campaigns at Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O), which Microsoft is seeking to purchase for $69 billion. U.S. regulators sued to block the deal last month.

Game testers at Activision units Blizzard Albany and Raven Software voted in 2022 to join unions amid claims by the CWA that the company has threatened and retaliated against union supporters. Activision has denied wrongdoing.

Jan 3 (Reuters) - U.S. tech giant Microsoft (MSFT.O) has commissioned Spain-based infrastructure company Ferrovial (FER.MC) to build a data centre near the Spanish capital, the Cinco Dias newspaper reported on Tuesday.

While the amount has not been disclosed, Cinco Dias cited unidentified sources close to the matter as saying the contract could be worth several hundred million euros, as Microsoft plans a number of investments worth more than 12 billion euros ($12.75 billion) across 17 regions in Europe.

The data centre is set to be built in San Sebastian de los Reyes, a city with a population of about 90,000 some 20 km (12 miles) north of Madrid.

Microsoft is planning another two projects in the Madrid region with the aim of developing cloud services such as Azure, Power Platform, Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365, Cinco Dias said.

WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - There are no ""substantive"" settlement discussions under way between the Biden administration and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to resolve a legal dispute over the Xbox maker's $69 billion bid for games maker Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O), a Federal Trade Commission attorney said on Tuesday.

The FTC, which enforces antitrust law, asked a judge to block the transaction in early December, arguing it would give Microsoft's Xbox exclusive access to Activision games, leaving Nintendo consoles and Sony Group Corp's (6758.T) PlayStation out in the cold.

FTC attorney James Weingarten, speaking in a brief telephonic pretrial hearing, said there were no ""substantive"" settlement discussions between the two sides under way.

Microsoft argues that the deal would benefit gamers and gaming companies alike, offering to sign a legally binding consent decree with the FTC to provide ""Call of Duty"" games to rivals including Sony for a decade.

The case reflects the muscular approach to antitrust enforcement being taken by the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden. But antitrust experts say the FTC faces an uphill battle to convince a judge to block the deal, because of the voluntary concessions offered by Microsoft to allay fears it could dominate the gaming market.

Michael Chappell, the FTC administrative law judge, will rule on the deal after hearings set for August 2023. Either side can then appeal to the same FTC commissioners who voted to bring the challenge, and then to a U.S. appeals court.

The deal faces scrutiny in the European Union which is to decide by March 23 whether to clear or block the deal.

Days later he was back working, seeking investment for his own company Nulink, a blockchain-based payment company, and sent pitches to startup accelerator Y Combinator and Andreessen Horowitz’s cryptocurrency fund.

""As counterintuitive as it may sound, this layoff left me in a really good position,"" the 24-year-old said. ""Because I don't have to pay back the sign-on bonus, I get four months of pay, and now I have time to focus on my own project.""

Szerman is part of a wave of would-be entrepreneurs who are emerging from the ashes of the mass job losses seen in Silicon Valley in the second half of 2022, according to venture capitalists.

U.S. tech giants including Meta, Microsoft (MSFT.O), Twitter and Snap (SNAP.N) have purged more than 150,000 staff, according to Layoff.fyi, which tracks technology job losses.

While overall venture capital (VC) financing fell 33% globally to about $483 billion in 2022, early-stage funding was robust, with $37.4 billion raised in so-called angel or seed rounds, in line with the record level seen in 2021, according to data from research firm PitchBook.

Day One Ventures, an early stage venture fund in San Francisco, launched a new initiative in November to fund startups founded by people who had been laid off from their tech jobs, touting the slogan ""Funded, not Fired"".

The program aims to cut 20 checks for $100,000 by the end of 2022. Day One said it had received over 1,000 applications, most of them from people who were cut loose by Meta, Stripe and Twitter.

""We're investing $2 million in 20 companies - if we just find one unicorn it almost returns the fund, which I think is a really unique opportunity for us as fund managers,"" said Masha Bucher, co-founder at Day One Ventures.

""Looking at the last economic cycle, companies like Stripe, Airbnb, Dropbox have been created in crisis.""

HOT: GAMING AND AI

Also in November, multi-stage fund Index Ventures, which has bankrolled Facebook, Etsy and Skype, launched its second Origins fund, which will invest $300 million in early-stage startups.

Silicon Valley investor U.S. Venture Partners and Austrian VC firm Speedinvest have meanwhile earmarked a similar amount for newly founded companies.

Investors highlighted gaming and artificial intelligence among hot areas of interest.

""With advances in game design, new innovations like cloud gaming, and the emergence of social networking in this sphere, gaming has really transcended into mainstream culture,"" said Sofia Dolfe, partner at Index Ventures.

""In every period of economic uncertainty, there is opportunity - to reset, re-prioritize and re-focus energy and resources.""

DOTCOM BUBBLE 2.0

Szerman said his project was rejected by Y Combinator, while he hasn't heard back from Andreessen Horowitz yet, though he added that other early-stage venture capitalists had expressed interest.

""I told the investors we'll chat in two or three months,"" he added. ""I'll focus on scaling the system now.""

Some investors compared the 2022 downturn to the dotcom crash of the early 2000s, when dozens of overvalued startups went bust, flooding the market with talent and helping to spark a wave of new companies such as Facebook and YouTube.

""Many great companies have been created in relatively dark times,"" said Harry Nelis, partner at investment firm Accel, who sees a new generation of risk takers emerge among the swathe of people left unemployed.

Some industry players say former Big Tech employees are uniquely placed to start their own companies, having seen first-hand how some of the biggest firms in the world operate, and enjoying ongoing access to their network of highly skilled colleagues.

One former Googler has sought to help others like him looking for life after technology giants. In 2015, Christopher Fong, who spent almost a decade working for the tech titan in California, launched Xoogler, a project designed to help former employees hoping to start their own companies. Since then, the group's membership has since swelled to more than 11,000.

Fong told Reuters that experience in Big Tech firm gave founders a ""strong brand that can be leveraged to meet investors, potential customers, and recruit team members"".

555,199,Microsoft,2023-01-03,Lawyers join Polsinelli from disbanding D.C. international trade firm,"Companies Polsinelli PC Follow















(Reuters) - U.S. law firm Polsinelli on Tuesday said it has hired a team of seven international trade lawyers from a small Washington, D.C., law firm that is now dissolved.

Polsinelli said Deanna Tanner Okun, the managing partner of AMS TRADE and a former chair of the U.S. International Trade Commission, will lead its new ITC Section 337 litigation and trade remedies practice. The firm already has a broader international trade practice.

With more than 1,000 lawyers spread across 23 U.S. cities, Okun said Polsinelli offers her clients a broader suite of legal services than her small firm could provide.

""There are opportunities for us to expand the work we do, and for our clients to come to a full-service firm,"" she said.

Okun said the partners at AMS TRADE voted to dissolve the firm at the end of the year; all of the former partners have joined Polsinelli.

AMS TRADE was previously known as Adduci, Mastriani & Schaumberg until January 2022, when Tom Schaumberg left the firm for the Washington firm now known as Levi Snotherly & Schaumberg. AMS's clients have included Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and Nike Inc.

Okun served as ITC chair from June 2002 to June 2004 and again from June 2010 to June 2012. Moving with her to Polsinelli from AMS are Daniel Smith, Lauren Peterson and Lydia Pardini, who are joining as shareholders, and Louis Mastriani, who is joining as a senior partner.

Sean Wesp and Joonho Hwang have joined Polsinelli as associates while Alissa Chase has joined as an international trade advisor, the firm said.

Among its duties, the ITC hears intellectual property disputes involving U.S. imports, and it can issue bans against products that are found to violate U.S. patents. Last month, the ITC held that Apple's Apple Watches with an electrocardiogram function infringe patents belonging to medical device maker AliveCor Inc, though the agency postponed any import ban pending appeals.

556,220,Microsoft,2023-01-03,Apple's stock market value falls below $2 trillion,"













Jan 3 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) stock market value shrank sharply on Tuesday following its steep drop last year, leaving it below $2 trillion for the first time since March 2021.

The sell-off came a year after the iPhone maker became the first company to reach the $3 trillion market capitalization milestone.

Apple's shares declined 3.7% to $125.07 after Exane BNP Paribas analyst Jerome Ramel downgraded the company to ""neutral"" from ""outperform,"" slashing his price target to $140 from $180, according to Refinitiv Eikon.

Also exacerbating investors' worries that a slowing global economy and high inflation may be hurting demand for Apple devices, Nikkei reported, citing unnamed suppliers, that Apple has told suppliers to manufacture fewer parts for its ear buds, watches and laptops.

The drop in Apple's share price put its market capitalization at $1.99 trillion.

Ramel cut his iPhone shipment targets for fiscal 2023 to 224 million units from 245 million units, reflecting supply chain issues from manufacturer Foxconn and consumers cutting back spending on high-end phones.

At Apple's current stock price, the company's value is just ahead of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), valued at about $1.8 trillion.

Big Tech loses weight in S&P 500

With investors worried about consumer demand, analysts on average expect the Cupertino, California company to report a 1% drop in December-quarter revenue in the coming weeks, according to Refinitiv. That would mark Apple's first quarterly revenue decline since the March quarter of 2019.

""They (Apple) tend to skew to the high-end consumer device customer but even that demographic might be being affected by the high price of everything,"" Bokeh Capital Partners' Kim Forrest said.

Last year's steep sell-off on Wall Street punished tech-related heavyweights as investors worried about rising interest rates dumped stocks with high valuations.

The combined stock market value of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O) now accounts for about 18% of the S&P 500, down from as much as 24% in 2020.

Apple vs the S&P 500 since the iPhone's introduction

Even after its 27% drop last year, Apple has provided stellar returns to long-term shareholders. Investors who bought and held Apple shares when cofounder Steve Jobs launched the iPhone in 2007 have enjoyed a gain of over 4,000%, not including dividends, compared to a 180% gain in the S&P 500 over the same period.

557,531,Microsoft,2023-01-04,"Salesforce to cut 10% of workforce after hiring ""too many people""","













Jan 4 (Reuters) - Salesforce Inc (CRM.N) said it plans to cut jobs by 10% and close some offices, after rapid pandemic hiring left it with a bloated workforce amid an economic slowdown.

The cloud-based software firm said on Wednesday the job cuts would lead to about $1.4 billion to $2.1 billion in charges, while only about $800 million to $1 billion will be recorded in the fourth quarter.

Companies from Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) to Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) have slashed thousands of jobs in the past year, in preparation for a recession, expected as a result of aggressive interest rate hikes by global central banks to curb inflation.

Businesses that relied on cloud services during the pandemic are now trying to reduce expenses and are delaying new projects, hurting companies such as Salesforce and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

""The environment remains challenging and our customers are taking a more measured approach to their purchasing decisions,"" Salesforce co-Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff said in a letter to employees.

""As our revenue accelerated through the pandemic, we hired too many people leading into this economic downturn we're now facing, and I take responsibility for that.""

Salesforce had nearly 80,000 employees at the end of the third quarter, up from about 70,000 a year earlier.

The company said in its quarterly regulatory filing that it increased headcount ""to meet the higher demand for services"".

Salesforce shares were up 3% on Wednesday. They lost roughly half their value in 2022 as Salesforce posted four consecutive quarters of slowing growth.

The company lost about $175 billion in market value since its peak in November 2021

""It (the company) is certainly not alone as the sector has grappled with a demand environment that has meaningfully softened over the last 12 months,"" William Blair analyst Arjun Bhatia said.

The move puts Salesforce in a good position to meet its 2026 target of 25% operating margin but the macro backdrop could pose risk to its $50 billion revenue target, Bhatia said.

""There is high likelihood of right-sizing by other software firms,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria said.

558,814,Microsoft,2023-01-04,"Factbox: FACTBOX Tech firms, Wall Street lead job cuts in Corporate America","













Jan 10 (Reuters) - Big Tech firms and Wall Street titans are leading a string of layoffs across corporate America as companies look to rein in costs to ride out the economic downturn.

Rapid interest rate hikes, weak consumer demand and an economic slowdown in China have forced firms such as Amazon, Walt Disney, Facebook-owner Meta and American banks to trim their workforce.

As a pandemic-led demand boom rapidly fades, tech companies shed more than 150,000 workers in 2022, according to tracking site Layoffs.fyi, and more layoffs are expected as growth in the world's biggest economies start to slow.

Here are some of the job cuts by major American companies announced in recent weeks:

Technology, media and telecom companies:

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O):

The e-commerce giant said company-wide layoffs would impact over 18,000 employees.

Meta Platforms Inc (META.O):

The Facebook-parent said it would cut 13% of its workforce, or more than 11,000 employees, as it grapples with a weak advertising market and mounting costs.

Intel Corp (INTC.O):

CEO Pat Gelsinger told Reuters ""people actions"" would be part of a cost-reduction plan. The chipmaker said it would reduce costs by $3 billion in 2023. read more

The ride-hailing firm said it would lay off 13% of its workforce, or about 683 employees, after it already cut 60 jobs earlier this year and froze hiring in September.

Salesforce Inc (CRM.N)

The software company said it would lay off about 10% of its employees and close some offices as a part of its restructuring plan, citing a challenging economy.

Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O):

The networking and collaboration solutions company said it will undertake restructuring which could impact roughly 5% of its workforce. The effort will begin in the second quarter of the fiscal year 2023 and cost the company $600 million.

HP Inc (HPQ.N):

The computing devices maker said it expected to cut up to 6,000 jobs by the end of fiscal 2025.

Financial firms:

Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N):

The premier Wall Street investment bank will start cutting thousands of jobs across the firm, two sources familiar with the move have told Reuters, as it prepares for a tough economic environment in the year ahead.

The job cuts are expected to be just over 3,000, one of the sources said, in what would be the biggest workforce reduction for the bank since the 2008 financial crisis.

Morgan Stanley (MS.N):

The Wall Street powerhouse is expected to start a fresh round of layoffs globally in the coming weeks, Reuters reported on Nov. 3, as dealmaking business takes a hit.

Citigroup Inc (C.N):

The bank eliminated dozens of jobs across its investment banking division, as a dealmaking slump continues to weigh on Wall Street's biggest banks, Bloomberg News reported.

Genesis:

The cryptocurrency firm has cut 30% of its workforce in a second round of layoffs in less than six months, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Coinbase Global (COIN.O):

The cryptocurrency exchange said it would slash nearly 950 jobs, the third round of workforce reduction in less than a year after cryptocurrencies, already squeezed by rising interest rates, came under renewed pressure following the collapse of major exchange FTX. read more

Stripe Inc:

The digital payments firm is cutting its headcount by about 14% and will have about 7,000 employees after the layoffs, according to an email to employees from the company's founders.

Consumer and retail companies:

Beyond Meat Inc (BYND.O):

The vegan meat maker said it plans to cut 200 jobs this year, with the layoffs expected to save about $39 million.

Blue Apron Holdings Inc (APRN.N):

The online meal-kit company said it will cut about 10% of its corporate workforce, as it looks to reduce costs and streamline operations. The company had about 1,657 full-time employees, as of Sept. 30.

DoorDash Inc (DASH.N):

The food delivery firm, which enjoyed a growth surge during the pandemic, said it was reducing its corporate headcount by about 1,250 employees.

Energy and resources firms:

Phillips 66 (PSX.N):

Health and pharmaceutical companies:

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N):

The pharmaceutical giant has said it might cut some jobs amid inflationary pressure and a strong dollar, with CFO Joseph Wolk saying the healthcare conglomerate is looking at ""right sizing"" itself.

559,114,Microsoft,2023-01-04,Microsoft shares lag Big Tech peers as growth worries prompt UBS downgrade,"













Jan 4 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) underperformed big technology peers on U.S. exchanges on Wednesday as its shares fell 5.3% following a downgrade by brokerage UBS on worries over slowing growth for its cloud services and Office suite.

After years of rapid growth in the cloud business that made Microsoft an investor darling, the Satya Nadella-led software giant is now battling lower spending by businesses reeling with rising borrowing costs.

Microsoft's Azure cloud unit ""is entering a steep growth deceleration that could prove to be worse in FY23/FY24 than investors are modeling,"" lead analyst Karl Keirstead warned, adding the market could be reaching saturation.

UBS lowered the stock to ""neutral"" from ""buy"" and cut the price target by $50 to $250. That is lower than the median of $290 and the average ""buy"" rating from more than 50 analysts, according to Refinitiv data.

Microsoft's stock hit a near two-month low of $226, making it the biggest loser on the benchmark S&P 500 index.

It had lost 29% of its value in 2022, but outperformed Big Tech peers such as Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) in a dismal year for the rate-sensitive sector.

Declining spending on enterprise software from companies cutting costs and slashing jobs could also weigh on Microsoft's Office 365 business this year, Keirstead said.

""We don't have as much confidence in the stock ... (at current valuation) to see much (if any) multiple expansion,"" he said.

Shares of Amazon were also down 2% after UBS lowered the price target on the stock to $125 from $165 on concerns over slowing cloud growth.

560,40,Microsoft,2023-01-04,Microsoft to invest in autonomous trucking startup Gatik -sources,"













Jan 4 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is in advanced talks to invest in Gatik, a California-based autonomous driving startup, as part of its cloud partnership with the company, two people familiar with the discussions told Reuters.

Microsoft plans to invest over $10 million in a financing round that values Gatik at more than $700 million, the sources added. As part of the deal, Gatik will use Microsoft's cloud and edge computing platform Azure in developing autonomous delivery technology for trucks.

The terms of the deal could still change, added the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss private matters.

Microsoft and Gatik declined to comment.

Like other big tech companies, Microsoft has recently been putting funds into self-driving technology. In January 2021, Microsoft invested in GM-owned (GM.N) Cruise, which focuses on robotaxis, in a deal that valued the company at $30 billion. Cruise plans to use Azure to ramp up its autonomous vehicle solutions for commercial uses, and competes with Alphabet's Waymo and Amazon's Zoox.

Autonomous driving technologies are seen as revolutionary to the transportation and logistics industry, but have faced setbacks due to regulatory concerns on safety and less accessible funding in a slowing market.

In November, Ford and Volkswagen shut down their self-driving technology unit, Argo AI, saying that creating self-driving ""robotaxis"" would be ""harder than putting a man on the moon.""

Gatik, founded in 2017 by industry veterans Gautam Narang and Arjun Narang, focuses on middle-mile, business-to-business logistics for the retail industry.

Since 2021, it has launched fully driverless commercial delivery services with Walmart Inc (WMT.N) and Loblaw Companies Ltd (L.TO), in which Gatik offers short-haul deliveries in box trucks in Arkansas and in Ontario, Canada.

It has raised more than $120 million from investors including Koch Disruptive Technologies, Innovation Endeavors, Goodyear Ventures and RyderVentures.

In the first quarter this year, Gatik plans to integrate its class 6 autonomous box trucks into the Pitney Bowes (PBI.N) ecommerce logistics network in Dallas, Texas, aiming to boost deliveries and reduce logistics costs.

Jan 3 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is in the works to launch a version of its search engine Bing using the artificial intelligence behind OpenAI-launched chatbot ChatGPT, The Information reported on Tuesday, citing two people with direct knowledge of the plans.

Microsoft could launch the new feature before the end of March, and hopes to challenge Alphabet-owned search engine Google (GOOGL.O),the San Francisco-based technology news website said in a report.

Microsoft said in a blog post last year that it planned to integrate image-generation software from OpenAI, DALL-E 2, into Bing.

OpenAI and Microsoft declined to comment.

Microsoft had in 2019 backed San Francisco-based artificial intelligence company OpenAI, offering $1 billion in funding. The two had formed a multi-year partnership to develop artificial intelligence supercomputing technologies on Microsoft's Azure cloud computing service.

OpenAI made its latest creation ChatGPT chatbot available for free public testing on Nov. 30. The chatbot is a software application designed to mimic human-like conversation based on user prompts and can respond to a large range of questions while imitating human speaking styles.

562,732,Microsoft,2023-01-04,S&P closes higher after Fed minutes confirm inflation focus,"Summary

Summary Companies Stock trading volatile after Fed minutes

Job openings fall less than expected

Indexes up: Dow 0.4%, S&P 0.75%, Nasdaq 0.69%















Jan 4 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 finished higher on Wednesday but below its session peak after volatile trading following the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's last meeting, which showed officials laser-focused on controlling inflation even as they agreed to slow their interest rate hiking pace.

Officials at the Fed's Dec. 13-14 policy meeting agreed the U.S. central bank should continue increasing the cost of credit to control the pace of price increases, but in a gradual way intended to limit the risks to economic growth.

Investors were poring over the Fed's internal deliberations for clues about its future path. After the meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell had said more hikes were needed, and took a more hawkish tone than investors had expected back then.

While some money managers said the minutes included no surprises, the market appeared to have been holding onto hopes for some sign that the Fed was at least considering easing its policy tightening.

""The market is like a kid asking for ice cream. The parents say 'no,' but the market keeps asking because the parents have caved in the past,"" said Burns McKinney, portfolio manager at NFJ Investment Group LLC in Dallas. ""The market still thinks it's going to get ice cream, just not as soon as they thought before.""

McKinney pointed to the minutes for evidence of Fed officials' concern that an unwarranted easing of financial conditions would complicate their efforts to fight inflation.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 133.4 points, or 0.4%, to 33,269.77; the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 28.83 points, or 0.75%, to 3,852.97; and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 71.78 points, or 0.69%, to 10,458.76.

The S&P's rate-sensitive technology index (.SPLRCT) lost some ground after the minutes before finishing up 0.26%. Even the bank sector (.SPXBK), which benefits from higher rates, pared gains but still finished up 1.9%.

Energy (.SPNY) was the weakest of the S&P's 11 major industry sectors, closing up 0.06%, while real estate (.SPLRCR) was the strongest, closed up 2.3%, followed by a 1.7% gain in materials (.SPLRCM).

Also on Wednesday, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari also stressed the need for continued rate hikes, setting out his own forecast that the policy rate should initially pause at 5.4%.

""The Fed minutes are a good reminder for investors to expect rates to remain high throughout all of 2023. Amid a persistently strong job market, it makes sense that fighting inflation remains the name of the game for the Fed,"" said Mike Loewengart, head of model portfolio construction at Morgan Stanley Global Investment Office in New York.

""Bottom line is that, even though we flipped the calendar, the market headwinds from last year remain.”

Market participants now see a 68.8% chance of a 25 basis points rate hike from the Fed in February, but still see rates peaking just below 5% by June. .

Earlier in the day, data showed U.S. job openings in November indicating a tight labor market, giving the Fed cover to stick to its monetary tightening campaign for longer, while other data showed manufacturing contracted further in December.

U.S. equities were pummeled in 2022 on worries of a recession due to aggressive monetary policy tightening, with the three main stock indexes logging their steepest annual losses since 2008.

On the Nasdaq 100 (.NDX) the largest gainer was U.S. shares of JD.Com Inc , which rose 14.7% on hopes for a post-COVID-19 recovery in China. The largest decliner was Microsoft , down 4.4% after a UBS analyst downgraded the stock to ""neutral"" from a ""buy"" rating.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.30-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.74-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted five new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 84 new highs and 51 new lows.

On U.S. exchanges 11.35 billion shares changed hands, compared with the 10.83 billion-share average for the last 20 trading days, which included some volume weakness due to the holidays.

Jan 5 (Reuters) - OpenAI, the artificial intelligence research lab behind chatbot ChatGPT, is in talks to sell existing shares in a tender offer that would value the company at about $29 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The report added that the deal is structured in a way in which venture capital firms Thrive Capital and Founders Fund will buy shares from existing shareholders such as employees.

The deal would attract investment of at least $300 million in share sales, it added.

564,549,Microsoft,2023-01-05,Amazon layoff signals more pain for tech sector as recession fears mount,"













Jan 5 (Reuters) - The massive job cuts by Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), one of the biggest private employers in the United States, show the wave of layoff sweeping through the tech sector could stretch into 2023 as companies rush to cut costs, analysts said on Thursday.

As a demand boom during the pandemic rapidly turns into bust, tech companies shed more than 150,000 workers in 2022, according to tracking site Layoffs.fyi, a number that is growing as growth in the world's biggest economies start to slow.

The layoffs brought back memories of the dot-com bubble at the start of the century and the 2008 financial crisis when tech companies cut jobs in thousands to reduce spending.

""They're trying to protect themselves so that they're not caught in the 2008-2009 cycle that we had,"" said Greg Selker, managing director at executive search firm Stanton Chase.

During the global pandemic, companies ramped up hiring only to reverse course in 2022, with the tech sector leading the job cuts, which according to executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc, surged 649% from 2021.

""It is also giving them an advantage to frankly be more responsible for some of the aggressive hiring that occurred during the pandemic,"" Selker said.

The drop in demand amid a steep rise in borrowing costs has led several executives from the sector to admit they hired in excess during the COVID-19 crisis. read more

Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) axed 11,000 jobs last year, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg saying he had wrongly expected that the pandemic boom would keep on going.

Tech giants Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) have already hinted at cost-cuts, including layoffs.

Salesforce Inc (CRM.N) top boss Marc Benioff said on Wednesday the enterprise software company had hired ""too many people"" as he announced plans to cut 10% of the jobs.

For Amazon, growth in its cloud unit that brings most of its profit has slowed as businesses cut back spending, while its online retail unit is reeling from strained consumer budgets due to rising prices.

""Some of us will remember 2000 to 2003 after a massive bubble fed by cheap money, high investor expectations and plentiful cash,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.

""Whether we see a repetition or not will be very interesting as there is a danger of that.""

BSD's predecessor lost similar patent dispute with Apple in 2014















(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc and its popular live-streaming subsidiary Twitch were sued Thursday in San Francisco federal court by an Israeli company that said their video technology infringes one of its patents.

B.S.D Crown Ltd, formerly known as Emblaze Ltd, accused Amazon and Twitch of violating its rights in a patent related to adjusting the quality of live-streaming audio and video based on changing bandwidth availability.

Emblaze previously sued Apple and Microsoft in the U.S. for infringing the patent. A California jury ruled for Apple in 2014 and Emblaze and Microsoft agreed to drop their dispute in 2015.

BSD's attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday, and a representative for Amazon declined to comment.

BSD said in the lawsuit that Emblaze was founded in 1994 and innovated streaming technology that now ""powers the majority of live broadcasts.""

BSD said Amazon infringes the patent with its technology for adapting video quality in live sports streams such as National Football League games as well as in Twitch live streams. Amazon bought Twitch for $970 million in 2014.

BSD asked the court for an unspecified amount of money damages.

The case is BSD Crown Ltd v. Amazon.com Inc, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 3:23-cv-00057.

566,521,Microsoft,2023-01-06,China’s NetEase buys Halo co-developer SkyBox Labs in global expansion drive,"













HONG KONG, Jan 6 (Reuters) - NetEase Inc (9999.HK) said on Friday it had acquired Canadian gaming studio SkyBox Labs, best known for co-developing hits including Halo Infinite and Minecraft, as China’s second largest video games firm steps up a global expansion effort.

The Hangzhou-based company did not disclose the size of the deal. Founded in 2011, SkyBox Labs has more than 250 employees in Canada. Besides Halo Infinite and Minecraft, the company is also known for being a co-developer behind Fallout 76 and Age of Empires: Definitive Edition.

The move comes after NetEase’ acquisition of Quantic Dream, a French gaming studio behind Detroit: Become Human, in August.

Like its main rival Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) which now manages more than a dozen studios abroad, NetEase has been aggressively expanding its gaming business overseas after regulators tightened screws on China's gaming market, the world’s largest.

It also comes after US gaming titan Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) abruptly ended its 14-years partnership with NetEase in November. NetEase rose to become a gaming giant partly by publishing Blizzard’s games in China in its early years, but the company has been rapidly scaling up its own in-house game development capability in recent years, with self-developed games now accounting for over 60% of the company's revenue.

NetEase’ global expansion drive kicked into high gear in 2022. In Japan, it launched the “Nagoshi Studio” in January under the leadership of Toshihiro Nagoshi, the veteran producer behind the Yakuza franchise. Later in October, it founded GPTrack50 helmed by industry veteran Hiroyuki Kobayashi.

It launched its first U.S. studio, Jackalope Games, in May and three months later opened its second, Jar of Sparks, led by Jerry Hook who was the head of design for Halo Infinite.

Skybox Labs helps develop many games owned by Microsoft (MSFT.O). NetEase is Microsoft's partner in China as it publishes Minecraft for the U.S. giant.

NetEase said that SkyBox Labs will continue to operate independently within NetEase Games under the leadership of its three co-founders, and provide a full range of game development services to current and future partners. It added that Skybox Labs will continue to grow, retain staff and hire new employees in Canada.

The company's founder William Ding said in May last year that NetEase generated more than 10% of its quarterly gaming revenue overseas but that it aims to increase it to nearly 50%.

567,834,Microsoft,2023-01-06,Exclusive: Russian hackers targeted U.S. nuclear scientists,"













LONDON/WASHINGTON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - A Russian hacking team known as Cold River targeted three nuclear research laboratories in the United States this past summer, according to internet records reviewed by Reuters and five cyber security experts.

Between August and September, as President Vladimir Putin indicated Russia would be willing to use nuclear weapons to defend its territory, Cold River targeted the Brookhaven (BNL), Argonne (ANL) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL), according to internet records that showed the hackers creating fake login pages for each institution and emailing nuclear scientists in a bid to make them reveal their passwords.

Reuters was unable to determine why the labs were targeted or if any attempted intrusion was successful. A BNL spokesperson declined to comment. LLNL did not respond to a request for comment. An ANL spokesperson referred questions to the U.S. Department of Energy, which declined to comment.

Cold River has escalated its hacking campaign against Kyiv's allies since the invasion of Ukraine, according to cybersecurity researchers and western government officials. The digital blitz against the U.S. labs occurred as U.N. experts entered Russian-controlled Ukrainian territory to inspect Europe's biggest atomic power plant and assess the risk of what both sides said could be a devastating radiation disaster amid heavy shelling nearby.

Cold River, which first appeared on the radar of intelligence professionals after targeting Britain's foreign office in 2016, has been involved in dozens of other high-profile hacking incidents in recent years, according to interviews with nine cybersecurity firms. Reuters traced email accounts used in its hacking operations between 2015 and 2020 to an IT worker in the Russian city of Syktyvkar.

""This is one of the most important hacking groups you’ve never heard of,"" said Adam Meyers, senior vice president of intelligence at U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. ""They are involved in directly supporting Kremlin information operations.""

Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), the domestic security agency that also conducts espionage campaigns for Moscow, and Russia's embassy in Washington did not respond to emailed requests for comment.

Western officials say the Russian government is a global leader in hacking and uses cyber-espionage to spy on foreign governments and industries to seek a competitive advantage. However, Moscow has consistently denied that it carries out hacking operations.

Reuters showed its findings to five industry experts who confirmed the involvement of Cold River in the attempted nuclear labs hacks, based on shared digital fingerprints that researchers have historically tied to the group.

The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) declined to comment on Cold River's activities. Britain's Global Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), its NSA equivalent, did not comment. The foreign office declined to comment.

'INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION'

In May, Cold River broke into and leaked emails belonging to the former head of Britain's MI6 spy service. That was just one of several 'hack and leak' operations last year by Russia-linked hackers in which confidential communications were made public in Britain, Poland and Latvia, according to cybersecurity experts and Eastern European security officials.

In another recent espionage operation targeting critics of Moscow, Cold River registered domain names designed to imitate at least three European NGOs investigating war crimes, according to French cybersecurity firm SEKOIA.IO.

The NGO-related hacking attempts occurred just before and after the October 18 launch of a report by a U.N. independent commission of enquiry that found Russian forces were responsible for the ""vast majority"" of human rights violations in the early weeks of the Ukraine war, which Russia has called a special military operation.

In a blog post, SEKOIA.IO said that, based on its targeting of the NGOs, Cold River was seeking to contribute to ""Russian intelligence collection about identiﬁed war crime-related evidence and/or international justice procedures."" Reuters was unable independently to confirm why Cold River targeted the NGOs.

The Commission for International Justice and Accountability (CIJA), a nonprofit founded by a veteran war crimes investigator, said it had been repeatedly targeted by Russian-backed hackers in the past eight years without success. The other two NGOs, the International Center of Nonviolent Conflict and the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, did not respond to requests for comment.

Russia's embassy in Washington did not return a request seeking comment about the attempted hack against CIJA.

Cold River has employed tactics such as tricking people into entering their usernames and passwords on fake websites to gain access to their computer systems, security researchers told Reuters. To do this, Cold River has used a variety of email accounts to register domain names such as ""goo-link.online"" and ""online365-office.com"" which at a glance look similar to legitimate services operated by firms like Google and Microsoft, the security researchers said.

DEEP TIES TO RUSSIA

Cold River made several missteps in recent years that allowed cybersecurity analysts to pinpoint the exact location and identity of one of its members, providing the clearest indication yet of the group's Russian origin, according to experts from Internet giant Google, British defense contractor BAE, and U.S. intelligence firm Nisos.

Multiple personal email addresses used to set up Cold River missions belong to Andrey Korinets, a 35-year-old IT worker and bodybuilder in Syktyvkar, about 1,600 km (1,000 miles) northeast of Moscow. Usage of these accounts left a trail of digital evidence from different hacks back to Korinets' online life, including social media accounts and personal websites.

Billy Leonard, a Security Engineer on Google's Threat Analysis Group who investigates nation state hacking, said Korinets was involved. ""Google has tied this individual to the Russian hacking group Cold River and their early operations,"" he said.

Vincas Ciziunas, a security researcher at Nisos who also connected Korinets' email addresses to Cold River activity, said the IT worker appeared to be a ""central figure"" in the Syktyvkar hacking community, historically. Ciziunas discovered a series of Russian language internet forums, including an eZine, where Korinets had discussed hacking, and shared those posts with Reuters.

Korinets confirmed that he owned the relevant email accounts in an interview with Reuters but he denied any knowledge of Cold River. He said his only experience with hacking came years ago when he was fined by a Russian court over a computer crime committed during a business dispute with a former customer.

Reuters was able separately to confirm Korinets' links to Cold River by using data compiled through cybersecurity research platforms Constella Intelligence and DomainTools, which help identify the owners of websites: the data showed that Korinets' email addresses registered numerous websites used in Cold River hacking campaigns between 2015 and 2020.

It is unclear whether Korinets has been involved in hacking operations since 2020. He offered no explanation of why these email addresses were used and did not respond to further phone calls and emailed questions.

568,95,Microsoft,2023-01-10,"Microsoft in talks to invest $10 bln in ChatGPT-owner OpenAI, Semafor reports","













Jan 10 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is in talks to invest $10 billion in ChatGPT-owner OpenAI as part of funding that will value the firm at $29 billion, Semafor reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The news underscores rising interest in the artificial intelligence company, whose chatbot has dazzled amateurs and industry experts with its ability to spit out haikus, debug code and answer questions while imitating human speech.

The funding could also include other venture firms and documents sent to prospective investors outlining its terms indicated a targeted close by the end of 2022, according to the report.

Microsoft declined to comment, while OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

The software giant had in 2019 invested $1 billion in OpenAI, founded by Elon Musk and Sam Altman. Microsoft's cloud services arm also provides the computing power needed by the AI firm.

Microsoft last year unveiled plans to integrate image-generation software from OpenAI into its search engine Bing. A recent report from the Information said similar plans were underway for ChatGPT as Microsoft looks to take on market leader Google Search.

According to Semafor, Microsoft will also get 75% of OpenAI's profits until it recoups its initial investment.

After hitting that threshold, Microsoft would have a 49% stake in OpenAI, with other investors taking another 49% and OpenAI's nonprofit parent getting 2%, Semafor said.

Reuters reported last month a recent pitch by OpenAI to investors said the organization expects $200 million in revenue next year and $1 billion by 2024.

OpenAI charges developers licensing its technology about a penny or a little more to generate 20,000 words of text, and about 2 cents to create an image from a written prompt.

It spends about a few cents in computing power every time someone uses its chatbot, Altman recently said in tweet that has raised concerns about OpenAI's cash burn.

569,120,Microsoft,2023-01-10,"Breakingviews: Microsoft’s AI bet: heads I win, tails I also win","













NEW YORK, Jan 10 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) is mulling a heads-I-win, tails-I-also win, AI deal. A mooted $10 billion investment, reported by Semafor, in the maker of the popular ChatGPT, could reshape Microsoft’s software business. Even if it flops, CEO Satya Nadella will slow a rival, and possibly regain much of its investment.

The $29 billion price tag placed on OpenAI is high, but defensible. The company aims to grow sales to $1 billion next year, according to a Reuters report. That would value the firm at 29 times 2024 revenue. Enterprise software group Snowflake (SNOW.N) is trading at 13 times 2024 revenue, but it’s growing nowhere near OpenAI’s rate. And the investment is a pittance compared to Microsoft’s market capitalization of $1.7 trillion and $107 billion of cash on hand.

The financial potential of artificial intelligence, though, is vast and probably bigger than all current software spending. Designing a better search engine, one that intuitively knows exactly what users are looking for, would be a major threat to Google Owner Alphabet’s (GOOGL.O) $1.1 trillion valuation. The next step could be AI programs that quickly write better software and design more effective drugs, creating even bigger potential markets. Moreover, the biggest uses for new IT platforms often emerge after experimentation in the wild.

Of course, the odds are OpenAI will fade away, as most tech firms do. Even then, Microsoft’s investment may not be wasted. Alphabet has spent about $100 billion on research and development, betting hard on such products over the past three years alone, and will grow its spending by 13% annually in the next three years, Morgan Stanley reckons. By locking up a promising firm, and scarce researchers, Microsoft may prevent Alphabet from winning, and may force it to raise spending.

Clever dealmaking cuts Microsoft’s risk further. OpenAI already runs on Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform thanks to a 2019 agreement between the two. The proposed investment means OpenAI can grow its business faster, which also benefits Azure, a part of Microsoft that investors value highly. Furthermore, the new agreement gives Microsoft 75% of OpenAI’s profit until its investment is recouped.

Tech bets may be coin flips, but this one is worth taking.

Summary Companies Investors await CPI data Thursday

U.S. earnings season begins this week

Jefferies shares rise after results

Indexes: Dow up 0.6%, S&P 500 up 0.7%, Nasdaq up 1%















NEW YORK, Jan 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended solidly higher on Tuesday, led by a 1% gain in the Nasdaq, on relief that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell refrained in a speech from commenting on rate policy.

In his first public appearance of the year, Powell said at a forum sponsored by the Swedish central bank that the Fed's independence is essential for it to battle inflation.

Recent comments by other Fed officials have supported the view that the central bank needs to remain aggressive in raising interest rates to control inflation. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said on Tuesday the bank will have to raise interest rates further to combat high inflation.

""Everybody hangs on every word from the Fed,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York. Powell ""didn't really say anything"" about policy, he added.

Investors anxiously awaited the U.S. consumer prices index report Thursday, which is expected to show some moderation in year-on-year prices in December.

Traders are betting on a 25-basis point rate hike at the Fed's upcoming policy meeting in February.

""There are some indications that inflation is slowing significantly. What investors are really looking for is a gap down in major inflation data that could probably get the Fed's attention,"" Ghriskey said.

Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN.O) shares rose 2.9% and gave the Nasdaq and S&P 500 their biggest boosts.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 186.45 points, or 0.56%, to 33,704.1; the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 27.16 points, or 0.70%, at 3,919.25; and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 106.98 points, or 1.01%, at 10,742.63.

Shares of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) rose 0.8%, a day after Semafor, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that the tech company was in talks to invest $10 billion in ChatGPT-owner OpenAI.

Communications services (.SPLRCL) was the day's best-performing sector, while energy (.SPNY) rose along with oil prices.

This week marks the start of the fourth-quarter earnings season for S&P 500 companies, with results from several of Wall Street's biggest banks due later this week.

Shares of investment bank Jefferies Financial Group (JEF.N) rose 3.8% on Tuesday, a day after it posted its second-best year for investment banking revenue. It also reported a 52.5% slump in fourth-quarter profit.

Analysts expect overall S&P 500 earnings to have declined 2.2% in the fourth quarter from a year ago, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, as worries about rising rates and the economy mounted.

Some investors are hoping for signs that the Fed may soon take a break after raising the federal funds rate seven times in 2022.

The World Bank on Tuesday slashed its 2023 growth forecasts on Tuesday to levels teetering on the brink of recession for many countries as the impact of central bank rate hikes intensifies.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.02 billion shares, compared with the 10.91 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 2.33-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.45-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted four new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 71 new highs and 30 new lows.

572,25,Microsoft,2023-01-11,Ex-Microsoft litigation leader joins law firm Morgan Lewis,"Summary

Summary Companies Former Microsoft VP adds to Morgan Lewis' new Seattle outpost

David Howard was previously a practice leader at Dechert















(Reuters) - David Howard, a former litigation and compliance leader at Microsoft Corp, has joined law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius as a partner, the firm said on Wednesday.

Howard, who was previously the software giant's corporate vice president and deputy general counsel for litigation, competition law and compliance, joins Morgan Lewis' new office in Seattle, where the firm launched last summer.

The Philadelphia-founded law firm entered Seattle with a 34-member team, including 14 lawyers from local litigation firm Calfo Eakes, which has since stopped operating. Howard called the Calfo Eakes team ""the finest boutique litigation practice in Seattle.""

Howard said he most recently worked on special projects for Microsoft after stepping down from the litigation chief role after he was diagnosed with stage-four cancer in 2018. He said he is now cancer-free.

Microsoft's current litigation head Jon Palmer said in a statement that Howard ""had an enormous positive impact"" and the company looks forward to working with him at Morgan Lewis.

Howard previously led the white collar and securities litigation practice at law firm Dechert before joining Microsoft in 2010 to lead the litigation team, oversee internal investigations and regulatory enforcement matters globally, the firm said. He also worked as a federal prosecutor and as an attorney on the White House Counsel's task force on the Iran/Contra matter.

Several other law firms have announced attorney hires from big technology companies this week.

Former Apple Inc chief privacy officer Jane Horvath joined law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, and Jamey Goldin, former energy regulatory counsel at Alphabet Inc's Google LLC, rejoined Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough. Kate Patchen, previously associate general counsel for competition at Meta Platforms Inc, started at Covington & Burling and Ryan Richardson, former lead global partnerships counsel at Stripe Inc, joined Davis Wright Tremaine.

While at Microsoft, Howard authored a blog post that made headlines in 2017, in which he said the technology giant planned to move more of its work with law firms to alternative fee arrangements, in a shift away from paying outside firms by the hour.

Without commenting on Microsoft's effort, Howard said he thinks ""there will be continuing discussions between companies and law firms about how best to pay for the value that firms bring to a particular engagement.""

573,631,Microsoft,2023-01-11,Wall Street ends sharply higher on optimism before key inflation report,"Summary

Summary Companies CPI report due Thursday before the bell

Bed, Bath & Beyond extends recent gains

Indexes: Dow up 0.8%, S&P 500 up 1.3%, Nasdaq up 1.8%















NEW YORK, Jan 11 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended up sharply on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq gaining more than 1% each as investors were optimistic ahead of an inflation report that could give the Federal Reserve room to dial back on its aggressive interest rate hikes.

The much-anticipated report due on Thursday is projected by economists polled by Reuters to show U.S. consumer prices grew 6.5% year-on-year in December, moderating from a 7.1% rise in November.

Among sectors, real estate (.SPLRCR) and consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) were the day's strongest performers, while Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and other mega-cap growth names gave the S&P 500 its biggest boost.

The benchmark index is up so far for 2023 after falling sharply last year. Hopes that the Fed could soon ease back on its aggressive tightening after raising the federal funds rate seven times in 2022 have boosted the market in recent sessions, even as comments by some Fed officials have supported the view that the central bank needs to remain vigilant about raising rates to fight inflation.

""Investors are anticipating that we're closer to a pause than at any other point last year,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He said that would be welcomed by the market.

Also, ""any time you have a down year, it's not surprising many times to have a reversal at the start of the new year,"" he said.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 268.91 points, or 0.8%, to 33,973.01, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 50.36 points, or 1.28%, to 3,969.61 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 189.04 points, or 1.76%, to 10,931.67.

Money market participants see a 75% chance the Fed will raise the benchmark rate by 25 basis points in February.

This week also marks the start of the fourth-quarter earnings season for S&P 500 companies, with overall S&P 500 earnings expected to have declined year-over-year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The biggest U.S. banks, which kick off the season later this week, are expected to report lower quarterly earnings as risks of a recession rise due to monetary policy tightening.

Goldman Sachs (GS.N) began laying off staff on Wednesday in a sweeping cost-cutting drive, a source familiar with the matter said. Shares of Goldman Sachs ended up 2%.

Retailer Bed Bath & Beyond Inc (BBBY.O) sharply extended recent gains to end up 68.6% despite bleak quarterly results, with some investors speculating it could be a potential acquisition target.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.42 billion shares, compared with the 11 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.78-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.25-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 98 new highs and 20 new lows.

574,42,Microsoft,2023-01-12,Microsoft wants gamers' Activision lawsuit paused pending FTC case,"Summary

Summary Law firms Tech company says freeze needed to avoid duplication

In private consumer case, video gamers challenge $69 bln deal















(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Wednesday asked a U.S. judge in California to pause a private antitrust lawsuit over the company's $69 billion bid to buy ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard Inc while a related U.S. regulatory action challenging the deal moves ahead.

Lawyers for Microsoft argued in a filing in San Francisco federal district court that freezing the private consumers' case would ""avoid needless and duplicative litigation and the risk of inconsistent rulings on identical issues.""

The consumer lawsuit on behalf of 10 video game players alleging Microsoft's purchase of Activision would reduce competition in the video game industry came about two weeks after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed its own case at the agency.

""There is accordingly no reason to litigate this case right now. Microsoft is already litigating the issues presented here in front of the FTC,"" Microsoft's lawyers at Wilkinson Stekloff and Alston & Bird told U.S. District Judge Jacqueline Corley.

The private case seeks a preliminary injunction blocking the purchase. The FTC has not yet filed any lawsuit in federal court. Its case is moving ahead in an administrative forum at the agency, where a judge has the power to enjoin the proposed tie-up. A hearing is scheduled for August.

Microsoft and its lawyers have defended the bid to buy Activision, saying the purchase would provide consumers ""high-quality content in more ways and at lower prices."" The deal also faces competition scrutiny in the EU and United Kingdom.

Lawyers for Microsoft in the California case did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.

A Microsoft spokesperson in a statement said ""since the claims raised in the private case are already being litigated by the FTC, it makes sense to pause this private litigation.""

Plaintiffs' attorney Joseph Saveri told Reuters that ""Microsoft hasn't provided any sound basis for stopping our case"" and that any halt to the litigation would run counter to what he said was a negotiated schedule letting the dispute move forward.

The FTC declined to comment.

In December, the agency said it sued to stop ""Microsoft from gaining control over a leading independent game studio."" The proposed merger would harm competition among rival gaming platforms from Nintendo Co Ltd and Sony Group Corp, the FTC said.

Microsoft said in Wednesday's filing in the private consumers' case that it and Activision have cooperated with the FTC and international counterparts to obtain regulatory approval for the deal.

Attorneys for Microsoft argued ""there is no risk of harm in staying plaintiffs' case while those regulatory proceedings are ongoing.""

The transaction agreement has a termination date of July 18.

The case is Demartini et al v. Microsoft Corp, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, 3:22-cv-08991-JSC.

For plaintiffs: Joseph Alioto of Alioto Law Firm and Joseph Saveri of Joseph Saveri Law Firm

For Microsoft: Rakesh Kilaru of Wilkinson Stekloff and Valarie Williams of Alston & Bird

575,647,Microsoft,2023-01-12,Wall St ends up as data suggests inflation may be on downward trend,"Summary

Summary Companies U.S. consumer prices fall in December

Quarterly results from big banks due Friday

Indexes: Dow up 0.6%, S&P 500 up 0.3%, Nasdaq up 0.6%















NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher on Thursday, extending recent gains as data showing a fall in consumer prices in December bolstered expectations of less aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.

U.S consumer prices fell for the first time in more than 2-1/2 years in December, the report showed, giving some hope that inflation was now on a sustained downward trend.

""Most investors are seeing inflation come down. That's a positive sign, and I would expect earnings to be decent,"" said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, Texas.

Friday brings results from a number of big U.S. banks, kicking off the start of the fourth-quarter earnings season for S&P 500 companies.

Trading was choppy following the CPI data. Rents remained very high in the report, while the labor market remains tight, and inflation is still well above the Fed's target.

A separate report on Thursday showed weekly jobless claims fell last week.

But some strategists said the slowdown in U.S. inflation may pave the way for the Fed to be able to bring down consumer prices without badly damaging growth.

Traders' bets of a 25-basis point rate hike by the Fed in February shot up to 91% after the data, from 77% previously.

Microsoft (MSFT.O) shares rose 1.2%, providing the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, while energy shares also were higher along with oil prices. Energy (.SPNY) rose 1.9% and was the day's best performer among sectors.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 216.96 points, or 0.64%, to 34,189.97, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 13.55 points, or 0.34%, to 3,983.16 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 69.43 points, or 0.64%, to 11,001.11.

Traders work on the trading floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., January 5, 2023. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly

The S&P 500 is now up 3.7% for the year so far.

""The (CPI) report confirms that inflation is in a downward trend and that it has reversed,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.

Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard acknowledged the moderation in prices, but stressed on the need for further monetary policy tightening to bring inflation down to the central bank's target.

The Fed raised the key rate by 50 basis points in December, after four back-to-back 75-bps hikes.

Big U.S. banks are forecast to report lower fourth-quarter profits, as lenders stockpile funds to prepare for an economic slowdown.

Also, overall S&P 500 earnings are expected to have declined year-over-year in the fourth quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, which would be the first quarterly U.S. earnings decline since 2020.

Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) shares ended near flat after Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, reported the carmaker has delayed plans to expand its Shanghai factory.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.14 billion shares, compared with the 10.88 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.75-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.50-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 14 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 96 new highs and 16 new lows.

576,823,Microsoft,2023-01-12,The SEC’s subpoena fight with Covington -- a 'perilous new course'?,"













(Reuters) - Every law firm in the United States ought to be paying attention to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit to force Covington & Burling to cough up the names of about 300 clients whose confidential information was exposed to hackers in a 2020 cyberattack.

Today it’s Covington that is stuck in what the firm portrays as an ethical conundrum. Tomorrow, if you have clients and a computer network, it might well be your firm that gets hit with an SEC subpoena for information that can be used against clients victimized by a hack of your files.

The SEC, as my colleague Andrew Goudsward reported on Wednesday, sued Covington in federal court in Washington, D.C., to enforce compliance with a subpoena the agency issued to the law firm last March, after SEC investigators learned that hackers from the Hafnium cyber-espionage group, which allegedly has ties to the Chinese government, exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft software to tap into Covington’s computer network.

It's not clear how the SEC found out about the hack. According to a white paper that Covington’s counsel from Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher presented to the SEC last June and that was filed as an exhibit to Wednesday's complaint, the law firm approached the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation within days of learning that its network had been breached. The firm, which believes cyber attackers were looking for information about China-related policies as President-elect Joe Biden prepared to take office, has said Covington coordinated with the FBI as it conducted its own internal investigation of the hack and alerted affected clients.

The FBI, according to Covington, did not ask the firm to reveal the identity of the clients whose files were exposed. But in March 2022, the SEC informed Covington that it was also investigating the hack.

The commission, according to Wednesday's lawsuit, said it needed to know more about Covington's affected clients in order to ascertain whether anyone used hacked information to engage in insider trading and whether Covington’s SEC-regulated clients adequately disclosed the cyberattack to their investors.

The SEC demanded that Covington disclose the identity of affected SEC-regulated clients; the information from clients’ files that Covington believed to have been illegally accessed; and the firm’s communications notifying clients of the attack.

Covington refused, prompting several months of negotiation. The SEC narrowed its demand to just the names of the 298 Covington clients that are regulated by the SEC and were affected by the hack. Covington would not agree, so the SEC sued.

The SEC contends that it needs the information in order to protect investors. As the agency explained in its complaint, it has previously brought enforcement actions against both public companies that botched the revelation of cyber attacks and traders who capitalized on non-public information obtained through illegal hacks. (In one instance – a case involving a former Equifax Inc executive – the SEC brought claims of insider trading based on the disclosure of a cyber attack.)

In an emailed statement on Thursday, SEC enforcement director Gurbir Grewal said the Covington subpoena is narrowly tailored and does not seek information shielded by attorney-client privilege. “Covington is the only source of this information, which is key to helping the SEC identify the hackers, any residual access and any violations of securities laws,” the statement said.

Covington, however, told the SEC in June that its duty of confidentiality precludes the firm from disclosing the identity of affected clients. During negotiations with the SEC, the firm asked affected clients if they would voluntarily reveal their identity to the agency. Only two -- of nearly 300 -- agreed.

“Covington has no discretion in this situation,” the firm insisted in its letter to the SEC. “It cannot comply with [SEC demands] under the current circumstances and still uphold its professional obligations to its clients.” (Covington maintains that its ethical duty to protect clients' confidences extends beyond the technical bounds of attorney-client privilege.)

Covington didn’t mention this consideration in the June letter, but there are potential financial consequences for a law firm that breaches its fiduciary duties to clients. What if Covington tells the SEC about a client it is not publicly known to represent and the SEC ends up bringing an enforcement action accusing the client of inadequate disclosures? The client might well try to blame Covington for prompting the SEC to investigate.

Covington counsel from Gibson Dunn have not yet formally responded to the SEC’s lawsuit, but based on the June letter, the firm will argue that there’s no precedent for the SEC to demand confidential information from a law firm unless either the firm or its client is already suspected of wrongdoing. Here, Covington contends, the SEC has no independent reason to investigate its clients but is simply engaged in what defense counsel Kevin Rosen of Gibson Dunn called a “fishing expedition.”

The agency’s “attempt to pry client confidences from an innocent law firm to assess whether any securities violations have taken place charts a perilous new course that threatens to chill the relationship between public companies and their counsel,” Covington argued.

Covington also told the SEC that its subpoena will end up hurting government efforts to identify cyber attackers. If law firms fear that they’re exposing their clients to SEC investigations by helping the FBI investigate hacks, they’ll “reevaluate that cooperation and transparency,” the letter said.

I reached out to the SEC to ask about Covington’s assertion that the subpoena is misguided as a matter of ethics and public policy but didn’t hear back.

Covington counsel Rosen emphasized the sweeping consequences of the case in a statement to me on Thursday. The SEC subpoena will “adversely affect incentives for clients and lawyers who now must navigate new layers of complexity and risk before they can assist criminal authorities as good citizens--an outcome that should concern other federal agencies as well,” Rosen said. “This action should concern every lawyer and every client whose confidences will be sought routinely by the SEC without any evidence of wrongdoing.”

Like I said: Pay attention.

Jan 17 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) plans to cut thousands of jobs with some roles expected to be eliminated in human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.

The expected layoffs would be the latest in the U.S. technology sector, where companies including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) have announced retrenchment exercises in response to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook.

Microsoft's move could indicate that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs.

""From a big picture perspective, another pending round of layoffs at Microsoft suggests the environment is not improving, and likely continues to worsen,"" Morningstar analyst Dan Romanoff said.

U.K broadcaster Sky News reported, citing sources, that Microsoft plans to cut about 5% of its workforce, or about 11,000 roles.

The company plans to cut jobs in a number of engineering divisions on Wednesday, Bloomberg News reported, according to a person familiar with the matter, while Insider reported that Microsoft could cut recruiting staff by as much as one-third.

The cuts will be significantly larger than other rounds in the past year, the Bloomberg report said.

Microsoft declined to comment on the reports.

The company had 221,000 full-time employees, including 122,000 in the United States and 99,000 internationally, as of June 30, according to filings.

Microsoft is under pressure to maintain growth rates at its cloud unit Azure, after several quarters of downturn in the personal computer market hurt Windows and devices sales.

It had said in July last year that a small number of roles had been eliminated. In October, news site Axios reported that Microsoft had laid off under 1,000 employees across several divisions.

Shares of Microsoft, which is set to report quarterly results on Jan. 24, were marginally higher in late afternoon trading.

578,396,Microsoft,2023-01-17,"Most British firms track race, ethnicity data but targets still lacking - study","Summary 72% of firms surveyed are collecting data

One in three has set goals, targets to improve

78% have yet to publish ethnicity pay gap results















LONDON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Nearly three-quarters of British firms are tracking race and ethnicity data, yet few have set targets to improve workplace equality or linked efforts to management pay, a survey by consulting firm Mercer showed on Tuesday.

Improving boardroom diversity has become a hot topic for policymakers and investors in recent years, as many believe it helps address social inequalities and leads to better corporate decision-making and performance over time.

A survey of 70 firms with a UK workforce of 65,000 and global headcount of more than 1 million people carried out in August showed more than half had felt pressure over the past two years to improve racial and ethnic diversity outcomes.

While 72% were collecting data, just over three-quarters were not publishing it and just one in three had set aspirational goals or targets to improve, Mercer said in the Overcoming Racial Inequities in UK Organisations Survey.

Of those employers to have set targets to improve, 69% had yet to link them to the short- or long-term incentive plan of leaders, it added.

On the issue of pay, 78% of those surveyed had not published ethnicity pay gap results, either internally or externally, Mercer said.

While investors are increasingly considering diversity metrics when assessing a company's management of environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks and opportunities, 16% of those surveyed said they saw no link between the two.

Of those that saw a connection to the 'social' pillar of ESG, 68% said they saw no connection to environmental or governance concerns.

""In practice, racial and ethnic equality should be a cornerstone of governance frameworks for policies, boards and metrics,"" the survey report said.

""If employers can begin to fully understand the relationship between ESG and racial and ethnic equality, this will help to move race and ethnicity up the agenda.""

579,537,Microsoft,2023-01-17,Davos 2023: What you need to know about the WEF on Tuesday,"













DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The first day of official programming at the World Economic Forum's (WEF) annual meeting kicked off on Tuesday with bold declarations by Europe and China in attempts to bolster their positions in the world.

The European Union will counter the U.S.'s game-changing Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), described in Davos as the most significant climate legislation since the 2015 Paris Agreement, with its own green deal.

European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would mobilize state aid and a sovereignty fund to keep firms from moving to the United States.

China, meanwhile, reopened its doors the world with a pitch to the global elite from Vice-Premier Liu He, who made it clear the country wants international investors to play a key role in Beijing's attempts to revive its slowing economy.

Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska told the WEF she would deliver a letter to Liu to pass on to Chinese President Xi Jinping that lays out President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's proposals for ending Russia's war against his country.

Liu's visit to Davos contrasts with the conspicuous absence of Russia, a key ally whose invasion of Ukraine China has refused to condemn.

As business and political leaders convened to address the cost of living and energy crises prompted by the war, Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin pledged her country's support to Ukraine as long as necessary.

U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said that time was running out for the world on climate change and he was not convinced it would get to a low carbon economy in time to save the most vulnerable people.

What was most needed, Kerry said, was ""money, money, money, money, money, money, money.""

The slopes continued to be dominated by discussions about Davos' hottest topic in 2023 - Chat GPT and generative AI.

Wide-ranging applications for the tech are being floated, from use as a programming assistant to a step forward in the global race for military supremacy.

In an announcement that coincided with the event, Microsoft said it plans to market ChatGPT to its cloud-computing customers.

Recession predictions once again permeated the frigid atmosphere. But the outlook was not all gloom and doom.

Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said U.S. consumers were in ""good shape"" as wages continue to grow.

580,49,Microsoft,2023-01-17,Microsoft to expand ChatGPT access as OpenAI investment rumors swirl,"













Jan 16 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Monday said it is widening access to hugely popular software from OpenAI, a startup it is backing whose futuristic ChatGPT chatbot has captivated Silicon Valley.

Microsoft said the startup's tech, which it so far has previewed to its cloud-computing customers in a program it called the Azure OpenAI Service, was now generally available, a distinction that's expected to bring a flood of new usage.

The news comes as Microsoft has looked at adding to the $1 billion stake in OpenAI it announced in 2019, two people familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. The news site Semafor reported earlier this month that Microsoft might invest $10 billion; Microsoft declined to comment on any potential deal.

Public interest in OpenAI surged following its November release of ChatGPT, a text-based chatbot that can draft prose, poetry or even computer code on command. ChatGPT is powered by generative artificial intelligence, which conjures new content after training on vast amounts of data -- tech that Microsoft is letting more customers apply to use.

ChatGPT itself, not just its underlying tech, will soon be available via Microsoft's cloud, it said in a blog post.

Microsoft said it is vetting customers' applications to mitigate potential abuse of the software, and its filters can screen for harmful content users might input or the tech might produce.

The business potential of such software has garnered massive venture-capital investment in startups producing it, at a time funding has otherwise dried up. Already, some companies have used the tech to create marketing content or demonstrate how it could negotiate a cable bill.

Microsoft said CarMax, KPMG and others were using its Azure OpenAI service. Its press release quoted an Al Jazeera vice president as saying the service could help the news organization summarize and translate content.

581,172,Microsoft,2023-01-17,Davos 2023: CEOs buzz about ChatGPT-style AI at World Economic Forum,"













DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Business titans trudging through Alpine snow can't stop talking about a chatbot from San Francisco.

Generative artificial intelligence, tech that can invent virtually any content someone can think up and type into a text box, is garnering not just venture investment in Silicon Valley but interest in Davos at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting this week.

Defining the category is ChatGPT, a chatbot that the startup called OpenAI released in November. The tech works by learning from vast amounts of data how to answer any prompt by a user in a human-like way, offering information like a search engine would or prose like an aspiring novelist.

Executives have floated wide-ranging applications for the nascent technology, from use as a programming assistant to a step forward in the global race for AI and military supremacy.

Conference goers with a major stake in the development of the technology include Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), whose chief executive, Satya Nadella, said the tech's progress has not been linear.

AI capabilities will ""completely transform"" all of Microsoft's products, he said in an on-stage interview with the Wall Street Journal.

Microsoft has a $1 billion investment in San Francisco-based OpenAI that it has looked at increasing, Reuters has reported. In an announcement that coincided with the conference, Microsoft said it plans to market ChatGPT to its cloud-computing customers. The company has also worked to add OpenAI's image-generation software to its Bing search engine in a new challenge to Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google.

Later on Tuesday, the political sphere gets to weigh in on the craze. French politician Jean-Noël Barrot planned to join a panel discussion with a Sony Group Corp (6758.T) executive on the technology's impact.

Matthew Prince, CEO of Cloudflare Inc (NET.N), a company that defends websites against cyberattacks and offers other cloud services, sees generative AI as good enough to be a junior programmer or a ""really good thought partner.""

In an interview, Prince said Cloudflare was using such technology to write code on its Workers platform. Cloudflare is also exploring how such tech can answer inquiries faster for its free-tier customers as well, he said on the annual meeting's sidelines.

Alex Karp, CEO of Palantir Technologies Inc (PLTR.N), a software provider helping governments visualise an army's movements or enterprises vet their supply chains, among other tasks, said such AI could have military applications.

Karp told Reuters in Davos, ""The idea that an autonomous thing could generate results is basically obviously useful for war.""

The country that advances the fastest in AI capabilities is ""going to define the law of the land,"" Karp said, adding that it was worth asking how tech would play a role in any conflict with China.

Businesses including CarMax Inc (KMX.N) have already used Microsoft and OpenAI's tech, such as to generate thousands of customer review summaries when marketing used vehicles. Proposed venture-capital investment has also exceeded what some startups want to take.

Such buzz carried through gatherings at Davos, like talk about a slide-generating bot dubbed ChatBCG after the management consulting firm. The service said on its website that it had too much demand to keep operating.

Law firms Related documents Caltech won now-vacated $1.1 bln award from Apple, Broadcom

Tech companies said they should be allowed to challenge patents















(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday asked for the Biden administration's views on Apple Inc and Broadcom Inc's bid to revive their challenges to patents owned by the California Institute of Technology, in a dispute in which Caltech previously won $1.1 billion in damages from the companies.

The justices asked for the U.S. solicitor general's input on a lower court decision that prevented Apple and Broadcom from arguing the patents were invalid at trial.

Caltech had no comment on the Supreme Court's order. Representatives Apple and Broadcom did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Caltech, located in Pasadena, California, sued Cupertino-based Apple and San Jose-based Broadcom in 2016 in federal court in Los Angeles, alleging that millions of iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and other devices with Broadcom Wi-Fi chips infringed its data-transmission patents.

A jury ruled for Caltech, ordering Apple to pay $837.8 million and Broadcom to pay $270.2 million. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit took issue with the amount of the award and sent the case back for a new trial on damages, which is set to begin in June.

Apple and Broadcom also told the Federal Circuit that they should have been allowed to challenge the patents' validity at trial. The patent-focused appeals court upheld the trial judge's decision to block the companies from making the arguments because they could have raised them in their petitions for U.S. Patent and Trademark Office review of the patents.

The companies appealed that decision to the Supreme Court last September. They told the justices that the Federal Circuit misread the law, which they said only bars arguments that could have been raised during the review itself, not in the petition.

Caltech has also sued Microsoft Corp, Samsung Electronics Co, Dell Technologies Inc and HP Inc, accusing them of infringing the same patents in separate cases that are still pending.

Apple is a major purchaser of Broadcom chips, and in January 2020 reached a $15 billion supply agreement with the company. Apple reportedly plans to replace Broadcom's chips with an in-house design in 2025.

Broadcom has estimated that 20% of its revenue comes from Apple.

The case is Apple Inc v. California Institute of Technology, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 22-203.

583,562,Microsoft,2023-01-18,Oil eases 1% as U.S. recession worries offset China recovery hopes,"Summary

Summary Companies China's reopening set to drive record 2023 oil demand -IEA

U.S. retail sales fell more than expected in December

Microsoft to eliminate 10,000 jobs, recession worries mount

Coming Up: U.S. oil stock data from API at 4:30 p.m. ET/2130 GMT















NEW YORK, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell about 1% on Wednesday, surrendering early gains as worries about a possible U.S. recession outweighed optimism that China's lifting of COVID-19 curbs will fuel demand for crude in the world's top oil importer.

Brent <LCOc1> futures fell 94 cents, or 1.1%, to settle at $84.98 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 70 cents, or 0.9%, to settle at 79.48.

The session high for both benchmarks was the highest since Dec. 5. For WTI, Wednesday was the first time in nine sessions that the contract settled down.

Oil prices reversed gains early in the afternoon along with Wall Street's main indexes (.DJI), (.SPX), (.IXIC) as hawkish comments from U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) officials sparked worries the central bank may not pause interest rate hikes any time soon.

Markets at first reacted positively to U.S. data, which showed retail sales and manufacturing production declined more than forecast in December, on hopes the Fed would now ease up on interest rate hikes.

However, the gains were short-lived as St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said rates needed to rise beyond 5% to control inflation.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said it would eliminate 10,000 jobs and take a $1.2-billion charge, as cloud-computing customers reassess spending and the company braces for potential recession.

""Coming on the back of the weakness in retail sales, the steep drop in industrial production and news of more job lay-offs adds to fears the U.S. could already be in recession,"" analysts at ING, a bank, told customers in a note.

Supporting oil prices early in the session, China reported economic data that beat forecasts after the country started rolling back its zero-COVID policy in early December.

China's lifting of restrictions should boost global oil demand to a record high this year, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), while price cap sanctions on Russia could dent supply.

Rystad Energy, a consultancy, said the effect of sanctions on Russian crude exports after 1.5 months of the European Union embargo and G7 price cap has not been as devastating as some predicted.

Rystad said the losses were at about 500,000 barrels per day and that India and China remain key buyers of Russian crude.

Analysts expect a drawdown in U.S. crude stocks of about 600,000 barrels last week, a Reuters poll showed, which could provide some price support. ,

The American Petroleum Institute (API) was set to release industry data at 4:30 p.m. EST (2130 GMT). The U.S. government reports at 11 a.m. on Thursday. Both weekly reports were delayed a day due to Monday's Martin Luther King Day federal holiday.

584,630,Microsoft,2023-01-18,Morning Bid: Japan hesitates,"













A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.

Judging by Wednesday's reaction, world markets reckon Japan will eventually abandon its ultra-loose monetary policy despite a stubborn doubling down this week - and overseas ructions may be less than feared.

After weeks of speculation, the Bank of Japan left its rock-bottom interest rates unchanged on Wednesday and kept its government bond yield cap at 0.5%, defying expectations it would phase out the stimulus programme as inflation builds.

But after some wild gyrations on the initial announcement, the market reaction was rather muted on balance.

The yen lunged lower to begin with, but then quickly rebounded. Dollar/yen settled back below 130 - roughly where it closed last Thursday - and remains down 1.2% for the year so far and down almost 15% since October.

Japan's Nikkei (.N225) ended 2.5% higher, but it closed before the yen rebound in European hours.

Japan's 10-year government bond yield crept back towards the 0.5% cap after an initial drop - indicating how the BOJ will likely have to continue buying hundreds of billions of dollars of bonds to retain the cap and how that is seen as unsustainable over time.

Investors now train their eyes on the exit of BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda in April as the point for a comprehensive shift.

Overseas fallout was even more subdued, with European stocks and Wall St futures little changed and U.S. Treasury yields hovering around 3.50%, where they've been for the past week.

Pressure on the dollar as attention turns back to the health of the U.S. economy, Federal Reserve speculation and the unfolding earnings season.

The release of December U.S. producer price, retail sales and industrial production numbers later on Wednesday now takes centre stage. A host of Fed speakers are also on the slate.

In corporate earnings, diverging fortunes within the investment banking world dominated on Tuesday.

Wall Street titans split as Morgan Stanley's stock surged (MS.N) on higher wealth management revenue while Goldman Sachs (GS.N) skidded lower as results revealed higher costs and an increase in rainy day funds.

Elsewhere, Microsoft (MSFT.O) plans to cut thousands of jobs with some roles expected to be eliminated in human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports.

Walt Disney (DIS.N) defended its decision to deny Nelson Peltz a board seat, saying the activist investor ""lacked the skills and experience"" to help the media and entertainment giant.

Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday:

* U.S. Dec producer price inflation, retail sales, industrial production, Jan NAHB housing market indicator, Nov business/retail inventories, Nov Treasury data on overseas holdings. Fed releases Beige Book on economic conditions. U.S. Treasury auctions 20-year bonds

* Bank of Japan policy decision. World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

* Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, St Louis Fed chief James Bullard, Dallas Fed chief Lorrie Logan, Philadelphia Fed chief Patrick Harker all speak

* U.S. corporate earnings: Alcoa, Charles Schwab, Discover, Kinder Morgan, Prologis, PNC, JB Hunt

Jan 18 (Reuters) - Keen to buttress margins and appease investor concerns at a time of slowing sales growth, big U.S. technology firms are expected to whittle away at their bloated workforce and costs through the next few months, reversing pandemic-era excesses, analysts said.

Each of America's five largest tech companies, though, are expected to report a fall in profits for the October-December period, as they try to recalibrate in a high-interest environment. Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) are expected to report the biggest declines.

Analysts have cut their total revenue projection for the five companies - Meta, Amazon, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) - by 5% to $561.4 billion as of January from October.

Big tech companies are expected to be among the biggest drags to S&P 500's eleven sectors, with the information technology sector projected to report an earnings decline of 9.5%, according to FactSet data.

""I would not expect good news for a while ... at least for the next three quarters. I would expect more layoffs,"" said Siddharth Singhai, chief investment officer at investment firm Ironhold Capital.

Amazon, which is expected to report that earnings slumped 38% and revenue grew at the slowest pace in over 22 years, started communicating to staff on Wednesday whether they were laid off as part of its decision to cut 18,000 jobs.

The reduction in workforce came after the retailer overhired based on pandemic demand, echoing Meta's aggressive hiring to meet a surge in social media usage by stuck-at-home consumers.

Meta, which decided in November to chop 11,000 jobs, could see a 42% plunge in profit, its fifth straight quarter of decline. The company is also likely to see a 7% fall in revenue - its worst showing ever.

The five companies on an average increased their employee base by 45% in 2020 and 20.5% in 2021, with Apple hiring the most modestly.

""We are forecasting another 5% to 10% headcount cut across the tech sector as many of these companies were spending money like 1980s rockstars,"" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.

Microsoft said on Wednesday it would eliminate 10,000 roles, affecting less than 5% of its employees. Analysts expect the company to report a 2.4% rise in revenue, the slowest pace in about 24 quarters. Profit is expected to fall 9%.

Apple's revenue is expected to fall for the first time in 15 quarters as its major supplier Foxconn (2317.TW) faced major disruption at the biggest iPhone factory in China due to worker unrest related to COVID curbs.

Revenue growth at Alphabet, which is slowing hiring and making ""course corrections"" to cut costs, is expected to be the slowest in 10 quarters.

To shore up stock prices, analysts said these companies could pour money into buybacks this year. Their shares fell between 26% and over 60% last year versus the broader market's nearly 20% decline.

They together have cash and cash equivalents of over $110 billion, with Amazon having the most and Meta having the least at the end of the September quarter.

Jan 18 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will cut some jobs in the United States, Canada and Costa Rica by the end of Wednesday as part of its plan to lay off 18,000 employees, the e-commerce giant said in a memo to staff seen by Reuters.

The layoffs are the latest in the U.S. technology sector, with companies cutting their bloated workforce and slashing costs to reverse pandemic-era excesses and prepare for a worsening global economy.

The company is terminating 2,300 employees in Seattle and Bellevue, according to an update on the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) site. The U.S. labor law requires companies planning a mass layoff to inform employees 60 days before the closure.

Amazon.com Chief Executive Andy Jassy said earlier this month the cuts, about 6% of the company's roughly 300,000 corporate employees, would mostly impact the e-commerce and human resources divisions. read more

587,59,Microsoft,2023-01-18,Video gamers fight Microsoft bid to block lawsuit over Activision deal,"Summary

Summary Law firms California federal court to consider pausing private suit

Microsoft says litigating in two forums raises duplication concern















(Reuters) - Video game players suing Microsoft Corp over its $69 billion bid to buy ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard Inc have asked a U.S. judge to deny the technology giant's effort to pause the consumer antitrust lawsuit pending the resolution of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's legal challenge to the deal.

The attorneys leading the case against Microsoft argued in a filing on Tuesday in California federal court that ""time is of the essence"" to challenge Microsoft's deal, which is set to close in July, and that the video game consumer plaintiffs are not parties to the FTC's case opposing the merger.

""If plaintiffs' case is stayed, there is a high likelihood that Microsoft will consummate the merger before plaintiffs can prove their claims,"" plaintiffs' lawyers Joseph Saveri and Joseph Alioto said in their filing. ""That result would not only irreparably harm plaintiffs but would also drastically complicate this proceeding and immeasurably expand its scope.""

The attorneys represent 10 video game players who argue the deal would harm competition, giving Microsoft ""far-outsized market power in the video game industry"" and the ability to foreclose rivals, limit output, reduce consumer choice, raise prices, and further inhibit competition.""

Lawyers for Microsoft at Wilkinson Stekloff and Alston & Bird on Wednesday did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. A representative from Microsoft declined to comment.

The FTC on Wednesday declined to comment.

Microsoft has defended its Activision acquisition plan, which also faces regulatory scrutiny in the EU and elsewhere, as a path ""to bring more games to more people.""

In a filing last week, Microsoft's lawyers argued that pausing the private litigation to allow the FTC case to move forward would ""avoid needless and duplicative litigation and the risk of inconsistent rulings on identical issues.""

The FTC, litigating at its in-house forum, hasn't asked a U.S. district court to preliminarily enjoin the deal. An administrative law judge still could block the acquisition.

""There is accordingly no reason to litigate this case right now. Microsoft is already litigating the issues presented here in front of the FTC,"" Microsoft's lawyers told U.S. District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley.

Alioto, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told Reuters that Microsoft had agreed to a timeline to move the private consumer case forward.

""The FTC and our case are separate. We're not governed by the FTC,"" Alioto said. He added: ""We don't wait for the FTC.""

The case is Demartini v. Microsoft Corp, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, 3:22-cv-08991.

For plaintiffs: Joseph Alioto of Alioto Law Firm; and Joseph Saveri of Joseph Saveri Law Firm

588,72,Microsoft,2023-01-18,"Microsoft to shed 10,000 jobs, adding to glut of tech layoffs","













DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Wednesday said it would eliminate 10,000 jobs and take a $1.2 billion charge to earnings, as its cloud-computing customers reassess their spending and the company braces for potential recession.

The layoffs add to the tens of thousands announced in recent months across the technology sector, which has downshifted following a strong growth period during the pandemic.

The news comes even as the software maker is set to ramp up spending in generative artificial intelligence that the industry sees as the new bright spot.

In a note to employees, CEO Satya Nadella attempted to address the divergent outlook for different parts of the business.

Customers wanted to ""optimize their digital spend to do more with less"" and ""exercise caution as some parts of the world are in a recession and other parts are anticipating one,"" he said. ""At the same time, the next major wave of computing is being born with advances in AI.""

Nadella said the layoffs, affecting less than 5% of Microsoft's workforce, would conclude by the end of March, with notifications beginning Wednesday.

However, Microsoft would keep hiring in ""strategic areas,"" he said. AI is likely to be one of those areas. Nadella this week touted AI to world leaders gathered in Davos, Switzerland, claiming the technology would transform its products and touch people around the globe.

Microsoft has looked at adding to its $1-billion stake in OpenAI, the startup behind the Silicon Valley chatbot sensation known as ChatGPT, which Microsoft plans to soon market through its cloud service.

Shares of the Redmond, Washington-based company ended 2% lower on Wednesday.

The announcement corresponds with the start of layoffs at its retail and cloud-computing rival Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), which started notifying employees Wednesday of its own 18,000-person job cuts.

In an internal memo seen by Reuters, Amazon said that affected workers in the United States, Canada and Costa Rica would be informed by the end of the day. Employees in China will be notified after the Chinese New Year.

Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) has announced cuts of 11,000 jobs, while cloud-based software company Salesforce Inc (CRM.N) said it would cut 10% of its 80,000-member workforce.

Overall, in 2022, more than 97,000 job cuts in tech were announced, the highest for the sector since 2002, when 131,000 cuts were announced, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

""We haven't seen this activity since the dot-com bust,"" said Andrew Challenger, the company's senior vice president.

Microsoft is terminating 878 full-time workers at its Redmond headquarters, according to an update on Washington State's Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) page. Under U.S. law, most employers are required to report staff cuts affecting 50 or more workers at a single location.

CLOUD GROWTH DECLINING

Microsoft's billion-dollar charge will cut profit by 12 cents a share in the company's second fiscal quarter this year, and could resonate beyond the tech sector, some analysts said.

""Here's one of the marquee growth companies with a very distinct user base saying that perhaps economic conditions aren't nearly as good as we thought they were,"" said Brian Frank, a portfolio manager at Frank Funds who has owned Microsoft stock on and off over the last several years.

The charge is attributable to severance costs as well as adjustments to Microsoft's hardware lineup and lease consolidation to build higher-density workspaces, Nadella said.

Microsoft declined to detail the hardware changes or say if it would stop developing any product line.

Microsoft's cloud revenues soared in recent years from an explosion in corporate demand to host data online and handle computing in the so-called cloud. But growth slowed to 35% in the first fiscal quarter of 2023, and the company projects more cooling to come. In July last year, it said a small number of roles had been eliminated.

589,438,Microsoft,2023-01-19,'Angry Birds' maker Rovio gets sweetened $738 mln offer from Playtika,"













Jan 19 (Reuters) - Playtika Holding Corp (8II.F), on Thursday sweetened its offer for Finnish game maker Rovio (ROVIO.HE), best known for its ""Angry Birds"" franchise, to 683 million euros ($737.50 million), as a consolidation in the industry gathers pace.

The offer values each share of Rovio at 9.05 euros, about 60% higher than the company's closing price on Jan. 19. It is also roughly 40 million euros above a previously undisclosed offer that Israel's Playtika made in November.

Espoo, Finland-based Rovio declined to comment. Its shares ended 2.5% lower at $5.67 in trading on the Finnish bourse before the offer was made public, while Playtika fell 2.6% in U.S. trading.

Rovio has had a tumultuous ride since going public in September 2017 at a price of $11.50 and the company's growth still remains overly dependent on the Angry Birds franchise despite efforts to diversify with acquisitions such as Turkish Ruby Games in 2021.

The game maker is also caught in a broader industry slowdown, especially in the mobile market, after two years of pandemic-driven boom.

Global mobile game revenues fell more than 6% to $92.2 billion in 2022, according to estimates from gaming analytics firm NewZoo.

The offer for Rovio is the latest sign of consolidation in the sector, with Microsoft (MSFT.O) in the process of buying Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) for $69 billion and Sony Interactive Entertainment (6758.T) purchasing ""Halo"" videogame creator Bungie Inc in a $3.6 billion deal.

Playtika, the maker of casino-style games and apps for poker and solitaire, had just last month said it would lay off 15% of its workforce. The company, whose shares halved in value last year, is also consolidating studios.

Summary Law firms

Law firms Related documents Seattle judge says IRS followed rules in FOIA lawsuits

Microsoft says it is cooperating in ongoing audit















(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Wednesday lost its bid in Seattle federal court to force the IRS to release tens of thousands of records tied to an audit that the agency is conducting of the technology company.

U.S. District Judge Ricardo Martinez in a pair of opinions ruled against Microsoft, after concluding in one lawsuit that the Internal Revenue Service was properly shielding 49,400 pages from disclosure under the federal Freedom of Information Act and in the other lawsuit that Microsoft was not entitled to additional records pertaining to the firm's audit-related contracts with law firms Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Boies Schiller Flexner.

Microsoft had accused the IRS of taking ""extraordinary lengths to keep its agency records in the dark"" and questioned ""outsourcing"" work to private law firms.

Martinez in both lawsuits said the IRS followed requirements under the public records law in responding to Microsoft's demand for documents.

""The court agrees with the IRS that they were reasonable and adequate under the circumstances of this case,"" Martinez wrote. ""Microsoft has failed to introduce evidence of bad faith or to otherwise demonstrate that the IRS's actions were unreasonable.""

The rulings were the latest chapter in a long clash between Microsoft and the IRS, whose audit of tax years 2004 to 2006 is ongoing, court records show. In his ruling, the judge said the ""ongoing audit will turn 16 this year — eligible for a driver’s license. If Microsoft owes back taxes, the money is old enough to vote.""

Attorneys for Microsoft at law firms Morgan, Lewis & Bockius and Baker & McKenzie on Thursday declined to comment.

Representatives from Boies Schiller and Quinn Emanuel did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

In a statement, a Microsoft spokesperson said, ""We respect the court's decision and will continue to cooperate with the IRS to resolve the underlying audit.""

An IRS spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft sued the IRS in Seattle in 2015 seeking records that included information about the agency's audit of Microsoft's ""transfer pricing"" covering Asia, Southeast Asia and South Pacific.

The IRS has looked at how technology companies account for the movement of goods and services across international lines.

U.S. Justice Department lawyers in court filings called the IRS audit of Microsoft ""one of the largest in the service's history.""

The IRS has released 91,900 pages in full, 13,000 pages in part. Among the withheld documents, the IRS said releasing more than 7,000 pages would interfere with enforcement proceedings.

In the law firm contracts lawsuit, the IRS released more than 337,000 and withheld 38,200 pages.

The agency also held back documents based on various legal privileges, including ""deliberative process,"" which can shield communication from agency officials about steps they are considering.

In his rulings, Martinez said that over seven years ""the parties have apparently engaged in good faith back and forth efforts to review and release these documents.""

The case is Microsoft Corp v IRS, U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington, No. 2:15-cv-01605-RSM and 2:15-cv-00369-RSM.

Summary

Summary Companies Weekly jobless claims fall 15,000 to 190,000

Continuing claims increase 17,000 to 1.647 million

Single-family housing starts rise 11.3%; permits fall 6.5%















WASHINGTON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, pointing to another month of solid job growth and continued labor market tightness despite efforts by the Federal Reserve to cool demand for workers.

The weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday likely does not change expectations that the U.S. central bank will further scale back the size of its interest rate increases next month. It, however, poured cold water on financial market hopes that the Fed would pause its fastest rate hiking cycle since the 1980s, which had been fanned by a slump in retail sales in December and a retreat in inflation.

""It is a frustrating reminder for the Fed that the labor market remains tight as employers hold onto workers,"" said Matthew Martin, a U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""We don't expect a spike in initial jobless claims even as the economy slows.""

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 190,000 for the week ended Jan. 14, the lowest level since September. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 214,000 claims for the latest week.

Part of the third straight weekly drop in claims likely reflected continuing challenges in adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations at the start of the year.

But through the seasonal volatility, claims have remained at levels consistent with a tight labor market even as layoffs have accelerated in the technology industry and interest rate-sensitive sectors like finance and housing.

Unadjusted claims dropped by 53,582 to 285,575 last week. There was a jump in claims for California, which were estimated, likely reflecting disruptions caused by recent severe weather in the state. That was offset by sizeable declines in Georgia, Michigan, New Jersey, Wisconsin, New York and Texas.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Wednesday it would eliminate 10,000 jobs, joining cloud-computing rival Amazon.com (AMZN.O), which is pushing ahead with a plan to lay off 18,000 employees.

Economists cautioned against reading the technology layoffs as flagging a deterioration in labor market conditions, arguing that these companies were right-sizing after over-hiring during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The tech sector is just getting back to where they were in 2020 or 2021, which I don't think is a bad situation,"" said John Blevins, a guest lecturer at Cornell University's SC Johnson College of Business. ""It's still a huge workforce.""

Outside the technology industry, economists say companies are generally reluctant to send workers home after difficulties finding labor during the pandemic. They expect companies to cut back on hiring before resorting to layoffs.

Indeed, the Fed's latest ""Beige Book"" report on Wednesday showed that ""many firms hesitated to lay off employees even as demand for their goods and services slowed and planned to reduce headcount through attrition if needed.""

Stocks on Wall Street fell. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.

MANUFACTURING SUBDUED

The Fed last year raised its policy rate by 425 basis points from near zero to the current 4.25%-4.50% range, the highest since late 2007. In December, it projected at least an additional 75 basis points of hikes in borrowing costs by the end of 2023.

Financial markets have priced in a 25-basis point rate increase at the Fed's Jan. 31-Feb. 1 meeting, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.

The claims data released on Thursday covered the period during which the government surveyed businesses for the nonfarm payrolls component of January's employment report.

Claims decreased between the December and January survey weeks. The economy added 223,000 jobs in December.

Data next week on the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, will shed more light on employment growth in January.

In the week ending Jan. 7, the so-called continuing claims rose 17,000 to 1.647 million, the claims report showed. That suggests some unemployed could be experiencing difficulties finding work. While the labor market continues to defy expectations, recession risks are rising.

A separate report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed single-family homebuilding rebounded in December, but permits for future construction dropped to more than a 2-1/2-year low, pointing to weakness ahead as tighter monetary policy strangles the housing market.

Housing starts and building permits

Single-family housing starts, which account for the bulk of homebuilding, increased 11.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 909,000 units last month, the highest level since August. Starts for housing projects with five units or more tumbled 18.9% to a rate of 463,000 units.

Single-family homebuilding increased in the Northeast, South and West, but fell in the Midwest. Overall housing starts decreased 1.4% to a rate of 1.382 million units last month. Homebuilding fell 3.0% in 2022.

Single-family building permits declined 6.5% to a rate of 730,000 units, the lowest level since April 2020. Outside the pandemic plunge, these permits were the lowest since February 2016. Building permits for housing projects with five units or more increased 7.1% to a rate of 555,000 units.

Though the single-family homebuilding backlog decreased to the lowest level since March 2021, the completions rate fell sharply. The inventory of single-family housing under construction rose modestly. Residential investment likely contracted for the seventh consecutive quarter, which would be the longest such stretch since the collapse of the housing bubble triggered the Great Recession.

News on manufacturing was equally gloomy. A survey from the Philadelphia Fed showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region remaining depressed this month. It added to reports this week showing manufacturing in New York state plunging in January to levels last seen in May 2020, and national factory production posting its biggest drop in nearly two years in December.

""The increasingly darkening cloud of weakening economic data has a silver lining, a persistently strong labor market,"" said José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers in Miami.

REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann















DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Global leaders and business executives departed a freezing World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting on Friday after a frank exchange of views over how the world will tackle its biggest issues in 2023.

Here's what we learned:

ECONOMY: Gloom and doom heading into Davos turned into cautious optimism by the end with the global economic outlook for the year ahead looking better than feared.

But the WEF's annual meeting was filled with discussion of plenty of risks, including inflationary pressures from China's reopening and rising debt distress in the developing world. Not to mention that the hardest bit for Western nations is yet to come - getting inflation down to 2%.

""Things are not great, but they are much better than they could have been."" - Daniel Pinto, JP Morgan's (JPM.N) president and chief operating officer.

UKRAINE: For Ukraine's allies, Davos was all about doubling down on better weapons and financial support for Kyiv to defend itself against Russia. Outside the West though, fears of an economic downturn highlighted global divisions as some delegates encouraged a quick return to the negotiating table.

""This week listening to the politicians, I was surprised in a way because I got the feeling that no-one really knows exactly where we are heading and what the solutions can be."" - Tanja Fajon Slovenia Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.

""If we want a negotiated peaceful solution tomorrow, we need to provide more weapons today."" - NATO Secret General Jens Stoltenberg.

TRADE: Be careful of friendshoring, warned the WTO's Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as the big three trading powers of the United States, Europe and China pushed their new industrial policies.

What was not clear was how the rest of the world fits in to new trade policies that protect workers and redefine supply chains.

""This becomes a rich-country game, right? We can subsidize this, you can subsidize that – what about the poor countries, who have limited fiscal room? They get left out in the cold."" -Raghuram Rajan, former governor of the Reserve Bank of India.

CLIMATE: The carbon crowd received a warm reception as the renewable industry rubbed shoulders with Big Oil executives. Awash with cash after a year of high oil prices, fossil fuel producers have the firepower to invest in green energy. But efforts on CEO green pledges and climate financing appeared sluggish.

On the outside, Greta Thunberg and activists called on the energy industry to stop hijacking the transition to clean power. On the inside, political leaders like Kier Starmer railed against new oil investments and Pakistani climate minister Sherry Rehman pushed for loss and damage funding.

""How do we get there? The lesson I have learned in the last years ... is money, money, money, money, money, money, money."" - U.S. climate envoy John Kerry on meeting the Paris Agreement's global warming target.

TECH: Davos juxtaposed the industry's potential and peril.

Just as Microsoft Corp's CEO and other Silicon Valley executives touted artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT to transform their businesses, they announced layoffs of tens of thousands of employees globally. Scrutiny of once high-flying cloud spending by businesses was at the forefront.

Businesses are ""under enormous cost pressure. They need to find ways to do the same things cheaper."" - Alex Karp, CEO of Palantir Technologies

CHINA: China declared itself open for business in a speech by Vice-Premier Liu He that was broadly welcomed but also raised inflationary fears and left people waiting to see what this would mean for existing tensions with the United States.

""The growth forecasts now for China is 4.5%. I would not personally be surprised when that would be topped."" - Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann.

INFLATION REDUCTION ACT: Dubbed a gamechanger for climate change by IEA head Fatih Birol, the Europeans had plenty to gripe about when it came to America's Inflation Reduction Act.

The European Union said it would mobilize state aid and a sovereignty fund to keep firms from moving to the United States.

""The key question is not China First, US First, Europe First. The key question for all of us is Climate First."" - French economy minister Bruno Le Maire.

FINANCIAL SERVICES: Global financial institutions are grappling with how to right-size for a slowdown, while dealing with a host of other headwinds. With the threat of inflation still hanging over central banks, financiers are facing demands from regulators for higher capital levels to prepare for a downturn, making some businesses unprofitable.

Pressure is also increasing on them to finance the global transition to a greener future much faster than they have been doing so far. Other exogenous events such as geopolitics and cybersecurity risks are further complicating matters. Consensus is elusive.

""We shall stay the course until such a time when we have moved into restrictive territory for long enough so that we can return inflation to 2% in a timely manner."" - Christine Lagarde.

593,24,Microsoft,2023-01-20,Microsoft loses bid to pause gamers' lawsuit over Activision deal,"Summary

Summary Law firms

Law firms Related documents U.S. judge sets March 23 preliminary injunction hearing on deal

Microsoft sought stay to ""simplify the issues""















(Reuters) - A U.S. judge in California on Thursday turned down Microsoft Corp's bid to freeze a private consumer antitrust lawsuit over the company's $69 billion deal to acquire ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard Inc while a related regulatory challenge to the deal plays out.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley in San Francisco comes after gamers opposed Microsoft's request to stay their case pending resolution of a Federal Trade Commission challenge in Washington, D.C.

The 10 plaintiffs argue, in claims similar to the FTC's, that the Activision deal would harm competition in the video game industry by reducing consumer choice and raising prices. The FTC has not asked a U.S. judge to enjoin the deal.

Corley said she will hear the gamers' bid on March 23 for a preliminary injunction to block Microsoft's proposed purchase of Activision.

Microsoft's leaders and attorneys for the company have called the deal beneficial to consumers. The proposal also faces antitrust scrutiny before the EU and UK.

""We remain confident in our case and path forward and are committed to closing the deal,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said on Thursday after the California court hearing.

Microsoft's lawyers at Wilkinson Stekloff and Alston & Bird had argued that allowing the private case to move ahead while the FTC dispute is ongoing could cause ""needless and duplicative litigation and the risk of inconsistent rulings"" on identical matters.

""Staying this case while the FTC litigation is ongoing would thus simplify the issues in this matter,"" Microsoft's attorneys told Corley.

The plaintiffs' attorneys, Joseph Saveri and Joseph Alioto, told the court that Microsoft previously had agreed to move the private case ahead even while the dispute at the FTC was pending. The gamers' lawyers also said they were not bound by the FTC proceeding.

Saveri told Reuters on Thursday that his team will focus on completing discovery.

Microsoft said in court on Thursday in California that it would not close the merger at least until March 31, according to Corley's order.

The plaintiffs' lawyers said there is no other private suit challenging the proposed deal.

The case is Demartini v. Microsoft Corp, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, 3:22-cv-08991.

For plaintiffs: Joseph Alioto of Alioto Law Firm; and Joseph Saveri of Joseph Saveri Law Firm

For Microsoft: Rakesh Kilaru of Wilkinson Stekloff, and Valarie Williams of Alston & Bird

594,179,Microsoft,2023-01-20,Breakingviews: Layoffs take Big Tech back to more modest future,"













NEW YORK, Jan 20 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Alphabet’s (GOOGL.O) plan to cut 12,000 jobs adds to the sense that U.S. technology firms are preparing for a more modest future. But it’s still grander than the not-so-distant past.

The Google parent joins rivals Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O), who are firing nearly 40,000 people between them. Tech firms based in the United States announced over 97,000 job cuts in 2022 according to consulting firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, the most since the dot-com crash. Over 80% of these occurred in the final three months of the year. Moreover, new job postings fell sharply at the end of 2022, according to trade group CompTIA.

Reuters Graphics

Even so, the pandemic bounty remains. There were 4.4 million people employed in tech in December, according to provisional figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s an all-time high, and over 440,000 more than in February 2020, the month before Covid-19 hit America. Alphabet, Microsoft, Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) and Amazon all said they are cutting about 5% of employees. If all tech firms did the same, that would leave employment at 4.2 million, or about 5% larger than it was at the end of 2019.

That seems about right. Tech revenue and employment can be volatile, but tends to grow faster than the economy at large. In the period from 2012 to the end of 2019, for example, America’s GDP grew 2.3% annually according to the Federal Reserve, while tech jobs increased at a rate of about 3%. For bosses like Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai or Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, who’d rather not retrench too much, cutting around 5% of staff is enough to show investors they’re serious about costs, without signaling an all-out retreat.

CONTEXT NEWS

Alphabet plans to eliminate about 12,000 jobs, according to a memo seen by Reuters on Jan. 20. That would reduce the workforce of the company that owns search engine Google by about 6%.

Microsoft said on Jan. 18 it would eliminate about 10,000 jobs, or about 5% of its staff. Amazon.com said on Jan. 5 it would cut 18,000 jobs. Meta Platforms said in November it would eliminate 11,000 jobs.

Technology firms based in the United States announced 97,000 job cuts in 2022 according to consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which is the most since 2002.

595,189,Microsoft,2023-01-20,Wall St Week Ahead Tech stock rebound faces doubters with earnings season ahead,"













NEW YORK, Jan 20 (Reuters) - A spate of earnings reports in coming weeks is set to test a recent bounce in technology and other megacap stocks, a category whose leadership position in U.S. markets has faltered after last year’s deep selloff.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index (.NDX) has gained nearly 6.2% in 2023, compared to a 3.45% rise for the S&P 500 (.SPX). Shares of some megacap companies - which include those grouped outside of tech in sectors like communication services and consumer discretionary - have shot higher, with Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta Platforms (META.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O) posting double-digit percentage increases.

Several factors are driving that outperformance, including investors piling into stocks they believe were overly punished in 2022. A moderation in bond yields, whose jump last year particularly pressured tech-stock valuations, is also likely helping the group, investors said.

Now, however, the focus is shifting to whether these companies can withstand a widely expected economic downturn while supporting valuations that some investors believe are too high.

""To keep this rebound going, the guidance for ’23 has to be less worse than what people are anticipating,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel, whose firm recently pared its holdings in Apple (AAPL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O).

Tech and growth stocks led U.S. equity markets for years following the 2008 financial crisis, aided by near-zero interest rates. They struggled along with broader markets last year as the Federal Reserve raised rates to fight surging inflation, and some investors doubt they will regain the market's pole position any time soon. The Nasdaq 100 fell 33% in 2022, while the S&P 500 lost 19.4%.

The top six stocks by market value in late 2021 - Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Amazon, Meta and Tesla (TSLA.O) - have seen their collective weight in the S&P 500 fall from 25% to 18%, according to Strategas Research Partners.

That dynamic echoes a pattern seen after the market’s dot-com bubble burst after the turn of the century. The six biggest stocks at that time saw their collective weight in the S&P 500 decline to 5% from a peak of 17% over a number of years, according to Strategas.

""This leadership unwind ... is going to be one that is measured in years, not in months or quarters,"" said Chris Verrone, head of technical and macro research at Strategas.

EARNINGS TEST

Companies comprising over half the S&P 500's market value are due to report results in the next two weeks, including Microsoft, the second-largest U.S. company by market value, on Tuesday, Elon Musk's Tesla and IBM (IBM.N) on Wednesday and Intel (INTC.O) on Thursday. Apple, the largest U.S. company by market value, and Google-parent Alphabet report the following week.

Fourth-quarter earnings in the tech sector are expected to have declined 9.1% from a year ago, compared to a 2.8% decline for S&P 500 earnings overall, according to Refinitiv IBES.

A critical question for many megacaps, once heralded for their stellar growth, is whether they can increase revenue and profits significantly while cutting costs in the face of a possible recession.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) said Friday it is cutting about 12,000 jobs, or 6% of its workforce, the latest tech giant to announce layoffs. Microsoft on Wednesday said it would eliminate 10,000 jobs while Amazon started notifying employees of its own 18,000-person job cuts.

""The biggest positive could be if they could show a control of expenses while keeping at least reasonable growth intact,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. ""It’s a hard balancing act.""

Valuations for tech and megacap companies have moderated after last year's selloff, though they still stand above those of the broader market. The S&P 500 tech sector still trades at a roughly 19% premium to the broader index, above its 7% average of the past 10 years, according to Refinitiv Datastream.

Nonetheless, some investors are reluctant to bet against tech stocks.

The Wells Fargo Investment Institute counts tech as one of its favored U.S. sectors.

The firm expects an economic downturn and believes many tech companies have businesses that are resilient to economic uncertainty, said Sameer Samana, a senior global market strategist there.

""It’s just too important and too big a weighting not to participate,"" Samana said. ""But the years of handily outperforming the S&P are probably now behind us.”

596,241,Microsoft,2023-01-20,"Alphabet cuts 12,000 jobs after pandemic hiring spree, refocuses on AI","













Jan 20 (Reuters) - Google's parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) is cutting about 12,000 jobs as it faces ""a different economic reality"", it said in a staff memo, doubling down on artificial intelligence (AI) and axing staff who support experimental projects.

The job cuts affect 6% of its workforce, and follows thousands of layoffs at tech giants including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) who are downsizing after a pandemic-led hiring spree left them flabby in a weak economy.

Shares in Mountain View, California-based Alphabet, which boosted its workforce by nearly a third through 2020 and 2021, rose 4% on Friday. They had fallen 30% in the past 12 months, echoing a 24% slump in the broader tech industry (.IXIC).

Sundar Pichai, Alphabet's boss since 2019, said in the memo on Friday that he took ""full responsibility"" for the decisions that led to the layoffs.

Pichai, whose pay was recently tied more closely to performance, said this was a moment to ""sharpen our focus, reengineer our cost base and direct our talent and capital to our highest priorities,"" as Alphabet looked to get imbue its products with more AI, echoing comments from Microsoft that announced job cuts on Wednesday.

Alphabet, long a leader in AI, is facing competition from Microsoft, which is reportedly looking to boost its stake in ChatGPT - a promising chatbot that answers queries with human-like responses.

Advertising dollars, Alphabet's mainstay revenue source, meanwhile, is feeling the squeeze from businesses chopping budgets as consumers pull back spending.

""It is clear that Alphabet is not immune from the tough economic backdrop, with worries about a U.S. recession growing,"" said Susannah Streeter, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

""Ad growth has come off the boil ... Competition is also heating up, with Alphabet facing a powerful rival in TikTok, and Instagram also vying for its important YouTube viewers,"" Streeter said, noting that Alphabet has also racked up billions in regulatory fines.

Evercore ISIS analyst Mark Mahaney said Alphabet's record-high headcount had created major margin risk going into fiscal 2023 and Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik said the job cuts could save the company Alphabet $2.5 billion to $3 billion in costs.

BIG JOB CUTS

With Alphabet's staff cuts, layoffs at four of the biggest U.S. tech companies total 51,000 jobs in the past few months. They have fanned fears of a recession even as the U.S. job market remains tight.

""The tech sector is bit like the proverbial canary in the coal mine,"" said Stuart Cole, an economist at Equiti Capital, who believes the tech layoffs portend that the outlook for job security is finally beginning to turn more negative.

Apple (AAPL.O), which hired more prudently through the pandemic, has held off on cuts so far. On Friday, though, website AppleInsider reported citing sources that the iPhone maker had started to lay off non-seasonal employees in its retail channel in places such as Best Buy (BBY.N) stores.

Apple was not immediately available for a comment on the report.

'LITTLE COMFORT'

Alphabet has been working on a major AI launch, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. One of the sources said it would take place in the spring. The New York Times also reported that Google planned to unveil more than 20 new products and a search engine including chatbot features.

Among those losing their jobs are recruiters, corporate staff and people working on engineering and product teams, Pichai said. Google has cut most jobs at Area 120, its in-house incubator for new projects, a company spokesperson told Reuters.

The Alphabet Workers Union said in a statement that the company's leadership taking ""full responsibility"" was ""little comfort.""

""It's appalling that our jobs are first on the chopping block so shareholders can see a few more points in a chart next quarter,"" the union said.

In the United States, where Alphabet has already emailed affected employees, staff would receive severance and six months of healthcare as well as immigration support.

Overseas, layoff notifications will take longer due to local employment laws and practices, Pichai said in the memo. Employees in Asia will learn starting in February if the reduction impacts them.

597,284,Microsoft,2023-01-20,India's Swiggy to lay off 380 employees - document,"













BENGALURU, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Food delivery platform Swiggy is planning to lay off 380 jobs, citing challenging macroeconomic conditions, according to an internal mail seen by Reuters on Friday, and joined a list of Indian startups that are shedding their workforce.

""The growth rate for food delivery has slowed down versus our projections (along with many peer companies globally. This meant that we needed to revisit our overall indirect costs to hit our profitability goals,"" Swiggy Chief Executive Officer and founder Harsha Majety told staff in the mail.

""We needed to right-size our overall personnel costs, also in line with the projections for the future. Our overhiring is a case of poor judgement,"" the mail added.

The food delivery startup, which has an employee strength of 6,000, operates in more than 500 cities.

Fears of an economic downturn prompted startups to slash thousands of jobs in recent months. Edtech startup Byju's, ride-hailing app Ola and video platform ShareChat also announced job cuts over the past six months.

Funding rounds backed by venture capital firms have also slowed down compared with a blockbuster 2021, according to Venture Intelligence.

Earlier this week, technology giants Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) said they would lay off 10,000 and 18,000 employees, respectively, while Meta announced its decision to cut 11,000 jobs.

Jan 19 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google is deferring a portion of its employees' year-end bonuses as part of a transition to a new performance management system, the search engine giant said on Thursday.

The company will pay 80% advance bonus to eligible employees initially and the remainder in later months, a spokesperson told Reuters, adding that the move was communicated to staff last year.

The development comes amid tech companies' attempts to limit spending amid a broader slowdown in demand and deteriorating economic conditions.

Alphabet has so far announced cuts impacting over 200 employees in its health sciences division even as its megacap peers Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) have let go thousands of employees.

The advance bonus will be paid in January and the remaining 20% in March or April, according to CNBC, which first reported the story. All bonuses next year onwards will be paid in March, the report added.

Google typically paid full bonuses in the first month of the year.

(This story has been corrected to remove the reference to bonus payments tied to quarterly costs in paragraph 5 after CNBC corrected its story)

Court says pausing Samsung case for USPTO challenges would prejudice university















(Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co failed to convince an East Texas federal court on Friday to pause the California Institute of Technology's high-stakes patent lawsuit against it while it challenges the patents' validity at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

U.S. District Judge Rodney Gilstrap said halting the lawsuit until the Patent Trial and Appeal Board reviews the patents would unnecessarily delay the court case and prejudice Caltech.

Caltech had no comment on the decision. Representatives for Samsung and Caltech did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Caltech sued Samsung after it won a $1.1 billion California jury verdict in 2020 against Apple and Broadcom in a dispute over some of the same patents. A U.S. appeals court tossed the verdict last year and remanded for a new trial on damages.

The school's 2021 lawsuit alleges Samsung's Galaxy phones, tablets, watches and Wi-Fi-enabled Samsung products like televisions and refrigerators infringe its data-transmission patents.

Caltech has separately sued Microsoft, Dell and HP over the patents. Samsung challenged their validity at the USPTO last year.

Samsung asked the Texas court to freeze Caltech's case against it until the reviews finish, arguing the lawsuit was at an early stage and the PTAB decisions would simplify the issues.

But Gilstrap said Friday that pausing the case would ""do nothing more than draw out the time to trial,"" and that he could not determine whether the PTAB challenges would simplify the lawsuit because the board had not yet decided whether to hear them.

Gilstrap also said a pause would ""require the parties to sink additional resources into the case,"" which has already been going on for over a year, ""all the while postponing Caltech's vindication of its patent rights.""

The Texas case is scheduled to go to trial in September. The board's final decisions on patent validity would be due in November.

The case is California Institute of Technology v. Samsung Electronics Co, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, No. 2:21-cv-00446.

Summary Companies Expects Q1 core earnings to be lower than last year

Expects to see effect of cost savings from Q2

Cost savings to include headcount reduction -CFO

Gross margin fell to 41.4% from 43.2%

Shares hit 2018 lows















STOCKHOLM, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Ericsson (ERICb.ST) on Friday reported lower than expected fourth-quarter core earnings as sales of 5G equipment slowed in high-margin markets such as the United States, sending the Swedish company's shares to their lowest since 2018.

Ericsson is the latest tech company to show the impact of customers tightening belts amid concerns about a global economic slowdown. Others have been cutting staff, including Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) which have announced thousands of job cuts this week.

Ericsson has already announced plans to cut costs by 9 billion crowns ($880 million) by the end of 2023.

Chief Financial Officer Carl Mellander told Reuters that would involve reducing consultants, real estate and also employee headcount.

""It's different from geography to geography, some are starting now, and we'll take it unit by unit, considering the labour laws of different countries,"" Mellander said, referring to the cuts.

He declined to say if the job cuts would be similar to 2017 when Ericsson laid off thousands of employees and focused on research to return the company to profitability.

Ericsson's shares were down as much as 8% early on Friday and were down 5.7% by 1206 GMT. They have fallen by about 40% since February last year following a U.S. investigation into potential payments by the company in Iraq.

Last week, the company said it would book a 2.3 billion Swedish crown ($220 million) provision for an expected fine from U.S. authorities for breach of a settlement reached in 2019.

U.S. IMPACT

Ericsson's net sales rose in the fourth quarter, but margins, net income and core earnings fell.

Its gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2022 fell to 41.4% from 43.2%.

Ericsson said it expected a fall in margin in its Networks business to persist through the first half of 2023 but the effect of cost savings to emerge in the second quarter.

JPMorgan analysts said given the fall in margins and higher investments, they would expect 2023 earnings to decline by a double digit percentage.

Inge Heydorn, partner and fund manager at investment firm GP Bullhound, said: ""The fourth quarter shows once again that the U.S. has a big impact on Ericsson's margins.""

With U.S. customers such as Verizon (VZ.N) tightening their purse strings, Ericsson is hoping newer markets such as India can provide some growth.

Its South East Asia, Oceania and India market was the only one to grow in the quarter, rising 21%, accounting for 13% of the company's business.

The company's fourth-quarter adjusted operating earnings, excluding restructuring charges, fell to 9.3 billion Swedish crowns from 12.8 billion a year earlier.

That was short of the 11.22 billion expected by analysts, Refinitiv Eikon data showed.

Net sales rose 21% to 86 billion crowns, beating estimates of 84.2 billion.

A settlement of a patent deal with Apple (AAPL.O) last month resulted in revenue of 6 billion crowns, but Ericsson also took 4 billion crowns in charges, including a provision for a potential fine from U.S. regulators and divestments.

Ericsson said it expects significant patent revenue growth over the coming 18-24 months.

601,714,Microsoft,2023-01-20,"Wall Street rallies to end higher on Alphabet, Netflix lift","Summary

Summary Companies Netflix co-founder Hastings steps down as CEO

Google parent Alphabet to lay off 12,000 workers

Goldman Sachs falls on report of probe

Dow up 1%, S&P 500 up 1.89%, Nasdaq up 2.66%















Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied to close higher on Friday, as the S&P 500 and Dow snapped a three-session losing streak and the Nasdaq rose more than 2%, as quarterly earnings helped lift Netflix, while Google parent Alphabet climbed after announcing job cuts.

Shares of Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) jumped 8.46% as the streaming company added more subscribers than expected in the fourth quarter and said co-founder Reed Hastings was stepping down as chief executive.

Netflix's quarterly report comes as the technology (.SPLRCT) and other growth-related sectors face hurdles due to the rising interest rate path of the U.S. Federal Reserve and recession worries that have led companies such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) to lay off thousands of employees.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) was the most recent company to announce job cuts as it said it was cutting 12,000 jobs, sending shares 5.34% higher.

The gains sent the communication services index (.SPLRCL) up 3.96% as the top performer among the 11 major S&P 500 sectors, notching its biggest daily percentage gain since Nov. 30.

High-growth sectors such as communication services were among the worst performing in 2022 and were notably weaker in the last few months of the year as investors gravitated towards stocks with high dividend yields.

""Today’s action is probably because we had three down days so it got into a little bit of an oversold position and they are just doing a little bit of bargain hunting today,"" said Ken Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors in Boca Raton, Florida.

""If people are viewing an opportunity, if they are getting more comfortable with the Fed’s narrative... investors are starting to buy into that narrative and saying 'OK that is the way it is, let’s look at the stocks that got really beaten up' because the market is a discounting mechanism.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 330.93 points, or 1%, to 33,375.49, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 73.76 points, or 1.89%, to 3,972.61 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 288.17 points, or 2.66%, to 11,140.43.

For the week, the Dow lost 2.7%, the S&P 500 shed 0.66% and the Nasdaq gained 0.55%.

Comments from Federal Reserve officials have largely said they expect interest rates to climb to at least 5% this year as the central bank continues to try and tamp down high inflation. On Friday, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said the central bank may be ""pretty close"" to a point where rates are ""sufficiently restrictive"" to cool inflation, which gave an additional boost to equities.

The Fed is largely expected to raise rates by 25 basis points (bps) at its Feb. 1 policy announcement.

Still, concerns about corporate earnings persist as the U.S. economy shows signs of a slowdown and a possible recession.

Analysts now expect year-over-year earnings from S&P 500 companies to decline 2.9% for the fourth quarter, according to Refinitiv data, compared with a 1.6% decline in the beginning of the year.

Gains on the Dow were curbed, however, by a 2.54% fall in shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) after the Wall Street Journal reported the Fed was probing the company's consumer business.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.90 billion shares, compared with the 10.87 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.55-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.63-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 77 new highs and 20 new lows.

602,759,Microsoft,2023-01-20,"Davos, Inc. finds reasons to be less gloomy","













DAVOS, Jan 20 (Reuters Breakingviews) - When the chairmen of some of the world’s largest companies got together behind closed doors at the World Economic Forum this week, they had plenty of reasons to feel sombre. Higher interest rates are putting a brake on economic growth, trade tensions are fracturing supply chains, and investors have just suffered their worst year since the 2008 financial crisis. Yet when the assembled crowd were asked how many of the companies represented had reported better profits last year, a majority raised their hands.

Call it the Davos paradox. The annual conflab in the Swiss mountains is synonymous with a model of globalised capitalism that is under attack from all sides. The WEF this year acknowledged those challenges, borrowing the trendy term “polycrisis” to describe the multi-dimensional dilemma posed by geopolitical confrontation, macroeconomic gyrations, and climate change. Multinationals from Microsoft (MSFT.O) to Goldman Sachs (GS.N) are cutting staff. And a large chunk of corporate chieftains seem pretty downbeat: of more than 4,000 chief executives consulted by PwC in October and November for a survey presented at Davos, 40% believe their company will no longer be economically viable in a decade’s time.

However, the captains of industry who travelled to Switzerland were less gloomy. “Things are not great, but they are much better than they could have been,” was how Daniel Pinto, JPMorgan’s (JPM.N) president and chief operating officer, summed up the prevailing state of mind.

There are three broad reasons to be more upbeat. First, China is ditching its Covid-19 controls at a much faster rate than anyone expected. Though the virus is now ripping through the population, leading to an increase in hospitalisations and deaths, the reopening should eventually boost the country’s growth rate. Analysts at Standard Chartered expect the world’s second-largest economy to expand by almost 6% this year, double the rate in 2022.

Second, Europe has managed to keep the lights on. The combination of a warm winter, lower industrial energy usage, and a rapid shift to alternative sources of energy means the continent avoided the potentially disastrous power cut that some feared after Russia invaded Ukraine 11 months ago.

Third, inflation is showing some signs of easing. Though consumer prices in the United States and the euro zone were respectively 6.5% and 9.2% higher in December than a year earlier, the increase was slightly lower than in previous months. As a result, investors have lowered their expectations for future interest rate hikes. Equities have recovered: the S&P 500 benchmark of leading stocks is up more than 5% in the past three months, boosting the paper wealth of many Davos executives and financiers. One prominent investor argued markets now offer more opportunities for buying what he calls QARP, or quality at a reasonable price.

Many executives now think the United States and Europe will suffer only a mild recession this year and may even avoid economic contraction. Companies typically cut back on investment in a downturn, but big groups have reasons to keep spending. For one, executives remain determined to make their supply chains more resilient by boosting manufacturing capacity in countries like India, Turkey and Mexico. They’re also eager to take advantage of generous U.S. subsidies, even as European politicians fret that the policies fuel protectionism.

Yet it’s worth remembering that Davos, Inc does not reflect the world economy. Most of the corporate chieftains shuttling between meeting rooms, cocktail parties and restaurants this week mostly lead global businesses whose geographical spread and access to capital markets better equips them to weather economic shocks. Small- and medium-sized enterprises, which have fewer such buffers, are barely represented. Many startups, perhaps seeking to conserve their precious reserves of venture capital cash, also stayed away.

Moreover, the enthusiasm could prove fleeting. U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration is heading for a showdown with Congress about raising the country’s debt ceiling. Higher interest rates will prove more painful as households deplete savings built up during the pandemic. Corporate results may disappoint: UBS analysts point out that consensus forecasts currently assume that companies in the S&P 500, excluding financial and energy firms, will expand their profit margins this year. That seems unlikely at a time when wage, energy and interest costs are all rising. New military conflicts remain an enduring threat.

The Davos conflab has a well-deserved reputation for delivering a consensus which turns out to be wrong in the 12 months that follow. In January 2020, delegates barely registered the risk of a pandemic which shut down the global economy a few weeks later. As they head back down the mountain, the alpine elites may find that their improved mood does not last long.

603,322,Microsoft,2023-01-20,"Furniture retailer Wayfair to cut 1,750 jobs to save costs","













Jan 20 (Reuters) - Online furniture retailer Wayfair Inc (W.N) said on Friday it will cut 1,750 jobs, or 10% of its workforce, in a cost-saving drive at a time when persistently high inflation has pressured consumer spending.

The news sent its shares as much as 26% higher to an over four-month high of $48.94 amid broader market gains.

The Boston-based retailer joins a growing list of U.S. companies - from tech giants such as Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to home goods retailer Bed Bath & Beyond Inc (BBBY.O) - that have slashed their workforce and reined in spending to ride out the economic downturn.

On Friday, Wayfair said the job cuts will affect 18% of its corporate workforce, or about 1,200 employees. The company said in August it will cut 870 jobs.

It had previously outlined a $1.4 billion cost-saving plan to scale down on operating costs amid weakening demand for its furnishings. Including the August workforce reduction, the company said on Friday the labor portion of the plan represents about $750 million in savings.

""It's a move in the right direction to realign the company's cost structure for today's environment,"" said senior analyst Anna Andreeva from Needham & Co Inc, adding that Wayfair is becoming more flexible and agile.

The Wall Street Journal first reported the layoffs on Thursday.

Wayfair had 16,681 full-time equivalent employees as of Dec. 31, 2021, according to a regulatory filing.

604,783,Microsoft,2023-01-20,Take Five: Staring at the ceiling,"













Jan 20 (Reuters) - The world's largest economy hitting its debt limit is fraying confidence, just as some of the biggest names in the U.S. corporate landscape get ready to report results.

Global business activity data will provide the latest insight into how protracted a slowdown could prove, Britain's FTSE flirts with record highs and Japan, New Zealand and Australia release inflation numbers.

Here's a look at the week ahead in markets from Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, Lewis Krauskopf and Ira Iosebashvili in New York, and Naomi Rovnick and Alun John in London.

1/HITTING THE CEILING

The U.S. government hit its $31.4 trillion borrowing limit amid a spat between the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and President Joe Biden's Democrats over raising the country’s debt ceiling - a standoff that could lead to a fiscal crisis, or at worst a default within months.

Immediate fallout might be limited, but risks will emerge closer to June, when the government approaches the date beyond which the Treasury will likely have exhausted emergency manoeuvres to stave off default.

Legislative fights over the limit this last decade have largely been resolved before they hurt markets. But a lengthy standoff in 2011 prompted S&P to downgrade the U.S. credit rating for the first time.

U.S. credit default swaps - an instrument used to insure against default - have hit decade highs in recent days.

2/ THE BOTTOM LINE

Results from the megacap tech and growth companies will test the nascent new year's rebound in tech shares.

Microsoft (MSFT.O), the second biggest U.S. company by market value, reports on Tuesday followed by Elon Musk's Tesla (TSLA.O) on Wednesday - and that's just the warm up for Apple, the top U.S. firm and Google-parent Alphabet the week after. All told, companies worth more than half the S&P 500's market value are reporting results over the next two weeks.

Earnings season has had a tepid start. S&P 500 companies are expected to post an overall 2.6% drop in Q4 earnings versus the year-ago period, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

Other market-moving catalysts could come from economic data, including new home sales on Thursday and the personal consumption expenditures index on Friday.

3/SUNNIER SKIES OR FALSE DAWNS?

Could this be the end of bear market rallies? Global stocks remain nearly 20% below their January 2022 record high. But MSCI's global share index is also on its longest winning streak since the depths of the bear market last October, as traders bet on economic conditions improving.

All eyes will be on purchasing managers indexes summarising executives' views of the business climate, to see if the global economy really is heading somewhere less gloomy.

The JPMorgan Global Composite PMI in December lingered below the 50 benchmark separating expansion from contraction. It was also, at 48.2, a few ticks above November's 29-month low.

Stock markets can predict the global PMI levels, tending to bounce ahead of a sustainable rise of the index. Improvements in PMI readings from developed economies will likely increase risk appetite. Another downturn may cause the bears to roar again.

4/INFLATION VS DOVES

The Bank of Japan just sent a strong signal to the bond market: stop betting that the end of stimulus is near.

But data could fuel market speculation. Inflation renewed a more than four-decade high nationwide last month, and double the BOJ's 2% target. January figures for Tokyo could push even higher when they're released on Jan. 27.

While Japanese government bond yields remain subdued following the BOJ's unanimous decision to keep the status quo on Wednesday, currency markets tell a different story. The yen retraced most of its big, knee-jerk drop on the same day of the decision, and is hovering near seven-month highs.

On Wednesday, watch out for Australian and New Zealand inflation data as well, with the RBNZ pondering how much more to tighten, and the RBA wondering whether it's time to pause.

5/LONDON CALLING

London's bluechip FTSE 100 index (.FTSE) is poised to launch a new attempt to scale an all-time high in days to come.

The rally is a sign, at least in part, that the so-called ""moron premium"" which weighed on British assets after the political turmoil of autumn 2022 is easing.

That's not the only thing helping the index outperform peers - its heavy weighting of miners and other commodity-focused stocks has received a boost from China's reopening.

The fact it is only just about to match its May 2018 record reflects the FTSE's weakness in recent years: The S&P 500 (.SPX) hit its record top in January 2022 and is currently 40% above May 2018 levels.

British public sector borrowing numbers, producer price inflation and PMI data are all due as well ahead of a Bank of England meeting the following week.

Underperforming FTSE slowly catches up

Jan 23 (Reuters) - Slower cloud spending by inflation-hit businesses is expected to stall the sales momentum at Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and add to the troubles of the sector that laid off thousands this month.

After years of blistering growth, most recently fuelled by remote working and studying during the pandemic, cloud demand has cooled in the past nine months and sales growth may slow further, analysts said.

Reuters Graphics

End-user cloud spending for services including those from the world's largest providers - Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft's Azure - is expected to grow 20.7% this year after 18.8% growth in 2022 and 52.8% in 2021, according to research firm Gartner.

""A lot of companies are slowing their migration to the cloud or asking for a lower price on their existing plans,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria said.

Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said last week that businesses were exercising caution as ""some parts of the world are in a recession and other parts are anticipating one"".

THE CONTEXT

Azure is set to grow 31% in the December quarter, according to Visible Alpha, its weakest growth since the Redmond, Washington-based company started breaking out the unit's numbers in 2015.

AWS, Amazon's lucrative cloud business from which it gets more than a quarter of its revenue, is expected to post a 24% increase in sales in the quarter. It grew 28% in the July-September period.

The slowdown is also expected to weigh on Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), the third-largest cloud provider, a sign that the overall market was maturing, analysts said.

Reuters Graphics

""Easy to move"" workloads are already on the cloud and it will be harder for providers to encourage businesses to move the next batch of workloads to their platforms, brokerage UBS said earlier this month.

Microsoft has also taken a hit from a slump in the personal computer market, where its Windows software is still the dominant operating system. Amazon, too, is feeling the heat from slowing retail demand.

THE FUNDAMENTALS

* Microsoft Q2 revenue is expected to rise 2.5% to $53 billion, the slowest increase in six years.

* Amazon Q4 revenue is expected to rise 5.8% to $145.40 billion.

WALL STREET SENTIMENT

* 47 of 53 analysts rate Microsoft's stock ""buy"" or higher, and have a median price target of $285.

* Microsoft shares have fallen 19% in the past 12 months.

* 48 of 52 analysts rate Amazon's stock as ""buy"" or higher, and have a median price target of $135.

* Amazon shares have fallen 32% in the past 12 months.

606,35,Microsoft,2023-01-23,Microsoft to invest more in OpenAI as tech race heats up,"[1/2] A Microsoft logo is seen on an office building in New York City, U.S. on July 28, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Segar















Jan 23 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Monday announced a further multibillion dollar investment in OpenAI, deepening ties with the startup behind the chatbot sensation ChatGPT and setting the stage for more competition with rival Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google.

Recently touting a revolution in artificial intelligence (AI), Microsoft is building on a bet it made on OpenAI nearly four years ago, when it dedicated $1 billion for the startup co-founded by Elon Musk and investor Sam Altman.

It has since built a supercomputer to power OpenAI's technology, among other forms of support.

Microsoft in a blog post has now announced ""the third phase"" of its partnership ""through a multiyear, multibillion dollar investment"" including additional supercomputer development and cloud-computing support for OpenAI.

Both companies will be able to commercialize the AI tech that results, the blog post said.

A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment on the terms of the latest investment, which some media outlets earlier reported would be $10 billion.

Microsoft is committing even more resources to keep the two companies at the forefront of artificial intelligence via so-called generative AI, technology that can learn from data how to create virtually any type of content simply from a text prompt.

OpenAI's ChatGPT, which produces prose or poetry on command, is the prime example that last year gained widespread attention in Silicon Valley.

Microsoft last week said it aimed to imbue such AI into all its products, as OpenAI continues to pursue the creation of human-like intelligence for machines.

Microsoft has started adding OpenAI's tech to its search engine Bing, which for the first time in years is being discussed as a potential rival to Google, the industry leader.

The widely anticipated investment shows how Microsoft is locked in competition with Google, the inventor of key AI research that is planning its own unveil for this spring, a person familiar with the matter previously told Reuters.

Microsoft's bet comes days after it and Alphabet each announced layoffs of 10,000 or more workers. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft warned of a recession and growing scrutiny of digital spend by customers in its layoff announcement.

607,456,Microsoft,2023-01-23,Spotify to trim 6% of workforce in latest tech layoffs,"













Jan 23 (Reuters) - Spotify Technology SA (SPOT.N) said on Monday it plans to cut 6% of its workforce and would take a related charge of up to nearly $50 million, adding to the massive layoffs in the technology sector in preparation for a possible recession.

The tech industry is facing a demand downturn after two years of pandemic-powered growth during which it had hired aggressively. That has led firms from Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) to Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to shed thousands of jobs.

""Over the last few months we've made a considerable effort to rein in costs, but it simply hasn't been enough,"" Chief Executive Daniel Elk said in a blog post announcing the roughly 600 job cuts.

""I was too ambitious in investing ahead of our revenue growth,"" he added, echoing a sentiment voiced by other tech bosses in recent months.

Spotify's operating expenditure grew at twice the speed of its revenue last year as the audio-streaming company aggressively poured money into its podcast business, which is more attractive for advertisers due to higher engagement levels.

At the same time, businesses pulled back on ad spending on the platform, mirroring a trend seen at Meta and Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), as rapid interest rate hikes and the fallout from the Russia-Ukraine war pressured the economy.

The company, whose shares rose 5.8% to $103.55, is now restructuring itself in a bid to cut costs and adjust to the deteriorating economic picture.

It said Dawn Ostroff, the head of content and advertising, was leaving after an over four-year stint at the company. Ostroff helped shape Spotify's podcast business and guided it through backlash around Joe Rogan's show for allegedly spreading misinformation about COVID-19.

The company said it is appointing Alex Norström, head of the freemium business, and research and development boss Gustav Söderström as co-presidents.

Spotify had about 9,800 full-time employees as of Sept. 30.

608,503,Microsoft,2023-01-23,Morning Bid: Euro rising,"













SYDNEY, Jan 23 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Wayne Cole.

It's been a quiet start to the week in Asia with much of the region on holiday. U.S. stocks futures are near flat, but EUROSTOXX futures added 0.5% to extend their recent bullish run.

Presumably much of that is due to the 60% drop in European gas prices since December and relief that the worst fears of an energy crunch have not come about, even if it has turned a bit colder in recent days.

Analysts assume the same sea change will deliver an improvement in the EU flash PMIs for January this week, likely outperforming the U.S. surveys.

This has combined with some hawkish words from ECB Governing Council member Knot to lift the euro to a fresh nine-month high at $1.0903 and challenge the April spike top at $1.0936.

Knot is considered a card-carrying member of the ECB hawk club, which was clearly irked by recent reports that the central bank might step down to quarter-point hikes in March.

The latest Reuters poll of analysts tips hikes of 50 basis points in both February and March and a peak of 3.25%, while the Fed is now thought certain to go by 25 basis points next week. read more

Minutes on Monday of the Bank of Japan's December meeting, where they shocked markets by widening the yield curve band, were striking in how dovish board members still were. The move really was aimed at dysfunction in the bond market and was not a flag of future tightening or dropping YCC altogether.

Members were keen that the BOJ explain to markets that the change was not a step toward an exit from policy easing, something it clearly failed at in the official statement.

Indeed, most of the discussion was about the importance of maintaining stimulus, a stance Governor Kuroda repeated more forcibly after last week's meeting.

Going by all this, if YCC is to change it will likely be under the new governor in April, and it is not clear the whole board would agree with it.

Key developments that could influence markets on Monday:

- ECB's Lagarde and Panetta are appearing

- No major economic data due on Monday. Around a quarter of the S&P 500 report this week starting with Microsoft on Tuesday.

609,176,Microsoft,2023-01-23,Spotify to cut staff as soon as this week - Bloomberg News,"













Jan 22 (Reuters) - Spotify Technology (SPOT.N) is planning layoffs as soon as this week to cut costs, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday, joining the likes of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) who have cut thousands of jobs recently.

The report, which cited sources, said that the number of jobs being eliminated was not specified.

Spotify did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.

Tech firms shed jobs last year as a demand boom during the pandemic rapidly fizzled, and layoffs have continued this year with companies looking to rein in costs to ride out the economic downturn.

In the last few weeks, Google parent Alphabet said it would eliminate 12,000 jobs, while Microsoft said it would eliminate 10,000. Amazon's layoff round will impact more than 18,000 roles.

Other tech companies like Facebook-parent Meta and Elon Musk's Twitter laid off thousands late last year.

610,564,Microsoft,2023-01-23,Morning bid: Who let the hawks out?,"













A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Dhara Ranasinghe.

The U.S. Federal Reserve has entered its black-out period before next week's meeting, data is thin and much of Asia is shut for the Lunar New Year holiday. It's a good opportunity for policy hawks at the European Central Bank to get their message across.

The ECB is likely to raise interest rates by 50 basis points in February and March and will continue to increase rates in the months after, ECB governing council member Klaas Knot said at the weekend.

ECB chief Christine Lagarde meanwhile has reiterated the central bank will keep raising rates at a brisk pace to bring inflation down to its 2% target.

Lagarde is scheduled to speak later in the day.

Currency traders are getting the hint -- they've pushed the euro to nine-month highs above $1.09 on Monday, with the single currency last up over 0.5% on the day and set for a fourth straight month of gains .

If data this week from the euro area, such as the first snapshot of business activity (January PMIs) proves better than expected, the euro could soon touch $1.10, some analysts reckon.

That's not bad going for a currency that was languishing at two-decade lows around $0.95 in September.

Euro at nine-month highs vs dollar

The Bank of Canada, meanwhile, is expected to hike interest rates by 25 bps on Wednesday. A pause in its aggressive rate rises was anticipated just a few weeks ago, but strong data has prompted markets to price another move this week.

Canada's central bank has raised its benchmark interest rate at a record pace of 400 bps in nine months to 4.25%, and said after its last increase that a decision to raise rates further would be more data-dependent.

Trade in U.S. stock futures suggested a flat open for Wall Street , , although the signals from other major stock markets boded well for U.S. trading later on.

Japan's blue-chip Nikkei stock index rallied just over 1.3% (.N225) and European shares (.STOXX) were pushed higher by technology and mining shares, while bank stocks were boosted by the hawkish ECB talk.

Earnings season remains in the spotlight, with Microsoft, Blackstone and Boeing among those scheduled to report earnings this week.

Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Monday:

- Goldman Sachs to cut asset management investments that weighed on earnings

- Japan warns of dire finances as BOA struggles to contain yields

- POLL-European Central Bank to raise deposit rate to 3.25% by mid-year

Activist investor Elliott Management takes stake in Salesforce

Chips surge on Barclay's upgrade

Indexes up: Dow 0.76%, S&P 1.19%, Nasdaq 2.01%















NEW YORK, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Wall Street closed sharply higher on Monday, fueled by surging technology stocks as investors began an earnings-heavy week with a renewed enthusiasm for market-leading momentum stocks that were battered last year.

All three major stock indexes extended Friday's gains, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq leading the pack, boosted by semiconductor shares (.SOX).

""(Chips are) a group that's been depressed, so I’m not too surprised,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""We're going to see earnings from these companies over the next couple of weeks and that will be where the rubber meets the road.""

""It’s a group that was ripe for a rebound.""

The session marks a calm before the storm in a week jam-packed with high profile earnings reports and back-end loaded with crucial economic data.

Investors are all but certain the Federal Reserve will implement a bite-sized interest rate hike next week even as the U.S. central bank remains committed to taming the hottest inflationary cycle in decades.

""(Investors) are pretty comfortable that they’re going to see lower rate hikes from the Fed, that we are rounding the corner on inflation and interest rate hikes,"" Tuz added. ""Stocks can do well in that environment, especially the big growth stocks that drive the market.""

Financial markets have priced in a 99.9% likelihood of a 25 basis point hike to the Fed funds target rate at the conclusion of its two-day monetary policy meeting next Wednesday, according to CME's FedWatch tool.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 254.07 points, or 0.76%, to 33,629.56, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 47.2 points, or 1.19%, to 4,019.81 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 223.98 points, or 2.01%, to 11,364.41.

Of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors, all but energy (.SPNY) ended green, with tech shares (.SPLRCT) enjoying the largest percentage gain, up 2.3% on the session.

The fourth-quarter reporting season has shifted into overdrive, with 57 of the companies in the S&P 500 having posted results. Of those, 63% have delivered better-than-expected earnings, according to Refinitiv.

Analysts now see S&P 500 fourth-quarter earnings, on aggregate, dropping 3% year-on-year, nearly twice as steep as the 1.6% annual drop seen at the beginning of the year, per Refinitiv.

This week, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Tesla Inc , along with a spate of heavy-hitting industrials including Boeing CO (BA.N), 3M Co (MMM.N), Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N), Dow Inc (DOW.N), and Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N), are expected to post quarterly results.

The Philadelphia SE semiconductor index (.SOX) jumped 5.0%, its biggest one-day gain since Nov. 30 after Barclays upgraded the sector to ""overweight"" from ""equal weight.""

Tesla surged 7.7% after Chief Executive Elon Musk took the stand in his fraud trial related to a tweet saying he had backing to take the electric automaker private.

Baker Hughes Co (BKR.O) missed quarterly profit estimates due to inflation pressures and ongoing disruptions due to Russia's war on Ukraine. The oilfield services company's shares dipped 1.5%.

Cloud-based software firm Salesforce Inc (CRM.N) jumped 3.1% following news that activist investor Elliot Management Corp has taken a multi-billion dollar stake in the company.

Spotify Technology SA (SPOT.N) joined the growing list of tech-related companies to announce impending job cuts, shedding 6% of its workforce as rising interest rates and the looming possibility of recession continue to pressure growth stocks. The music streaming company's shares rose 2.1%.

On the economic front, the U.S. Commerce Department is expected to unveil its initial ""advance"" take on fourth-quarter GDP on Thursday, which analysts expect to land at 2.5%.

On Friday, the wide-ranging personal consumption expenditures (PCE) report is due to shed light on consumer spending, income growth, and crucially, inflation.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.73-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 19 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.99 billion shares, compared with the 10.62 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

Microsoft gains in extended trading after posting results

Indexes: Dow up 0.31%, S&P 500 off 0.07%, Nasdaq down 0.27%















NEW YORK, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended nominally lower on Tuesday at the close of a rocky session marked by a raft of mixed earnings and a technical malfunction at the opening bell.

A spate of NYSE-listed stocks were halted at the top of the session due to an apparent technical malfunction, which caused initial price confusion and prompted an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

More than 80 stocks were affected by the glitch, which caused wide swings in opening prices in dozens of stocks, including Walmart Inc (WMT.N) and Nike Inc (NKE.N).

""Everybody’s having computer problems, first the airlines and now it’s the NYSE,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist Ingalls & Snyder in New York. ""Seems like it was quickly corrected.""

""Some of the prints were clearly bad,"" Ghriskey added. ""It was a surprise. Unexpected.""

The Nasdaq joined the S&P 500 in negative territory, while the Dow ended modestly higher.

Fourth quarter earnings season is in full swing, with 72 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 65% have beaten consensus, just a hair below the 66% long-term average, according to Refinitiv.

On aggregate, analysts now expect S&P 500 earnings 2.9% below the year-ago quarter, down from the 1.6% year-on-year decline seen on Jan. 1, per Refinitiv.

""The Fed will take apart earnings reports and look at how the economy is doing, given the rate hikes and other issues out there,"" Ghriskey said. ""We’re getting closer to that point where the Fed sees enough progress in the inflation fight to stop the (interest) rate hikes and that’s why the markets have reacted positively lately.""

Economic data showed shallower-than-expected contraction in the manufacturing and services sector in the first weeks of the year, suggesting that the Federal Reserve's restrictive interest rates are dampening demand.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 104.4 points, or 0.31%, to 33,733.96, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 2.86 points, or 0.07%, to 4,016.95 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 30.14 points, or 0.27%, to 11,334.27.

Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, industrials suffered the biggest loss.

Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N), owner of the New York Stock Exchange, dropped 2.2% as SEC investigators searched for the cause of Tuesday's opening bell confusion.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) shares dipped 2.1% after the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Google for abusing its dominance of the digital advertising business.

Industrial conglomerates 3M Co (MMM.N) and General Electric Co (GE.N) both provided underwhelming forward guidance due to inflationary headwinds.

3M's shares lost 6.2% while General Electric's rose 1.2%.

Aerospace/defense companies Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and Raytheon Technologies Corp (RTX.N) were a study in contrasts, with the former issuing a disappointing profit forecast and the latter beating estimates on solid travel demand.

Lockheed Martin and Raytheon were up 1.8% and 3.3%, respectively.

Railroad operator Union Pacific Corp missed profit estimates as labor shortages and severe weather delayed shipments. Its shares shed 3.3%.

Microsoft (MSFT.O) gained more than 4% in extended trading after narrowly missing quarterly revenue estimates.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 26 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 77 new highs and 22 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.58 billion shares, compared with the 10.61 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

613,525,Microsoft,2023-01-24,Morning Bid: It's all about the weather,"













A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Wayne Cole.

It's been another quiet session in Asia with many markets still on holiday. Japan was open and the BOJ's dogged defence of Yield Curve Control seems to be working with 10-year yields holding around 0.39% and away from the 0.5% ceiling.

Notably, the BOJ's new 1 trillion yen ($7.7 billion) offer of five-year funds on Monday drew bids for three times as much, suggesting this could prove a useful method of injecting added liquidity into the market. Essentially banks could borrow at an average 0.145% fixed for five years to invest in JGBs - what could go wrong?

With spreads widening against the yen, the USD has gained 1.7% in the past two sessions and stands around 130.30, while the AUD is up over 3% as an old favourite of the carry trade.

The euro hasn't been able to regain its $1.0927 top but did find support at $1.0850. Bulls are hoping the flash S&P global surveys on Tuesday will confirm the EU economy is currently faring better than the United States, in a reversal of fortunes.

The EU manufacturing PMI is seen edging up to 48.5 in early January from 47.8, and services to 50.2 from 49.8, reflecting in part sharply lower gas prices and the relatively warm winter so far.

JPMorgan is forecasting NWE gas storage will be 56% full at the end of winter, nearly 30%-points higher than the five-year average and a drag on prices.

The U.S. manufacturing PMI is forecast to dip to 46.0 from 46.2, with services at 45.0 from 44.7. Ironically, the weather in the States in recent weeks has been a lot worse than in Europe, which was not how this story was supposed to pan out.

Elsewhere, U.S. stock futures have been becalmed in Asia after rallying overnight. Nasdaq futures gained 2% led by semiconductor and other tech stocks, with some suggesting the recent run of job layoffs in the sector represents a new focus on cutting costs and lifting profits.

Microsoft reports after the bell with the focus on how its cloud and enterprise units are doing, though its reported $10 billion investment in OpenAI is likely to get more column inches in the media. Others reporting include Johnson & Johnson, Verizon and Texas Instruments.

Key developments that could influence markets on Tuesday:

- ECB head Lagarde speaks, but a video message at a roundtable on ""The euro as a guarantee of resilience"" doesn't sound exactly market moving.

Summary Companies Legal personnel head Casey Ryan will succeed global managing partner Sandy Thomas

Thomas, who has held the role since 2013, leaves for nonprofit KIND















(Reuters) - Law firm Reed Smith said Tuesday that its global managing partner and executive committee chair Alexander (Sandy) Thomas is stepping down for a new job at a nonprofit, sparking the first top leadership change at the firm in a decade.

Thomas, who has helmed the Pittsburgh-founded global firm since 2013, will depart effective March 1 for a role as the first chief legal officer of Washington, D.C.-based nongovernmental organization Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), the firm said.

Reed Smith's executive committee has appointed Catherine (Casey) Ryan, who is currently the firm's global head of legal personnel, to succeed Thomas.

""Over the past decade, it has been a privilege to lead Reed Smith's global team, a group of exceptionally talented lawyers and professional staff,"" Thomas said in a statement.

Thomas said he has ""gained a deep appreciation of KIND's global mission"" through Reed Smith's pro bono work for the organization. The nonprofit, founded by Microsoft Corp and Angelina Jolie, offers pro bono legal representation for refugee and migrant children, according to its website.

Thomas and Ryan were not immediately available for additional comment.

Reed Smith, which has about 1,500 lawyers globally, said it increased its annual revenue from $1.152 billion in 2014 to $1.436 billion in 2021 under Thomas' leadership. That places it among the top 30 U.S. law firms by gross revenue, according to figures reported by The American Lawyer.

Thomas oversaw the firm's expansion into new legal markets, including this week in Orange County, the firm said, bringing its count to 31 offices globally.

His departure comes as several other major U.S. law firms have announced a leadership shakeup in recent months, including Seyfarth Shaw, Dechert, Jones Day, Dentons and Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath.

Summary

Summary Companies Dow 0.3%, S&P -0.1%, Nasdaq -0.3%

Microsoft beats estimates in closely watched results

Corporate bellwethers report mixed results

U.S. business activity contracts















NEW YORK/LONDON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes closed mixed and the dollar slid a bit on Tuesday after companies warned of a tough year ahead along with some profit beats, while data showed U.S. business activity contracted for a troubling seventh straight month in January.

S&P Global's Flash U.S. Composite Output Index last month rose to 46.6, below a reading of 50 where growth begins. Companies reported soft demand amid still high inflation that remains a headwind to customer spending, the report showed.

Real GDP growth is likely to turn negative in the first half of 2023, said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank in Dallas, in a note.

""The economy still might dodge a recession,"" he wrote. ""But the many financial and economic indicators economists use to forecast business-cycle turning points suggest that a recession is more likely near term.""

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed slightly lower after bellwethers including 3M (MMM.N), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), Verizon (VZ.N) and GE (GE.N) reported mixed results. The Dow rose as Traveler Cos (TRV.N), American Express (AXP.N) and JPMorgan Chase provided almost half its gains.

After the market closed, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) posted better-than-expected quarterly profit as a revenue jump at its cloud services unit helped offset a slump in the personal computer market, sending its shares 4% higher in after-hours trade.

""What really is going to define whether the Nasdaq is going to continue to do well this year is how the earnings outlook looks, with Microsoft starting today,"" said King Lip, chief investment strategist at BakerAvenue Wealth Management in San Francisco.

Up to Monday the Nasdaq had gained almost 10% this year due to declining interest rates and a rebound after significant declines last year, Lip said.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 0.31%, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 0.07% and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 0.27%.

Earlier in Europe, S&P Global data for the euro zone reinforced expectations the European Central Bank (ECB) will raise rates by a further 50 basis points on Feb. 2, a day after the Fed is expected to have raised rates by 25 basis points.

Euro zone business activity made a surprise return to growth in January, according to the S&P Global survey - the latest sign that the downturn in the bloc may not be as deep as feared.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index (.STOXX) closed down 0.24%.

Overnight, Japan's Nikkei (.N225) closed at a more than one-month high, recovering all its losses since the Bank of Japan's surprise policy tweak last month. Many Asian markets remained closed for the Lunar New Year.

MSCI's all-country world index (.MIWD00000PUS) gained 0.04% to eke out a fresh five-month closing high.

The euro was flat at $1.0885, holding near a nine-month high supported by expectations the ECB can continue to raise rates to curb inflation, without worrying too much about damaging growth.

Treasury yields were mostly lower in choppy trading as investors looked ahead to next week's Fed policy meeting.

The yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell 6.8 basis points to 3.455%.

Germany's 10-year yield was steady at 2.157%.

Crude oil prices slipped on concerns about a global economic slowdown and an expected build in U.S. oil inventories.

U.S. crude futures fell $1.49 to settle at $80.13 a barrel, while Brent settled down $2.06 at $86.13.

Gold prices pulled back from a nine-month high due to a slight uptick in the dollar and U.S. bond yields, though hopes of slower Fed rate hikes underpinned the market.

U.S. gold futures settled up 0.4% at $1,935.40 an ounce.

616,214,Microsoft,2023-01-24,"Nvidia CEO says AI will need regulation, social norms","













STOCKHOLM, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang on Tuesday said that the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence will create powerful tools that require legal regulation and social norms that have yet to be worked out.

Huang is one of the most prominent figures in artificial intelligence because Nvidia's chips are widely used in the field, including in a supercomputer that Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) built for startup OpenAI, in which Microsoft said Monday it was making a multibillion-dollar investment.

Huang was speaking at an event in Stockholm, where officials said Tuesday they were upgrading Sweden's fastest supercomputer using tools from Nvidia to, among other things, develop what is known as a large language model that will be fluent in Swedish.

""Remember, if you take a step back and think about all of the things in life that are either convenient, enabling or wonderful for society, it also has probably some potential harm,"" Huang said.

Lawmakers such as Ted Lieu, a Democratic from California in the U.S. House of Representatives, have called for the creation of a U.S. federal agency that would regulate AI. In an opinion piece in the New York Times on Monday, Lieu argued that systems such as facial recognition used by law enforcement agencies possibly can misidentify innocent people from minority groups.

Huang said engineering standards bodies would need to establish standards for building safe AI systems, similar to how medical bodies set rules for the safe practice of medicine. But he also said laws and social norms would play a key role for AI.

""What is the social norm for using it? What the legal norms (are) for using it have to be developed,"" Huang said. ""Everything is evolving right now. The fact that we're all talking about it puts us in a much better place to eventually end up at a good place.""

617,190,Microsoft,2023-01-24,Alphabet-owned AI firm DeepMind shutters office in Canada's Edmonton,"













Jan 24 (Reuters) - DeepMind Technologies, owned by Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), is closing its office in the Canadian city of Edmonton, a spokesperson for the AI firm said, just days after Google's parent announced it would lay off 12,000 employees.

London-based DeepMind's Edmonton office is the only international site directly managed by the artificial intelligence firm, making it far more resource-intensive to operate, the spokesperson said. All other DeepMind sites are housed within Google-managed offices.

Alphabet's layoffs follow thousands of layoffs at tech giants including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), which are cutting costs and downsizing after a pandemic-led hiring spree left them flabby in a weak economy.

Researchers have been offered the option to relocate to another DeepMind office, such as DeepMind Montreal, based in Google’s Montreal office, the spokesperson added.

Google acquired DeepMind in 2014, putting the tech giant ahead in the AI race than most of its peers. But competition escalated after Microsoft-backed OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT boosted investor interest in the promise of generative artificial intelligence.

""I am confident about the huge opportunity in front of us thanks to the strength of our mission, the value of our products and services, and our early investments in AI,"" Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said in the blog post on Jan. 20.

618,188,Microsoft,2023-01-24,"Morning bid: Tech tonic, recession rethink","













A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.

Pumped-up hopes for U.S. tech sector earnings in a heavy week for corporate updates generally have twinned with the latest sign Europe may have dodged a winter recession.

With Microsoft (MSFT.O) topping the U.S. company reports on Tuesday and Tesla (TSLA.O) due later this week, Monday's impressive Wall St <S&P500> rally was driven by a combination of chip sector ebullience and confidence the Federal Reserve will dial down the size of its interest rate hikes again next week.

Philadelphia SE semiconductor index (.SOX) jumped 5% on Monday as analysts upgraded the industry, making it the biggest one-day gain since November. The S&P500 jumped 1.2% and futures held nearly all those gains ahead of busy Tuesday.

With Microsoft in view, attention will be on the extent for cost cutting and job shedding in the tech and digital space. Music-streamer Spotify (SPOT.N) rose 2% on Monday as it joined a growing list of tech firms to announce staff cuts, shedding 6% of its workforce.

Reports of Ford's F.N plan to cut 3,200 workers in Europe shows job attrition may not be confined to tech sector.

But Microsoft stock gained too on Monday too after it announced another multibillion dollar investment in OpenAI, deepening ties with the startup behind the chatbot sensation ChatGPT.

Tesla jumped 7.7 % ahead of its earnings on Wednesday and as Chief Executive Elon Musk took the stand in a fraud trial related to tweets saying he had backed taking the electric automaker private.

After a year of conflict in Ukraine and military tensions surrounding Taiwan, 2022's outperforming U.S. defence stocks will also grab the spotlight on Tuesday as Lockheed Martin and Raytheon report fourth quarter figures.

More broadly, the latest earnings season is still expected to show decline of about 3% over the previous year for S&P500 firms overall - even though beats are slightly ahead of forecast so far.

Even though net downgrades to U.S. 2023 earnings outlooks still dominate and the expected growth rate has halved again to just 2.4% since early November, the fact it's still positive despite widespread recession fears is remarkable.

Whether that's just too rosy and markets have yet to price a full-blown earnings recession is this year's big question.

But hopes for the fabled 'soft landing' persist - with the Fed likely to downsize rate hikes to just 25 basis points, China's economy reopening and a relatively warm winter and falling energy prices helping the euro zone skirt recession.

Euro zone business surveys for January showed the composite reading for both manufacturing and service sector activity back in expansion mode again for the first time since June.

Whether that's good news for markets or a signal that the European Central Bank will have to stamp even harder to get double digit inflation back to target is a moot point.

Equivalent U.S. business soundings for this month are due out later.

With China's markets closed for the new year holiday, Japan's shares outperformed as long-term borrowing rates fell back further there. Europe's stocks were little changed.

The euro was a little lower, but the dollar was broadly unchanged overall and U.S. Treasury yields were a touch easier.

Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday:

* January business surveys for the United States and from around the world. U.S. Jan Richmond Fed manufacturing index, Philadelphia Fed's non-manufacturing business survey.

* European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, Dutch central bank chief Klaus Knot both speak. Bank of England Executive Director for Financial Stability Strategy and Risk Sarah Breeden speaks

* U.S. corp earnings: Microsoft, Texas Instruments, Verizon, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, General Electric, Halliburton, Union Pacific, Johnson & Johnson, Danaher, 3M, Capital One, Invesco, Travelers, DR Horton, Paccar, F5, Intuitive Surgical.

619,159,Microsoft,2023-01-24,Microsoft’s revenue sniffles are tech’s flu,"













NEW YORK, Jan 24 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Microsoft’s (MSFT.O) revenue growth rarely falters. So its 2% increase in the latest quarter, the slowest in over five years, is alarming. Customers who overinvested during the pandemic are now retrenching, even on Microsoft’s staples. It’s a poor omen for firms built on more discretionary offerings.

The astonishing $1.8 trillion valuation Microsoft sports has a lot to do with how fast, and consistently, it has grown since going public in 1986. Its rolling four-quarter growth has only gone negative twice: once after the Great Recession in 2009 and later when Chief Executive Satya Nadella switched the firm toward subscriptions, which temporarily hit revenue.

Sure, the top line still reached $52.7 billion in the quarter. Microsoft’s productivity software remains standard among office workers. Moreover, companies continue to move more data and applications to Microsoft’s cloud. Its Azure platform grew 31%, a trend that ought to be sustainable for a while yet.

One glitch is that companies, and consumers, invested a lot in technology in recent years in order to work from home. This pulled forward some spending, lowering current growth. Sales of personal computers spiked during the pandemic, but users are unlikely to be buying replacements soon since the typical device lasts several years. Fourth-quarter shipments fell nearly 30%according to market researcher Gartner, the largest decline it has ever recorded. Microsoft’s revenue from computer manufacturers for installing the Windows operating system fell 39%.

More broadly, employers are worried about a slowing, or shrinking, economy. Tech firms in particular are firing significant chunks of their workforce to rein in costs. Fewer office workers mean fewer Microsoft subscriptions. And companies looking to cut costs will delay, or kill, IT projects, which will hit even Microsoft’s fastest-growing units. Azure’s growth was 15 percentage points higher a year ago.

Microsoft’s revenue sniffles, however, probably signal bigger problems for tech firms that sell less essential goods to consumers and firms. If staples like Windows are feeling the chill, advertising budgets, shiny new phones, and telecom gear will be too. Companies like Meta Platforms (META.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) may be in line for a nasty bout of top-line flu.

CONTEXT NEWS

Microsoft said on Jan. 24 that revenue for the quarter ending Dec. 31 was $52.7 billion. The 2% increase from the same period last year is the slowest quarterly growth for the software giant since June 2017.

Microsoft earned $16.4 billion, or $2.20 per share during the quarter, compared to $18.8 billion, or $2.48 per share in the same period a year ago.

Jan 24 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) posted results on Tuesday that showed some strength in the face of a weak economy, buttressed by a cloud business that hit Wall Street targets for the end of 2022, but it may miss expectations in the current quarter.

The relatively stable outlook helped assuage fears that the lucrative cloud segment for big tech companies could be hit hard as customers look to cut spending, and cloud revenue in the fiscal second quarter reported on Tuesday made up for some weakness in the PC unit.

“The small miss on Microsoft’s cloud earnings forecast is likely just a reflection of the new economic reality that businesses are facing and not a harbinger of something worse,"" said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research.

Microsoft's shares rose 4% initially after the results before reversing course to slip 1% to $239.58 in after-hours trade. The stock has fallen 18% in the past 12 months.

Microsoft joined other big tech companies in turning to layoffs to ride out harder times, announcing last week it was cutting over 10,000 jobs. It posted fiscal second-quarter earnings exceeding Wall Street's estimate.

It forecast third-quarter revenue in its so-called intelligent cloud business would be $21.7 billion to $22 billion, just below the analyst average forecast of $22.14 billion, according to Refinitiv. In the second quarter revenue from that segment beat expectations slightly at $21.5 billion.

The cloud business is under the spotlight again following the viral success of chatbot ChatGPT, which answers general questions in plain language using artificial intelligence. The bot is a creation of startup OpenAI, in which Microsoft is investing heavily and which requires intense cloud computing services.

""There's a variety of ways that we can bring that technology either in specific offerings or to improve existing offerings,"" said Brett Iversen, Microsoft's head of investor relations, referring to OpenAI. He said revenue from OpenAI-related businesses would show up in revenue for Microsoft's cloud service Azure in the future.

During the earnings call, Chief Executive Satya Nadella said it was too early to separate out AI contribution from the Azure cloud workloads.

Azure cloud product revenue in the second quarter rose 31%, in line with estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. It has steadily grabbed market share from leader Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Azure ended 2022 with 30% share in the cloud computing market, up from 20% in 2018, according to estimates from BofA Global Research. AWS dropped to 55% from 71% during the same period.

Microsoft's revenue rose 2% to $52.7 billion in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with the average analyst estimate of $52.94 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES. Net income fell 12% to $16.4 billion, but adjusted income of $2.32 per share topped Wall Street's consensus estimate of $2.29, according to Refinitiv calculations.

Sales at Microsoft's More Personal Computing segment, which includes Windows, devices and search revenue, declined 19% to $14.2 billion as the PC market continued to shrink. The company expects that revenue to drop to $11.9 billion to $12.3 billion in the current fiscal third quarter.

FTSE 100 down 0.2%, FTSE 250 off 0.3%















Jan 25 (Reuters) - The UK's main stock indexes closed in the red on Wednesday, retreating after an upbeat start to the day as a bleak outlook from technology bellwether Microsoft hit sentiment, while Ascential surged on a positive full-year forecast.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 (.FTSE) eased 0.2% to a two-week low and the midcap FTSE 250 index (.FTMC) fell 0.3%.

Pessimism spilt over from Wall Street after Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) warned that growth in its lucrative cloud business could stall, hitting tech stocks globally.

""If someone like Microsoft is really suffering, with a cautious outlook, plus all those layoffs that are still coming through, it is enough to dampen down any appetite to push this rally further,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group.

While the UK's main equity indexes kicked off 2023 on an upbeat note with the FTSE 100 flirting with record levels, worries about Britain's gloomy economic outlook and further interest rate rises have weighed on sentiment since.

Money markets are expecting a 77.1% chance of a 50 basis point hike from the Bank of England next week.

The BoE may welcome data showing Britain's manufacturers unexpectedly reduced their prices in December as it weighs how much higher it needs to lift interest rates.

Events and analytics firm Ascential Plc (ASCL.L) bucked the broader trend, jumping 26.0% for its best day in more than two years after forecasting full-year EBITDA at the top end of market expectations.

EasyJet (EZJ.L) also jumped, by 9.7% to mark its biggest one day percentage gain since March 2022, as the airline indicated it expected to beat market expectations for 2023 on strong bookings into summer.

Ryanair (RYA.I) added 2.3% and British Airways parent IAG (ICAG.L) rose 2.0% to its highest since February 2022.

Insurer Aviva (AV.L) gained 3.3% after maintaining its dividend guidance and capital returns outlook, and pub operator J D Wetherspoon (JDW.L) dropped 6.1% after saying it was ""cautiously optimistic"" about this financial year.

622,173,Microsoft,2023-01-25,"Italy seeks clarification, prompt solution to massive email outage","













MILAN, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Italy's government has sought clarification over an outage that has been affecting nine million users of Internet provider Italiaonline's webmail services since Jan. 23, it said on Wednesday.

Answering a query from Reuters, Italiaonline said it had no evidence at present that its problems bore any relation to those suffered on Wednesday by millions of Microsoft (MSFT.O) users.

Undersecretary Alessio Butti, who is in charge of technological innovation, said in a statement he had asked Italiaonline for details and to protect users' data while promptly finding a solution to the problem impairing popular email services Libero and Virgilio.

""We expected to restore usage of Libero Mail and Virgilio Mail within the next 24/48 hours,"" Italiaonline said in a statement.

Chief Technology Officer Diego Rizzi on Tuesday ruled out an external cyber attack and said the company had been working relentlessly to solve ""an unforeseen infrastructural problem"".

Italiaonline, Italy's largest internet company and owned by Egypt's Sawiris family, earlier on Wednesday said the problem was linked to a bug in the operating system of newly-introduced storage technology provided by a vendor, which it did not identify.

""Given it's an operating system bug it takes time to develop a technical solution, with the primary goal of protecting data integrity,"" Italiaonline said.

Microsoft on Wednesday said it had recovered all of its cloud services after a networking outage took down its cloud platform Azure along with services such as Teams and Outlook used by millions around the globe.

Summary Companies Outage impacts Microsoft cloud platform Azure for hours

Multiple Microsoft services including Teams and Outlook hit

Microsoft says most customers now have service restored

Shares down 3.2%















Jan 25 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Wednesday it had recovered all of its cloud services after a networking outage took down its cloud platform Azure along with services such as Teams and Outlook used by millions around the globe.

Azure's status page showed services were impacted in Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa. Only services in China and its platform for governments were not hit.

By late morning Azure said most customers should have seen services resume after a full recovery of the Microsoft Wide Area Network (WAN).

An outage of Azure, which has 15 million corporate customers and over 500 million active users, according to Microsoft data, can impact multiple services and create a domino effect as almost all of the world's largest companies use the platform.

Businesses have become increasingly dependent on online platforms after the pandemic caused a shift to more employees working from home.

Earlier, Microsoft said it had determined a network connectivity issue was occurring with devices across the Microsoft WAN. This impacts connectivity between clients on the internet to Azure, as well as connectivity between services in data centres, it said.

Microsoft later tweeted that it had rolled back a network change that it believed was causing the issue and was using ""additional infrastructure to expedite the recovery process"".

Microsoft did not disclose the number of users affected by the disruption, but data from outage tracking website Downdetector showed thousands of incidents across continents.

The Downdetector site tracks outages by collating status reports from various sources including users.

Microsoft's cloud business had helped shore up its fiscal second-quarter earnings on Tuesday. It forecast third-quarter revenue in its so-called intelligent cloud business would be $21.7 billion to $22 billion despite worries that the lucrative cloud segment for big tech companies could be hit hard as customers look to cut spending.

Azure's share of the cloud computing market rose to 30% in 2022, trailing Amazon's AWS, according to estimates from BofA Global Research.

Microsoft joined other big tech companies in turning to layoffs to ride out the weaker economy, announcing last week it was cutting over 10,000 jobs.

Its shares were down 3.2% at $234.41.

Outages of Big Tech platforms are not uncommon as several companies ranging from Google (GOOGL.O) to Meta (META.O) have seen service disruptions. Azure, the second largest cloud services provider after Amazon (AMZN.O), faced outages last year.

During the outage, users faced problems in exchanging messages, joining calls or using any features of Teams application. Many users took to Twitter to share updates about the service disruption, with #MicrosoftTeams trending as a hashtag on the social media site.

Microsoft Teams, used by more than 280 million people globally, forms an integral part of daily operations for businesses and schools, which use the service to make calls, schedule meetings and organise their workflow.

There were few signs of significant disruption at major UK-based financial services firms, where multiple messaging applications offered by providers like Movius and Symphony are used alongside Microsoft Teams to connect bankers with clients, and office-based staff with colleagues working remotely.

Two London-based sources, working at two major global banks, said they hadn't even noticed a problem.

Deutsche Boerse Group, which operates the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, said there had been no impact on trading. Frankfurt-based Commerzbank AG (CBKG.DE) said in a statement that Microsoft was investigating several issues impacting the bank.

Among the other services affected were Microsoft Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, according to the company's status page.

""I think there is a very big debate to be had on resiliency in the comms and cloud space and the critical applications,"" Symphony Chief Executive Brad Levy said.

624,135,Microsoft,2023-01-25,Microsoft's dour outlook raises red flags for tech sector,"













Jan 25 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) lackluster quarterly outlook points to more gloom ahead for the tech sector, analysts said, after the tech bellwether warned that its customers were cautious about spending in a turbulent economy.

The warning from Microsoft, the second most valuable U.S. company, came after a steep fall in client spending prompted tech heavyweights from Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) to Meta Platforms (META.O) to slash jobs and save cash.

Microsoft, along with Big Tech peers Amazon and Apple Inc , pared losses from earlier on Wednesday to trade nearly 1% lower. Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) was down 3%. The companies are four of the biggest by market value in the United States.

Shares of cloud companies including IBM Corp (IBM.N) and Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) all declined. IBM is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results later in the day.

Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella and other company executives used the words ""caution"" and ""cautious"" at least six times on the one-hour call on Tuesday.

""The rate of Microsoft's revenue slowdown should be seen as a warning sign for the wider tech sector,"" Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Sophie Lund-Yates said.

Analysts expect other tech executives to follow Nadella in laying out a conservative outlook.

""What we learned is that no one is immune to macro ... what is telling is the quarter was largely fine, but we started to see softness in December and the outlook for this quarter was worse than expected,"" said Rishi Jaluria, analyst at RBC.

Microsoft forecast third-quarter revenue in its so-called intelligent cloud business a tad below market estimates, with a growth rate of as much as 19%. The segment outperformed expectations in the second quarter, however, which initially boosted shares on Tuesday evening.

""That (the outlook) is taking the wind out of the sails,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.

Nadella, however, said Microsoft would focus on AI technology, calling it the next major wave of computing.

The tech giant has made multibillion dollar investments in OpenAI, deepening ties with the startup behind the chatbot sensation ChatGPT and building on a bet it made on AI four years ago.

With many tech companies now focusing on building their cash reserves, analysts expect the money to be used for other investments - from fresh buybacks, mergers and acquisitions or new technology such as artificial intelligence.

Summary Companies STOXX 600 falls for second straight day

Microsoft's outlook weighs on the tech sector

German business morale brightens further in Jan















Jan 25 (Reuters) - European stocks slipped on Wednesday as lacklustre results from U.S. software giant Microsoft fanned fears about the outlook for the tech sector, while investors remained concerned that central banks were not yet close to pausing their interest rate hikes.

The pan-European STOXX 600 (.STOXX) fell for a second day, closing down 0.3% but off a near two-week low hit earlier in the session.

Technology shares (.SX8P), which have rebounded this year after a rough 2022, fell 0.4% as Microsoft (MSFT.O) forecast current-quarter cloud business revenue below estimates.

""The weak outlook painted by Microsoft is weighing on the wider tech sector,"" said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London.

Energy (.SXEP) and industrial firms (.SXNP) were also big drags on the STOXX 600, falling 0.9% and 0.8% respectively.

Equities have rallied this year on hopes that the Federal Reserve and other major central banks were close to hitting the brakes on interest rate hikes as inflation eases.

However, such hopes have been doused in recent days by hawkish messages from European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers as well as an improvement in euro zone economic activity that has spurred speculation that the central bank might have more room to raise rates.

European Central Bank policymakers Joachim Nagel and Gabriel Makhlouf on Wednesday said they wouldn't be surprised if policymakers needed to keep increasing interest rates beyond March.

Economists at Deutsche Bank no longer expect a euro zone recession in 2023 and also lowered their inflation outlook, but don't see the ECB taking their foot off the hawkish pedal just yet.

German business morale brightened in January as Europe's largest economy started the new year with easing inflation and an improved outlook, the Ifo institute's survey showed.

Europe's earnings season kicks into gear next week. Earnings for STOXX 600 companies are expected to have increased 9.5% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, down from 10.7% a week ago, according to Refinitiv data.

Corporate results from some European companies such as semiconductor firm ASML Holding NV (ASML.AS) on Wednesday offered some reasons for optimism about the region's corporate health.

Netcompany Group A/S (NETCG.CO) tumbled 21.2% to the bottom of the STOXX 600 after the Danish IT services provider's EBITDA outlook missed analysts' expectations.

Shares of Lonza (LONN.S) jumped 7.5% as the Swiss drug contract manufacturer said it will buy back shares worth 2 billion Swiss francs ($2.17 billion).

A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Anshuman Daga

After a strong start to the year, fuelled by hopes that the outlook for the world economy was not shaping up as bad as expected a few months ago, stocks are finally taking a breather.

Asian equities held steady on Wednesday near seven-month highs after a mixed session on Wall Street.

On the corporate front, Barclays (BARC.L) CEO C.S. Venkatakrishnan appointed former Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) dealmaker Cathal Deasy as co-head of investment banking with a view to grow the business and an eye for succession.

And a group of minority shareholders that appealed against the French government's full nationalisation of energy giant EDF (EDF.PA) dropped the motion on the eve of the hearing.

On a thin day for economic data, focus will be on U.K. producer prices and the German IFO.

European stock futures dipped 0.3%, indicating a weaker start for markets, while U.S. stock futures shed 0.5%.

Revenue at Europe's largest companies is expected to have risen by just 0.9% in the fourth quarter, Refinitiv I/B/E/S data showed on Tuesday.

The forecast, which tracks companies listed on the pan-European STOXX 600 (.STOXX) benchmark index, represents a drop from last week when analysts expected revenue growth of 4%.

Analysts downgrade earnings forecasts

Investment strategists at Standard Chartered say it is time to fade the rally seen in European stocks and the euro since the lows of September.

They say an unusually warm winter has allayed fears of wide-spread energy shortages and rationing in Europe. China's economic reopening has been another tailwind for European exporters' prospects.

But they outlined many challenges for European equities, including stretched technicals and an increasingly hawkish central bank policy.

Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT.O) kicked off the U.S. tech season with a sobering outlook and forecast that third-quarter revenue in its cloud business would come just shy of market forecasts.

The 2% increase in the last quarter's revenue, the slowest in more than five years, signalled tougher times for tech companies just as Apple (AAPL.O) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) are due to report earnings next week.

627,689,Microsoft,2023-01-25,Morning bid: Cloudy outlook,"













A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.

With market visibility extremely low, bouts of optimism about peak interest rates this year are being repeatedly punctured by the related fear of falling demand and the prospect of a looming profits recession.

And deep in the weeds of the fourth-quarter corporate earnings season, Microsoft's (MSFT.O) overnight rollercoaster probably defines the uncertainty.

Microsoft stock surged almost 5% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after its bottom line beat the Street consensus. But the gains were quickly wiped out after a gloomier outlook for its cloud business Azure dampened the mood, before Wednesday's outage of its Teams and Outlook services added another glitch to leave the stock down 1% ahead of Wednesday's open.

The mixed earnings picture dampened early week enthusiasm surrounding tech stocks and chipmakers. Even forecast sales growth of 25% in 2023 wasn't enough to stop shares in Dutch chip equipment giant ASML (ASML.AS) giving back some of its 20%-plus gains for the year so far and they dropped 2% on Wednesday.

Antitrust worries also rattled Big Tech. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) lost 2% on Tuesday after the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Google for abusing its dominance of the digital advertising business.

Up next on the corporate roundup on Wednesday are Tesla, IBM, Boeing, AT&T and NextEra Energy.

After a spluttering close on Tuesday, Wall St stock futures were down almost 1% before the open today.

The bigger macro picture was no less equivocal than the earnings drumbeat.

While the first U.S. business surveys of the year showed some of last year's pessimism lifting, and above forecast, they also showed the 7th straight month of contracting activity in January. The Richmond Federal Reserve's manufacturing index plunged back to its lowest since June, the low for the current cycle.

U.S. Treasury yields slipped back, with 10-year yields falling to 3.43% as eyes drift to next week's Fed policy meeting and the assumption the central bank will downsize its latest rate rise to 25 basis points. With the debt ceiling impasse also in the background, the U.S. yield curve between 3-months and 10-years inverted to another 40-year low of minus 130bp.

Traders will watch the Bank of Canada policy decision later on Wednesday for confirmation that interest rate rises are slowing down at least. The BoC is expected to raise rates by another 25bp to 4.5% this week, but then hit the pause button on what has been an aggressive tightening campaign.

The global inflation picture also gives mixed signals.

While annual British input and factory gate price inflation fell back far more than forecast last month, Australian consumer price inflation data shocked markets as it shot to a 33-year high in the December quarter. The chance it may force the Reserve Bank of Australia to lift interest rates again boosted the Aussie dollar.

There was more evidence of the new year euro zone business rejuvenation as Germany firms' optimism improved amid easing energy costs and a warm winter.

In deals news, Rupert Murdoch withdrew a proposal to reunite News Corp (NWSA.O) and Fox - with the company exploring a sale of Move Inc, which operates the Realtor.com website, to CoStar Group for about $3 billion.

Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday:

* Bank of Canada policy decision.

* U.S. Treasury Secretary visits South Africa

* U.S. Treasury auctions 5-year note, 2-year floating rate note

* U.S. corp earnings: Tesla, Ameriprise, Nasdaq, U.S. Bancorp, Abbott, NextEra, AT&T, IBM, Boeing, CSX, Seagate Technology, Crown Castle, Lam Research, Freeport-McMoRan, Hess, Las Vegas Sands, ADP, ServiceNow, Teradyne, United Rentals, Kimberly-Clark, Norfolk Southern, Marketaxess, Amphenol, Textron etc

628,31,Microsoft,2023-01-25,"Microsoft attracting users to its code-writing, generative AI software","













Jan 24 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Tuesday aimed to assure investors that its big bet on artificial intelligence (AI) is paying off, even as economic turbulence is making Microsoft customers scrutinize their cloud spend.

Early evidence is in usage of a little-discussed tool that can write computer code for programmers, called GitHub Copilot.

Opened up to the public in June of last year, the tool drew 400,000 subscribers within a month. On Tuesday, Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said that more than 1 million people had used Copilot to date.

Microsoft shares dipped slightly in after-hours trade on Tuesday following its forecast that cloud-computing revenue in the current quarter was just below Wall Street expectations.

Yet the growth in Copilot is a preliminary indication that people will pay for so-called generative AI, tech that can produce prose, imagery or in this case computer code on command after having learned the skill from vast data.

Copilot suggests to programmers what to type next, writing up to 35% or 40% of a file's code when enabled, the CEO of GitHub, owned by Microsoft, said last year. It costs $100 annually for individual subscribers, or can be billed through a corporate account, according to a GitHub blog post.

Microsoft this week said it would embark on a multibillion-dollar investment including supercomputer development and cloud support to power a startup it first backed in 2019, known as OpenAI, which is at the forefront of generative AI.

Copilot itself relies on OpenAI's tech, as does a chatbot sensation that Open AI released last year known as ChatGPT. Microsoft has said it will make ChatGPT, which can draft code as well as essays or poetry, available via its cloud.

ChatGPT has grabbed enough attention to prompt industry observers to say it could answer any user query if updated, potentially letting Microsoft's Bing search engine take on Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, the industry leader. Google is working on its own major AI launch, Reuters previously reported.

Nadella said the Azure OpenAI Service, which offers the startup's tech through Microsoft's cloud, has already attracted 200 customers, including KPMG and Al Jazeera.

Summary

Summary Companies Battle of whether downturn forces Fed rate cut simmers

Corporate outlooks, results point to slowing economy

Yield curve ""inversion"" flash recession ahead















NEW YORK, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Global equity markets skidded on Wednesday as poor corporate results fueled recession fears, as did the ongoing inversion of short- and long-dated Treasury yields - a harbinger of economic downturns.

But the main indexes on Wall Street sharply pared losses, suggesting that many believe a downturn, coupled with rising unemployment, will lead the Federal Reserve to back off its aggressive monetary tightening and soon cut interest rates.

Short-dated Treasury yields have been inverted, or higher than longer-dated government debt, for some time. The yield curve on three-month bills and 10-year notes narrowed on Wednesday, but was still deeply inverted at -123.5 basis points.

""Every recession has been preceded by some type of yield curve inversion,"" said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in New York.

But with the Fed's overnight borrowing rate at 4.25%-4.5%, it is ""restrictive"" and slowing growth, potentially causing large job losses in the next month or two that will lead the U.S. central bank to cut interest rates by mid-year, he said.

""I could be right about the economy and the labor market, but the Fed may still say we're going to drive the economy lower until there's no fear that inflation is going to kick back up.""

Corporate America also signaled trouble ahead. Boeing's downbeat results on Wednesday amid ongoing supply chain constraints added to slower growth concerns, while Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) warned its customers were cautious about spending in an uncertain economy in a lackluster outlook late Tuesday.

Futures are pricing in a 94.7% probability of a 25 bps hike when Feb policymakers end a two-day meeting on Feb. 1.

The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was down 2.2 basis points to 3.445%, well below the Fed's projection that its target rate will stay above 5% into next year.

Two out of three Americans say they're more concerned about paying bills than saving for their financial future, said Johan Grahn, head of ETFs at Allianz Investment Management in Minneapolis, citing a survey done by his company.

While the U.S. central bank will make some changes, ""they're not significant enough to scare the Fed away from its stated marching orders,"" Grahn said. ""The enemy is inflation, the catalyst is the labor market and that's the bottom line.""

Wall Street closed littled changed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 0.03%, the S&P 500 (.SPX) slid 0.02% and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 0.18% after losses of more than 2% earlier.

Trade in European stocks was lacklustre, as signs of an improving economic outlook in the euro zone fed worries about further rate hikes.

The broad pan-European STOXX 600 index (.STOXX) lost 0.29% and MSCI's gauge of global stock performance (.MIWD00000PUS) closed up 0.05% to eke out a fresh five-month closing high after trading much lower most of the day.

Markets have been buffeted by the fastest tightening of monetary policy since the 1980s.

The Bank of Canada signaled it would likely halt further hikes after lifting its key interest rate to 4.5% on Wednesday.

Earlier the Australian dollar hit a five-month high as rising inflation data bolstered the case for another rate increase from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) next month.

The Canadian dollar fell 0.11% versus the greenback at 1.34 per dollar after the central bank's outlook.

The Australian dollar surged to $0.7123 after the latest inflation data. Australia's currency is up 1.6% this week and is poised for its biggest weekly gain in more than two months.

The euro rose 0.26% to $1.0913.

In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) hit a seven-month high. Trading volume was depressed as Chinese and Taiwanese markets were still closed for the Lunar New Year holiday.

Data showing German business morale brightened in January did little to push the single currency higher for now.

Germany's Ifo institute said its business climate index rose to 90.2, in line with the consensus, according to a Reuters poll of analysts, and up from 88.6 in December.

Oil prices settled largely unchanged after government data showed a smaller-than-anticipated build in U.S. crude inventories, countering weak economic data from Tuesday.

Brent crude futures settled at $86.12 a barrel, down a cent, while the U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled at $80.15 a barrel, down by two cents.

Gold reversed course to edge up as the dollar weakened and investors kept a close eye on a slew of upcoming U.S. economic data that could influence the Fed's policy meeting next week.

U.S. gold futures settled up 0.4% to $1,942.60 an ounce.

630,692,Microsoft,2023-01-25,S&P 500 closes slightly red as weak corporate guidance fuels recession fears,"Summary

Summary Companies AT&T gains on subscriber adds

General Dynamics slides after weak outlook

Tesla, IBM post results

Indexes: Dow up 0.03%, S&P 500 off 0.02%, Nasdaq down 0.18%















NEW YORK, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended nominally lower on Wednesday as a string of corporate earnings ran the gamut from downbeat to dismal, reviving worries over the economic impact of the U.S. Federal Reserve's restrictive policy.

All three major U.S. stock indexes pared their losses throughout the afternoon to close well off session lows, with the blue-chip Dow eking out a small gain in the final minutes.

The tech-laden Nasdaq was weighed down after Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), the first major technology firm to post quarterly results, offered dour guidance and raised red flags with respect to its megacap peers which have yet to report.

""We’ve had up and down days, that indicates an ongoing tug-of-war,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. ""The dour guidance good news from the standpoint of what the Fed is doing is working.""

""That outcome has become the catalyst for the market one way or the other,"" Carlson added. ""Earnings matter but what’s really got the market’s focus is the Fed interest rate/inflation story.""

Fourth-quarter earnings season has shifted into overdrive, with 95 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 67% have beat consensus estimates, well below the 76% average beat rate over the past four quarters, according to Refintiv.

Analysts now see aggregate S&P 500 earnings dropping 3.0% year-on-year, nearly double the 1.6% drop seen on Jan. 1, per Refinitiv.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 9.88 points, or 0.03%, to 33,743.84, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 0.73 points, or 0.02%, to 4,016.22 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 20.92 points, or 0.18%, to 11,313.36.

Five of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 ended lower, with utilities (.SPLRCU) suffering the largest percentage loss.

Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) dropped 1.4%, as weaker-than-expected medical device sales weighed on the stock.

Among gainers, News Corp (NWSA.O) jumped 5.7% after Rupert Murdoch withdrew a proposal to reunite News Corp and Fox Corp.

AT&T Inc (T.N) also delivered disappointing guidance but its renewed focus on its telecoms business helped boost subscriber numbers, sending its shares up 6.6%.

General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) beat quarterly expectations, but a weak 2023 forecast helped send the defense contractor's shares sliding 3.6%.

Shares of Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) whipsawed in extended trading after the electric auto maker beat fourth quarter revenue estimates.

IBM (IBM.N) advanced after hours in the wake of posting its highest annual revenue growth in a decade.

Shares of Levi Strauss & Co jumped more than 6%in extended trade after the jeans maker provided upbeat 2023 guidance.

Finally, in a post-script to Tuesday's technical glitch which halted the opening auctions for a spate of stocks and prompted a review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) said a manual error resulted in the snafu which caused widespread confusion at the opening bell.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.25-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.13-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 8 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 61 new highs and 30 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.89 billion shares, compared with the 10.78 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

Jan 25 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc's (META.O) social media apps appeared to be back up after facing a brief disruption in the United States on Wednesday, data on outage tracking website Downdetector.com showed.

At the peak of the outage, more than 17,000 user reports had indicated issues with Instagram in the United States, as of 2352 GMT. Over 13,000 incidents were reported for the Facebook app and outage reports also briefly spiked for WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger around the same time.

Downdetector tracks outages by collating status reports from several sources including user-submitted errors on its platform.

Outages of Big Tech platforms are not uncommon as several companies ranging from Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google to Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) have seen service disruptions.

Microsoft was hit with a networking outage earlier on Wednesday that took down its cloud platform Azure along with services such as Teams and Outlook, affecting millions of users globally.

Meta did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

632,147,Microsoft,2023-01-26,Sony's gaming chief met EU's Vestager on Microsoft's Activision deal -source,"













BRUSSELS, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Sony's gaming chief Jim Ryan met EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager on Wednesday to discuss Microsoft's (MSFT.O) $69 billion bid for ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O), a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday.

The meeting came as the EU competition watchdog prepares to warn Microsoft this week about the potential anti-competitive effects of the U.S. software giant and Xbox maker's acquisition in the biggest gaming industry deal in history.

Microsoft is looking to Activision to help it compete better with leaders Tencent (0700.HK) and Sony (6758.T). The latter has criticised the deal and even called for a regulatory veto.

The person declined to provide details of the discussion between Ryan and Vestager. The European Commission, which is scheduled to rule on the deal by April 11, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has sued to block the deal while UK regulators have also expressed concerns.

Jan 26 (Reuters) - A landmark lawsuit by the U.S. Justice Department against Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google over its dominance of advertising technology could help rivals and websites that sell ad space, but leaves an uncertain future for the advertisers themselves, experts told Reuters.

The Justice Department's complaint against Google on Tuesday called for the company to divest Google Ad Manager, a suite of tools including one that lets websites put ad space up for a sale and another that served as an ad marketplace that automatically matched advertisers with those publishers.

If the Justice Department lawsuit succeeds, ""advertisers and publishers could have more leverage with more options with expanding players – and consequently more competition,"" said Neil Begley of Moody's Investors Service.

Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which is steadily growing its nascent advertising business and promoting it as privacy-focused, could be a winner if Google ads become less effective, said Brian Mandelbaum, chief executive of ad tech company Attain.

Ad industry executives say Google's business in placing ads on websites it does not own gives Google valuable information on an ad's effectiveness.

Apple has ""an ability to be a new dominant force,"" in advertising because Apple has data through its ownership of phones, its Safari web browser and the distribution of apps through the App Store, he said.

Google's competitors in ad tech are increasingly creating products that serve both the publishers like news websites, which sell ad space, and advertisers who buy ads, like Google currently does, said Paul Bannister, chief strategy officer at CafeMedia, which helps small and medium-sized publishers sell ad space.

If Google is forced to divest the tools that serve publishers, it would benefit competitors like Xandr, which is owned by Microsoft (MSFT.O), that will still work with both sides of the ad-buying ecosystem, Bannister said.

With more options besides Google, publishers will have more transparency over how much they can sell ad space for, and could end up paying less in fees, Mandelbaum said.

If successful, the lawsuit could be ""the beginning of serious business model changes for Google,"" said Paul Gallant, managing director at Cowen Washington Research Group.

The divested assets could result in Google losing key data that helps target ads to relevant consumers, he said.

If Google loses access to data signals, advertisers could see their Google ads become less effective, said Nikhil Lai, senior analyst at research firm Forrester.

At least twice before, the government has filed lawsuits against dominant companies with far-reaching results. A lawsuit breaking up AT&T, filed in 1974, resulted in an agreement in 1982 to break up the company. That breakup has been credited with a host of innovations in telephony.

The Justice Department's lawsuit against Microsoft, filed in 1998, reined in the company at a time when it was seeking to extend its dominant operating system to the internet browser. While the lawsuit settled, the fight is credited with opening the way for other internet innovators, like Google itself.

Jan 26 (Reuters) - Spotify Technology SA's (SPOT.N) music streaming platform suffered a brief outage on Thursday, leaving tens of thousands of users unable to access the platform before services appeared to come back online.

""Everything's looking much better now,"" Spotify Status, an account that provides updates about the platform's status, said in a tweet.

In the second such outage within two weeks, more than 41,000 Spotify users reported on Downdetector.com they were having issues with the streaming platform at the peak of the disruption.

As Spotify was coming back online, Downdetector said reports of outages had fallen below 2,000.

Spotify suffered a brief outage earlier this month, with more than 45,000 affected users from the United States at the peak of the disruption.

A networking outage at Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Wednesday took down its cloud platform along with services such as Teams and Outlook, hitting millions of users globally, while Meta Platforms Inc's(META.O) social media apps also faced a brief disruption.

Summary Companies To cut around 2.5% of global workforce

Sees 300-350 mln euros savings run-rate in 2024

SAP exploring sale of 71% stake in Qualtrics















BERLIN/STOCKHOLM, Jan 26 (Reuters) - SAP (SAPG.DE) said on Thursday it planned to cut 3,000 jobs, or 2.5% of its global workforce, and explore the sale of its remaining stake in Qualtrics, as the Germany software company looks to cut costs and focus on its cloud business.

SAP is the latest tech company to cut jobs after companies including Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) announced thousands of layoffs to cut costs as they brace for tougher economic conditions.

""We expect only a moderate cost saving impact for 2023, and a more pronounced one in 2024, about 300 million euros to 350 million in run rate savings as of 2024,"" Chief Financial Officer Luka Mucic said in a call with journalists.

In Germany, where SAP is headquartered, the company will cut slightly more than 200 jobs.

The layoffs come after SAP reported a 30% revenue increase in its cloud business in the fourth quarter, helped by strong demand for its software.

SAP has also started the process to sell its stake in Qualtrics (XM.O). It bought the company for $8 billion in 2018 and took it public in 2021 at a valuation of nearly $21 billion.

Currently, survey-software seller Qualtrics has a market value of $7 billion and SAP has a 71% stake.

""(The sale) would result in a quite significant one-time gain,"" Mucic said. ""This would materially increase the profit performance of SAP, but it's currently not reflected in the outlook.""

SAP forecast core operating profit of 8.8-8.9 billion euros at constant currencies for this year. It also expects cloud revenue at constant currencies for 2023 to rise to 15.3-15.7 billion euros, from 12.56 billion euros last year.

While analysts had raised concerns that SAP'S lucrative cloud business might take a hit with other companies tightening their budgets due to economic uncertainty, SAP has been signing more customers.

""We are going to announce a unique strategic partnership with BMW betting on SAP on all dimensions - one of the biggest deals ever, which was signed yesterday,"" Chief Executive Christian Klein said.

636,635,Microsoft,2023-01-26,"Intel 'stumbled,' CEO says; shares drop 9.5% as loss forecast","













Jan 26 (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) said on Thursday it expects to lose money in the current quarter, surprising investors with a bleaker-than-expected outlook for both the PC market and slowing growth in its key data center division.

The company's shares fell 9.5% in trading after the bell.

""We stumbled, right, we lost share, we lost momentum. We think that stabilizes this year,"" Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told investors on a conference call. He said Intel has been losing market share in the data center market, a nod at the strength of rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O)

Two of Intel's most important markets are showing weakness after two years of strong growth as remote work boomed during the pandemic. Now, the PC industry is struggling with a glut of chips after demand for consumer electronics fell off a cliff and business customers wary of a recession are slowing spending on data centers.

Gelsinger told Reuters that customers also were emptying inventory.

""We expect some of the largest inventory corrections literally that we've ever seen in the industry taking place that's affecting the Q1 guide in a meaningful way,"" he said.

""Everything hinges on the PC market recovery. AMD isn’t immune to this either,"" said Wayne Lam, an analyst at CCS Insight. ""Don’t think we’ve seen the bottom for INTC...They are not running a sustainable business model.""

Intel expects profit margins to fall further after dropping from 58.4% in the fourth quarter of 2020 to 43.8% in the fourth quarter of 2022. ""Its safe to say that ambitions to return to a 60% margin in the future is light years away,"" said CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino.

Reuters Graphics

Intel reiterated its medium-term goal of 51-53% gross margin, and 54-58% longer term.

Shares of other microchip companies fell as well, with AMD down 2.6% and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) down 2%.

PC shipments fell 16.5% to 292.3 million units in 2022, per data from research firm IDC, forcing chipmakers to cut back production and slash revenue forecasts.

Reuters Graphics

Shrinking PC demand also pressured Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) More Personal Computing segment, which includes Windows, devices and search revenue, leading to a 19% drop in the segment in its second quarter.

Meanwhile, the data center market has also slowed from double-digit growth as businesses cut costs to ride out an economic slowdown.

After Gelsinger returned to the company nearly two years ago, Intel has focused on regaining the lead in chipmaking technology. Outsourcing the chipmaking process has helped rivals like AMD make much smaller and faster chips and outpace Intel's technology.

The company forecast first-quarter revenue in the range of about $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion. Analysts on average were expecting total revenue of $13.93 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

The company expects an adjusted loss of 15 cents per share versus expectations of a 24 cents per share profit.

Revenue in the fourth quarter fell 32% to $14 billion. Analysts on average expected revenue of $14.46 billion.

637,763,Microsoft,2023-01-27,Take Five: Goldilocks and the three bears,"













Jan 27 (Reuters) - Not too hot and not too cold. That's what investors are hoping for in terms of the economic outlook, as China recovers from COVID and as companies grapple with sticky inflation and increasingly cash-strapped consumers.

But the story three of the world's largest central banks, set to hold their first policy meetings of 2023, tell isn't that of a ""Goldilocks"" scenario of a gentle slowdown in growth and a gradual easing in inflation.

Here's a look at the week ahead in markets from Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, Dhara Ranasinghe and Naomi Rovnik in London and Ira Iosebashvili and Lewis Krauskopf in New York.

1/WILL THE FED FOLD?

Will the Federal Reserve tone down its hawkish rhetoric in the face of cooling inflation or stick to its guns? Investors widely expect a 25-basis point rate increase at the Feb. 1 meeting and for rates to stop short of hitting 5%.

Fed officials, however, have indicated they expect the key policy rate to top out at 5.00-5.25% this year.

Whatever signals the Fed sends could play an importing role in determining the longevity of the rally so far this year. Dollar bears, meanwhile, will watch for dovish leanings that could further accelerate a decline in the greenback. The currency has tumbled nearly 11% since hitting multi-decade highs last September.

Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics

2/ BACK FROM BREAK

Chinese markets are back from the week-long Lunar New Year holidays, and will look to pick up where they left off - at a five-month peak for mainland blue chips (.CSI300).

The mood should stay bullish after officials said COVID deaths have dropped about 80% from the peak earlier this month, running counter to worries that the New Year travel rush would trigger a fresh wave of infections.

Some experts even suggest that the surge in cases after the government abruptly reversed its zero-COVID policies last month has resulted in hyper-speedy herd immunity.

The impact of China's Great Reopening may show up in PMIs next Tuesday, with the services sector bouncing back to expansion. Manufacturing is likely still contracting, but that has a lot to do with the timing of the New Year holiday, and next month should see a strong rebound.

China's convalescent business activity

3/ YOUR MOVE, ECB

The ECB meets Thursday and is widely tipped to raise rates by 50 bps to 2.5%. Markets care most about what happens next and that's not clear.

Policy hawks are already pushing for more of the same in March. After all, inflation is well above the 2% target as preliminary January data out on Wednesday is likely to show.

Futures price in a further 100 bps worth of tightening between now and July. Amundi reckons ECB rates could reach 4%.

But the doves are getting louder. Yes, inflation is high but it's off record peaks, they say. So, caution is needed before pre-commiting to rate hikes beyond February.

Markets, whipped around by the differing opinions, will be looking for the ECB to speak with one voice. That, at least, is the hope.

4/THE ""A"" TEAM

The three ""A's"" -- Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) - three of the top four U.S. companies by market value - all report earnings on Thursday.

Over 100 companies in the S&P 500 deliver results as the earnings season gets into full swing.

Microsoft, the fourth of the U.S. megacaps, has already reported results. Its cloud business hit Wall Street targets, but it delivered a lacklustre forecast that offered little cheer to the broader tech sector.

Tech companies generally are under pressure to grow while cutting costs ahead of a potential recession.

S&P 500 earnings are set to have fallen 2.9% from the year-ago period, according to Refinitiv IBES data as of Tuesday.

Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics

5/THE END MAY BE NIGH

The Bank of England, the first of the major central banks to turn hawkish, is expected to deliver its tenth rate hike since December 2021.

Money markets predict the BoE will raise rates by 0.5 percentage points to 4%. Headline inflation moderated in December to 10.5%, but it's still over five times the Bank's official target.

Deutsche Bank analysts say this will be the BoE's final ""forceful"" hike. Recent data has shown a sharp contraction in UK business activity and lacklustre Christmas retail sales.

Economists polled by Reuters now expect the BoE to stop at 4.25%. But many cited sticky core inflation, which excludes food and energy costs, as the main reason they could be wrong.

638,484,Microsoft,2023-01-27,ArcelorMittal leads $120 mln funding for green steel tech firm,"













NEW YORK, Jan 26 (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal (MT.LU) has led the latest, $120 million round of investment for Boston Metal in the startup's quest to go to market by 2026 with equipment capable of taking the heavy greenhouse gas emissions out of steel production, the companies said.

Much of the world's steel is currently made in coal-fired blast furnaces and its producers are coming under increasing pressure to reduce their contribution to global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions that cause climate change. Steel producers are estimated to produce 7-9% of all harmful emissions, according to the World Steel Association.

Boston Metal makes parts for cells in which electricity splits iron ore, creating liquid iron and no byproducts or emissions apart from oxygen. As long as the power comes from renewable sources, this means carbon is completely eliminated from the process, Chief Executive Tadeu Carneiro said.

Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Climate Innovation Fund also joined current investors, who include carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE), in the investment, which will go toward expanding a pilot plant in Boston and building a new site in Brazil.

A big hurdle to so-called green steel is the cost of production, but this electrolysis process can compete with traditional methods as long as power costs $30-$40 per megawatt hour, Carneiro said, prices which can be achieved in places like the hydropower-rich Canadian province of Quebec.

Companies in steel-hungry sectors like carmaking have been reviewing their supply chains.

""What is the point of having an electric car running on a battery and carrying dirty steel?"" Carneiro asked.

ArcelorMittal's investment marks a shift in steel companies' willingness to invest in the technology since Boston Metal first went out looking for funding in 2018, Carneiro said.

Venture capital investors bought in, but the steelmakers did not bite at the time.

""Five or six years ago it seemed to be too early for them ... The environment changed completely. Now all the steelmaking companies are very interested in following what we are doing because they need a solution.""

639,458,Microsoft,2023-01-27,"Rolls-Royce alarm is justified, if oddly expressed","













LONDON, Jan 27 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Rolls-Royce's (RR.L) new boss Tufan Erginbilgic has the right sentiments, but arguably the wrong words. Less than a month into his new gig the leaking of a global broadcast to staff means investors now know the former BP (BP.L) executive thinks his employer is a ""burning platform"". Cue a 4% drop in Rolls’ share price.

In fairness, the Turkish-British national’s alarm is justified. “Burning platform” has become a familiar metaphor for corporate situations where radical action is called for, the idea being that staff would be better off taking their chances in the icy ocean than staying amid the flames. Rolls is a bit like that: its share price has dropped 70% since 2014. JPMorgan reckons the sum of its parts implies an equity value of only 70 pence a share, 30% below the current share price. Hence a wide-ranging breakup may not work. Erginbilgic could cut more jobs or pursue a sale of his power systems business, but both would put him at odds with the UK government.

The problem with the phrase is that it’s most associated with Nokia's (NOKIA.HE) then-Chief Executive Stephen Elop, who used it a decade ago to describe the Finnish group’s plight. While Elop took radical action by selling Nokia's phone unit to Microsoft (MSFT.O) for $7 billion, the deal didn’t work and the buyer had to write it down soon after. As such, Rolls’ investors and employees may not see Erginbilgic’s choice of words as massively encouraging. (By Pamela Barbaglia)

640,335,Microsoft,2023-01-27,Top French university bans use of ChatGPT to prevent plagiarism,"













PARIS, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Sciences Po, one of France's top universities, has banned the use of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence-based chatbot that can generate coherent prose, to prevent fraud and plagiarism.

ChatGPT is a free programme that generates original text about virtually any subject in response to a prompt, including articles, essays, jokes and even poetry, raising concerns across industries about plagiarism.

The university said on Friday the school had emailed all students and faculty announcing a ban on ChatGPT and all other AI-based tools at Sciences Po.

""Without transparent referencing, students are forbidden to use the software for the production of any written work or presentations, except for specific course purposes, with the supervision of a course leader,"" Sciences Po said, though it did not specify how it would track usage.

ChatGPT has already been banned in some public schools in New York City and Seattle, according to U.S. media reports, while several U.S. universities have announced plans to do fewer take-home assessments and more hand-written essays and oral exams.

Sciences Po, whose main campus is in Paris, added that punishment for using the software may go as far as exclusion from the institution, or even from French higher education as a whole.

""The ChatGPT software is raising important questions for educators and researchers all around the world, with regards to fraud in general, and particularly plagiarism,"" it said .

Microsoft Corp last week announced a further multibillion dollar investment in OpenAI - the artificial intelligence research lab behind ChatGPT - building on a bet it made on OpenAI nearly four years ago, when it dedicated $1 billion for the startup co-founded by Tesla's Elon Musk and investor Sam Altman.

The company appointed the chief executive of hedge fund ValueAct Capital, Mason Morfit, Mastercard (MA.N) finance chief Sachin Mehra and former chief executive of Carnival Corp (CCL.N) Arnold Donald to its board.

The men will join on March 1 when two directors, who have each served two decades, will be leaving.

The moves have been long-planned as lead independent director Robin Washington has been steering the process to focus more on operational skills since last summer, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday.

However, the appointments also come as the company has been facing pressure publicly and privately from four prominent activist investment firms. Elliott Management, the biggest among them, is set to launch a board challenge next month.

Elliott, which invests over $55 billion, has been engaging with Salesforce for roughly a week and is currently interviewing candidates that it plans to nominate as directors, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.

Additionally Starboard Value, run by Jeffrey Smith, Inclusive Capital, run by Jeffrey Ubben, and ValueAct, which was founded by Ubben, have owned shares in Salesforce for months and have held talks with the company, sources said.

Starboard has pushed for considerable cost cuts while other investors have criticized recent acquisitions and pay at the company.

Many activist investors push target companies to add a shareholder to the board to represent investors' views.

By picking ValueAct's Morfit, Salesforce likely made a calculated bet that the San Francisco-based investment firm, which has a reputation for working collaboratively behind the scenes, might be more agreeable on the board than other activists, bankers and lawyers said.

Morfit has served as a director at Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals.

ValueAct has deep experience in aiding software companies with transformations, having served on the board of Microsoft and Adobe, which have ballooned in size since ValueAct's involvement.

At the same time Elliott has also made significant investments in technology companies and has won board seats at companies including Pinterest (PINS.N), Twitter and eBay (EBAY.O).

Elliott's decision to wage a proxy contest signals a quick shift from when the firm reached out to Salesforce. Jesse Cohn, managing partner at Elliott, said on Sunday that he was looking forward to working ""constructively"" with the company and that he has ""developed a deep respect for Marc Benioff,"" Salesforce's co-founder and co-chief executive.

Salesforce's stock price, which has climbed up 22.5% this year, rose modestly at the start of trading on Friday.

Earlier this year, the company announced plans to cut 10% of its jobs and close some offices after rapid pandemic hiring left it with a bloated workforce.

Salesforce directors Sanford Robertson and Alan Hassenfeld, board members since 2003, will not stand for re-election, the company said.

Law firms Related documents Companies say allegations are not specific enough, cite fair-use defense

Anonymous plaintiffs say OpenAI and Microsoft are misusing copyrighted source code















(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp, Microsoft's GitHub Inc and OpenAI Inc told a San Francisco federal court that a proposed class-action lawsuit for improperly monetizing open-source code to train their artificial-intelligence systems cannot be sustained.

The companies said in Thursday court filings that the complaint, filed by a group of anonymous copyright owners, did not outline their allegations specifically enough and that GitHub's Copilot system, which suggests lines of code for programmers, made fair use of the source code.

A spokesperson for GitHub, an online platform for housing code, said Friday that the company has ""been committed to innovating responsibly with Copilot from the start"" and that its motion is ""a testament to our belief in the work we've done to achieve that.""

Representatives for OpenAI and the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday.

Two anonymous plaintiffs, seeking to represent a class of people who own copyrights to code on GitHub, sued Microsoft, GitHub and OpenAI in November. They said the companies trained Copilot with code from GitHub repositories without complying with open-source licensing terms, and that Copilot unlawfully reproduces their code.

Open-source software can be modified or distributed for free by any users who comply with a license, which normally requires attribution to the original creator, notice of their copyright, and a copy of the license, according to the lawsuit.

""Copilot's goal is to replace a huge swath of open source by taking it and keeping it inside a GitHub-controlled paywall,"" the complaint said. ""It violates the licenses that open-source programmers chose and monetizes their code despite GitHub's pledge never to do so.""

Microsoft and OpenAI said Thursday that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the case because they failed to argue they suffered specific injuries from the companies' actions.

The companies also said the lawsuit did not identify particular copyrighted works they misused or contracts that they breached.

Microsoft also said in its filing that the copyright allegations would ""run headlong into the doctrine of fair use,"" which allows the unlicensed use of copyrighted works in some situations. The companies both cited a 2021 U.S. Supreme Court decision that Google's use of Oracle source code to build its Android operating system was transformative fair use.

Microsoft said Monday it would invest billions of dollars in the popular generative AI company OpenAI, which it first backed with $1 billion in 2019.

The source-code case is Doe v. GitHub Inc, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 4:22-cv-06823.

For the plaintiffs: Joseph Saveri, Cadio Zirpoli and Travis Manfredi of the Joseph Saveri Law Firm; Matthew Butterick

643,803,Microsoft,2023-01-27,Why Reed Smith’s leader quit big law for a nonprofit,"













(Reuters) - When big firm leaders step down, it’s usually a carefully choreographed process that includes a prolonged transition.

In part, that’s why I found it so startling to learn this week that Reed Smith’s global managing partner and executive committee chair Alexander “Sandy” Thomas was quitting in the midst of his third four-year term, with barely a month’s notice to the partnership.

Casey Ryan, currently the firm’s global head of legal personnel, will serve the rest of Thomas’ term until the next scheduled election in 2025.

Moreover, Thomas, 56, is not rejoining the ranks to pick up his practice as a litigator – a common move when lawyers who are not of retirement age exit firm leadership.

Instead, he’s leaving 1,700-lawyer Reed Smith effective March 1 to serve as the first chief legal officer of nongovernmental organization Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), an organization founded by Microsoft Corp and Angelina Jolie, which provides legal assistance and social services for unaccompanied refugee and migrant children.

My fundamental question: What prompted such a dramatic career change by the head of one of the top firms in the country, with $1.4 billion in revenue in 2021 and profits per equity partner of $1.7 million?

Thomas wasn’t giving interviews -- too busy working on the annual task of determining compensation for the firm’s 665 partners, a PR rep said -- but he did agree to answer a series of questions via email.

My biggest one, because journalists are naturally suspicious: Did the firm ask him to leave?

“It was my decision alone to leave,” he said.

I asked some of the firm's senior leaders the same question.

“To be clear, the partnership did not ask Sandy to leave the firm. This was solely his decision, and we support him 100%,” Carol Loepere, who chairs the firm’s business and finance department, told me.

“An emphatic absolutely not!” added Tamara Box, managing partner for Europe and the Middle East.

“Sandy’s decision was completely his own,” agreed Douglas Cameron, managing partner for the Americas.

Still, why leave now? Why not wait until his term as chair ended?

Thomas responded, “When I began my new term in June 2021, I fully intended to serve out the full four years. I now have a personal and professional opportunity that I cannot pass up.”

In some ways, that reminds me of his predecessor as Reed Smith chair, Gregory Jordan, who also left mid-term, quitting in 2013 to become general counsel of PNC Financial Services Group.

Jordan told the Pittsburgh Business Times at the time that “the opportunity took me by surprise.”

That’s not quite the case here. Thomas said he became aware of the opportunity at KIND “through a mutual friend of a member of KIND’s leadership,” and that because Reed Smith for years had done pro bono work for the organization, he said, “I was quite familiar with and had admiration for KIND’s mission.”

Reached by email, Jordan said Thomas ""did a great job over the past 10 years leading Reed Smith.”

Thomas called joining KIND “a purpose-led decision.”

“I have enjoyed leading Reed Smith,” he said. “But given where I am in my life and career, I was seeking a change. This opportunity to work at KIND will allow me to do something that is really rewarding and different.”

KIND president Wendy Young said that adding Thomas as the organization's first chief legal officer fills ""a critical role"" for the 15-year-old non-profit. KIND works with more than 755 law firms, corporate, law school and bar associations to provide pro bono representation and other services, according to its website.

Thomas also stressed – and senior firm leaders agreed – that Reed Smith is not being left in the lurch by his departure.

Succession planning began the day he took over as chair 10 years ago, Thomas said, and “that plan is simply executed as soon as a situation like this occurs.”

He added that Ryan, who did not respond to a request for comment, has for years “been playing a lead role in some of the firm’s most consequential business decisions” and is “more than ready” to step in.

Thomas declined to share whether something personal in his life prompted the move – and perhaps that’s none of our business anyway. But he did say he has “always had a desire to be in public service, to give back,” and that after 10 years at the helm of Reed Smith, the timing felt right “to pivot to something that I have long considered and wanted to do.”

He’s not the first big law leader to follow a more altruistic calling. James Sandman spent the first 30 years of his career at Arnold & Porter, where he was managing partner for a decade. He quit in 2007 to become general counsel of the District of Columbia Public Schools, then president of the Legal Services Corp from 2011 to 2020.

Did he ever regret leaving big law?

“Not for a second,” Sandman, now a faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania's Carey Law School, told me. “I feel as if I found my calling later in my career, and I’m glad I did.”

As for the salary cut, Sandman said, “You can be very happy not making millions of dollars a year,” though he conceded that “Some people did think I was crazy.”

“If more people made moves like the one [Thomas] is making,” he added, “I think law would be a happier profession.”

Companies Law firms Morgan, Lewis & Bockius Llp Follow















(Reuters) - U.S. law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius said Monday that it has rehired former National Labor Relations Board chairman John Ring as a partner for its U.S. labor and management relations practice.

Ring, who will be based in Washington, D.C., was chairman of the NLRB from 2018 to January 2021 and was a board member until December 2022. He was appointed to the position of chairman by then-President Donald Trump.

The NLRB is an independent federal agency tasked with policing unfair labor practices and overseeing union elections. The current chair, Lauren McFerran, was appointed by President Joe Biden in January 2021.

Philadelphia-founded Morgan Lewis already had two other NLRB alums in its partnership, including former chairman Philip Miscimarra.

""Employers are dealing with important workplace issues that the NLRB is likely to address very differently in the next two years,"" said Miscimarra, adding that Ring's addition will help guide clients through these changes.

Before his almost five-year government stint, Ring spent nearly 30 years at Morgan Lewis. The firm said he will advise employers on labor-relations strategies, collective bargaining and workforce restructuring.

645,328,Microsoft,2023-01-30,China's Baidu to launch ChatGPT-style bot in March - source,"













BEIJING, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Chinese internet search major Baidu Inc (9888.HK) is planning to launch an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot service similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT in March, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The technology firm plans to launch the service as a standalone application and gradually merge it into its search engine, said the person, who declined to be identified as the information is confidential.

ChatGPT's technology works by learning from vast amounts of data how to answer prompts by users in a human-like manner, offering information like a search engine or even prose like an aspiring novelist.

Chatbots in China currently focus on social interaction whereas ChatGPT performs better at more professional tasks, such as programming and essay writing.

Baidu plans to incorporate chatbot-generated results when users make search requests, instead of only links, the person said.

Baidu declined to comment.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has a $1 billion investment in San Francisco-based OpenAI that it has looked at increasing, Reuters has reported. The company has also worked to add OpenAI's image-generation software to its Bing search engine in a new challenge to Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google.

Beijing-based Baidu has been investing heavily in AI technology, including in cloud services, chips and autonomous driving, as it looks to diversify its revenue sources.

At a developer conference last month, Baidu unveiled three AI-powered ""creators"" whose technology allows them to assume the roles of screenwriter, illustrator, editor or animator.

646,557,Microsoft,2023-01-30,"'They fire, we hire' - Germany seizes on Silicon Valley's woes","













BERLIN, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Faced with a tight labour market and a shortage of workers with key software engineering skills, some German companies are looking at thousands of layoffs in Silicon Valley as an opportunity to recruit top talent.

The U.S. West Coast has always been the main destination for ambitious software engineers looking to work in the best-paid, most elite corner of their profession, but the mass redundancies have created a pool of jobseekers that Germany is eager to tap.

""They fire, we hire,"" said Rainer Zugehoer, Chief People Officer at Cariad, the software subsidiary of automaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE). ""We have several hundred open positions in the U.S., in Europe and in China.""

Spooked by inflation and the prospect of recession, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Facebook owner Meta (META.O) have announced a combined almost 40,000 job cuts.

While Germany is also teetering on the edge of recession, its companies have grown more slowly in recent years and, in a country notorious for still handling business by fax, there are huge technology leaps to be made.

Germany, with one of the world's oldest populations, has gaping holes in its labour force: according to IT industry group Bitkom, 137,000 IT jobs are unfilled.

The government is simplifying immigration rules and dangling the prospect of easily-acquired citizenship to tempt skilled would-be immigrants, and regional authorities are pressing ahead.

""I would like to cordially invite you to move to Bavaria,"" wrote Judith Gerlach, digitalisation minister in Germany's wealthiest region on LinkedIn in a post addressed to the recently laid off.

Especially with the euro at dollar parity, few European companies pay rates that compete with the hundreds of thousands of dollars on offer at California's most successful companies, but some hope cheaper healthcare and lower costs compared to hotspots like San Francisco can help.

""And did I mention Oktoberfest?"" Gerlach added, adding Munich's famed beer festival to the strong labour protections that might prove attractive to the newly jobless.

Some are sceptical, with Bitkom's Bernhard Rohleder noting that Germany is competing not just with other countries for the most talented, but with potential recruits' home countries too.

Germany's penchant for red tape could be another challenge: companies are already reporting months-long delays in securing appointments for their new hires to get work permits.

""Bureaucracy in Germany is utterly crippling for most highly-qualified workers when they first encounter it, especially if they don't speak German,"" said Diana Stoleru of Berlin startup Lendis.

U.S. Dept. of Justice/Handout via REUTERS















BOSTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - A wealthy Russian businessman with ties to the Kremlin made tens of millions of dollars trading on secret financial information obtained by hackers about multiple companies before it was public, a U.S. prosecutor said Monday at the start of his trial.

Vladislav Klyushin, 42, and his associates made nearly $90 million trading stocks based on yet-to-be-announced information about hundreds of publicly-traded companies stolen by hackers, Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Frank told a federal jury in Boston.

""The defendant had tomorrow's news - tomorrow's headlines -today,"" Frank said in his opening statement. ""And he exploited it for tens of millions of dollars in profits.""

Klyushin, whose technology company M-13 did work for Russian President Vladimir Putin's government, personally turned a $2 million investment into $21 million, trading on hacked information and brought other investors into the scheme, Frank said.

The hackers who obtained the information, prosecutors said, include Ivan Ermakov, a former Russian military intelligence officer wanted on separate U.S. charges over allegations he was involved in schemes that interfered with the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Frank did not mention Putin or that election-related case, as a judge has barred reference to it at trial. But he stressed Ermakov worked with Klyushin and his associates to secure ""big money"" through hacked information.

Klyushin has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy, wire fraud, unauthorized access to computers, and securities fraud.

'ZERO EVIDENCE' - DEFENSE

Klyushin's lawyer Maksim Nemtsev countered that the prosecution's case was built on ""gaping holes and inferences.""

He said there was ""zero evidence"" Klyushin ever saw or possessed a stolen earnings report and that instead his client had built up an operation within M-13 to monitor media and gauge investor sentiment that could be used instead for trading.

""There’s nothing illegal about being Russian, about having wealth, about having an IT technology company that contracts with the government,"" Nemtsev told the jury.

The three-week trial coincides with a low point in U.S.-Russia relations following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February last year. The case predates the war, but Klyushin's connections to the Kremlin have long intrigued U.S. authorities.

Klyushin was arrested in Switzerland while on a ski trip in March 2021 and was later extradited. His Swiss lawyer, Oliver Ciric, has said that before his arrest, U.S. and British intelligence agencies had tried to recruit him.

On Monday in court, the prosecutor Frank said that at M-13, Ermakov and others broke into the networks of two firms that help publicly traded companies file reports with securities regulators, Donnelley Financial Solutions (DFIN.N) and Toppan Merrill.

Hackers from 2018 to 2020 viewed and download yet-to-be-announced earnings reports for hundreds of companies including Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), Microsoft Corp and Kohl's, which Klyushin and others used to trade before the news was public, Frank said.

""It wasn’t luck, and it wasn’t because of carefully financial research either,"" Frank said to the jury. ""The defendant cheated.""

648,628,Microsoft,2023-01-30,Philips to cut 13% of jobs in safety and profitability drive,"Summary

Summary Companies Philips to cut another 6,000 jobs

Increases number of layoffs since October to 13% of current workforce

Shares up 5.5% as Q4 results beat expectations















AMSTERDAM, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Dutch health technology company Philips (PHG.AS) will scrap another 6,000 jobs worldwide as it tries to restore its profitability and improve the safety of its products following a recall of respiratory devices that knocked off 70% of its market value.

Half of the job cuts will be made this year, the company said on Monday, adding that the other half will be realised by 2025.

The new reorganisation brings the total amount of job cuts announced by new Chief Executive Roy Jakobs in recent months to 10,000, or around 13% of Philips' current workforce.

It also adds to the string of technology-based firms to make layoffs, after companies including Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and German software maker SAP (SAPG.DE) announced thousands of layoffs to cut costs as they brace for tougher economic conditions.

Philips shares traded up 5.5% at 0855 GMT, helped by fourth-quarter earnings which were much better than expected.

""There is a significant beat on Q4 and the operational improvement measures are very large,"" ING analyst Marc Hesselink said in a note.

Jakobs took over the reins of the company last October, as Philips continued to grapple with the fallout from the recall of millions of ventilators used to treat sleep apnoea over worries that foam used in the machines could become toxic.

""What we present today I think is a very strong plan to secure the future of Philips. The challenges we have are serious and we are adressing them head on,"" Jakobs told reporters.

Jakobs said patient safety would be put ""squarely at the center"" of the new organization.

To improve profitability while investing in safety, innovations will be targeted at ""fewer, better resourced, and more impactful projects"", Jakobs said.

Together this should lead to a low-teens profit margin, as measured by adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA), by 2025, and a mid-to-high-teens margin beyond that year, with mid-single-digit comparable sales growth throughout.

RESULTS IMPROVING, WITH CAUTIOUS OUTLOOK

Amsterdam-based Philips remained cautious in its outlook for the year despite fourth-quarter results that were significantly better than expected.

Adjusted EBITA in the last three months of 2022 came in at 651 million euros ($707.18 million), nearly stable from 647 million euros a year before, while analysts in a company-compiled poll on average had predicted it would drop to 428 million euros.

Comparable sales edged up 3%, instead of the 5% plunge analysts had predicted, as ongoing supply chain problems eased.

But despite the improvement in the shortage of components that has troubled Philips for over a year, Philips said the supply chain remained challenging and would only further improve gradually.

This was expected to lead to low-single-digit comparable sales growth on a high-single-digit margin in 2023, it said.

The outlook excludes the impact of ongoing discussions with the U.S. Department of Justice on a settlement following the recall, and of ongoing litigation and investigations.

649,440,Microsoft,2023-01-31,"Electronic Arts cuts bookings view on 'Star Wars' game delay, spending slowdown","













Jan 31 (Reuters) - Electronic Arts Inc (EA.O) lowered its annual bookings forecast on Tuesday, as the videogame publisher delayed the release of a title based on the ""Star Wars"" franchise and consumers dialed back spending in a sagging economy.

The company's shares fell nearly 7% in extended trading as the results added to last week's grim gaming forecast from Xbox maker Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), fanning fears that a downturn in the industry was set to continue this year.

After two years of pandemic-driven growth, the gaming market fell 4.3% in 2022, according to estimates from analytics firm NewZoo. Some of the drop was due to a lack of big new titles.

EA on Tuesday pushed out the launch of ""Star Wars Jedi: Survivor"" by six weeks to April 28, which would fall into its next fiscal year. The game is a sequel to its 2019 ""Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order"" title that has drawn over 20 million players.

The results, meanwhile, showed that recent launches were not doing enough to draw consumers, who are prioritizing essentials in the face of still-high inflation and rising interest rates.

The company, which in recent months released ""Need for Speed Unbound"" and the latest installment in its ""FIFA"" series, now expects annual bookings between $7.07 billion and $7.17 billion. It had forecast $7.65 billion to $7.85 billion previously.

Its third-quarter adjusted sales and profit also came in below analysts' expectations, according to Refinitiv data.

""Weak, but not a disaster,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said of the results, adding the ""Star Wars"" title delay led to a ""huge shift of earnings"" into next year.

""Demand in free-to-play is down a bit, my best guess is that consumers are freaked out by inflation and fears of a recession,"" he said.

Companies like EA monetize free-to-play games by selling virtual items such as loot boxes and characters to people.

650,540,Microsoft,2023-01-31,EU studying whether Big Tech should pay network costs -EU document,"













BRUSSELS, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The European Union (EU) will consult the technology and telecoms sectors on whether tech giants like Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O), Meta (META.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) should subsidize network costs, according to a Commission document seen by Reuters on Tuesday.

EU telecoms providers including Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), Orange (ORAN.PA), Telefonica (TEF.MC) and Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) say the six largest content providers account for more than half of data internet traffic and should contribute their fair share. The providers also point to Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

The tech giants say the idea is equivalent to an internet traffic tax that could interfere with Europe's net neutrality rules treating all users equally.

The commission's query is part of a 19-page document the EU executive drafted before it proposes legislation.

The EU executive is expected to publish the document next week to garner feedback from telecoms operators and Big Tech, although the timing may change. The next step is an agreement with EU countries and lawmakers to finalise the legislation.

""Some stakeholders have suggested a mandatory mechanism of direct payments from CAPs (content application providers)/LTGs (large traffic generator) to contribute to finance network deployment. Do you support such suggestion and if so why? If no, why not?"" the questionnaire asked.

The questionnaire also asks who the mechanism should apply t; whether it would negatively impact innovation, the internet ecosystem and consumers; and whether the EU should create a continental or digital levy or fund.

The EU will also query Big Tech and telecoms providers' investment spending and future developments, confirming a Reuters story this month.

""The Commission's questionnaire is basically asking questions that seek to justify the 'fair share' narrative pushed by big telcos. What is more, it seems to ignore the impact on consumers and fundamental net neutrality protections,"" an industry source said.

""The Commission is also asking for detailed business information, such as peering contracts, that is usually confidential. This effectively excludes key stakeholders from taking part.

DETROIT, Jan 31 (Reuters) - General Motors Co (GM.N) shares jumped early on Tuesday after it reported higher net income for the fourth quarter, forecast stronger-than-expected earnings for 2023 and said it would cut $2 billion in costs.

The automaker, the top in the United States by sales, forecast that it could hold its pre-tax margins steady between 8% and 10% through 2025, despite a price war that Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) has triggered in the electric vehicle segment.

GM shares opened up 7.1%.

GM plans to build only about 400,000 electric vehicles in North America between now and the first half of 2024. Its financial results will hinge mainly on sales of combustion-engine trucks and SUVs.

GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said she does not see a need to cut prices on GM's electric vehicles in response to Tesla. ""Right now based on the interest we're seeing, the pricing we put out was very appropriate,"" Barra told analysts during a call Tuesday.

For now and for several years to come, GM's profitability will be driven by demand for those vehicles - a reality GM highlighted in its presentation to investors. GM underscored that its Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks make it No. 1 in sales volume in the U.S. market, and it leads in sales of highly profitable large SUVs as well.

GM's outlook ""sets a high bar for this year,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note. Jonas said GM expects to boost revenue over a period when other legacy automakers' revenues could shrink.

""We question whether the company will be able to self-fund such spending plans in a higher rate, slower growth environment,"" Jonas wrote.

COST CUTS

The company plans to cut costs in automotive operations by $2 billion this year and next year, including reducing employment through attrition, Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson told reporters on a call on Tuesday, but does not plan layoffs. Big technology firms including Amazon, Google and Microsoft have rattled markets by announcing thousands of job cuts.

GM has 167,000 employees worldwide, including its financial subsidiary and the Cruise robotaxi unit.

Jacobson said the U.S. vehicle market remained robust, and the automaker forecast U.S. car and light truck sales will rise in 2023 to 15 million vehicles from 13.9 million last year.

Jacobson expressed little concern about the potential impact of recent price cuts by Tesla and Ford Motor Co (F.N) on popular electric vehicle models.

""We see incredibly strong demand with the pricing strategy we’ve gone to market with,"" Jacobson said.

EV price cuts shouldn’t affect pricing for GM’s combustion vehicles, he said. The upbeat forecast from GM cheered investors, who sent the automaker's shares up 5% in premarket trading.

GM expects consistent strength in its core auto operations in 2023, with full-year operating earnings in the range of $10.5 billion to $12.5 billion, or $6.00-$7.00 a share. Analysts had expected $5.73 a share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

For 2022, GM's operating profit reached a record $14.5 billion.

In the fourth quarter, GM earned $2 billion, up from $1.7 billion the previous year, as higher prices and increased sales volume in North America more than offset higher costs.

Operating earnings per share of $2.12 in the quarter compared with $1.99 a year earlier. Analysts had predicted $1.69.

GM's average vehicle selling price in North America hit a record $51,000 in 2022, as the company focused production on more expensive, higher-margin vehicles.

GM said capital spending will range between $11 billion and $13 billion in 2023, up from $9 billion in 2022.

Ahead of the earnings release, the automaker said it would invest $650 million in Lithium Americas and jointly develop a lithium mine in Nevada that it says is the largest known source of the key battery material in the United States.

The company expects revenue from electric vehicles to reach $50 billion in 2025 -- about 22% of total revenue -- with pre-tax margins in the low to mid-single digits.

Cruise lost $1.9 billion in 2022, and GM expects losses to increase as the unit expands to more cities in 2023.

REUTERS/Charles Platiau















CHICAGO/DETROIT, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The companies that produce goods at the heart of the U.S. consumer economy - SUVs, washing machines, heavy equipment and hamburgers - kept rolling along at the end of 2022.

But corporate executives on conference calls were guarded in their comments on Tuesday, noting solid demand while simultaneously pointing to the need to hold costs down in the face of higher inflation and expectations for economic growth to moderate - but not collapse.

""We're not doing anything in anticipation of a recession,"" said General Motors Co (GM.N) Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson told analysts on a call, after the company posted better-than-expected results and forecast a more upbeat 2023 than analysts expected. ""Consumer demand is still holding up.""

Bellwethers including McDonald's Corp (MCD.N), GM, Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), appliance maker Whirlpool Corp (WHR.N) and delivery giant United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) posted results that exceeded estimates.

Right now, S&P 500 companies have reported a 4.5% year-over-year rise in revenue. That exceeds what was expected on Jan. 1, but is short of the previous year's double-digit growth rates, and it is expected to slow in the first half of 2023, according to Refinitiv, motivating the cautious outlook.

""We want to be cautious. That’s why we are talking about a $2 billion cost-cutting program,"" said GM's Jacobson, who said those cuts are planned over two years.

GM is not alone. Exxon also said it would cut spending even after reporting a record $56 billion profit in 2022, and UPS exceeded estimates due in part to reducing expenses.

OPTIMISM ABOUT ECONOMY

However, the hundreds of thousands of technology job layoffs announced by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O) and others are not being mirrored in the rest of the economy. That is a good sign for the broader economy, according to Lori Calvasina, equity analyst at RBC Capital Markets.

""We are optimistic this condition can remain in place given the strong levels of demand and backlogs that we continue to hear about from publicly traded industrial companies,"" she wrote on Monday. Calvasina said the market's recent performance may reflect expectations for a mild downturn followed by a solid recovery in 2024.

The S&P 500 is up 4.6% in January, the best first month for the index since 2019. U.S. economic growth came in at a better-than-expected 2.9% rate for the fourth quarter. It is early, but the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank's first-quarter GDP estimate is currently 0.7%.

The economy's performance may depend on whether price pressures that have afflicted consumer and business spending start to wane. There is some evidence of that, as the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose at a 5% year-over-year rate in December, the lowest since September 2021.

Still, that rate is pressuring margins, numerous executives said on Tuesday. Whirlpool Corp CEO Marc Bitzer said that ""inflationary pressures remained stubbornly high"" during the fourth quarter, and Caterpillar executives suggested pricing pressures will continue, after saying on the previous earnings call they expected them to moderate. Caterpillar Inc's (CAT.N) fourth-quarter earnings dropped by 29%.

Even so, the feeling around the economy itself remains relatively positive.

""As we go into 2023, there is going to continue to be inflation,"" said Christopher Kempczinski, McDonald's CEO, on the company's earnings call on Tuesday. ""Do you reach a point where maybe it does start to materialize around the consumer? Certainly, consumer sentiment out there remains depressed in many markets. But we're not seeing it right now.""

653,192,Microsoft,2023-02-01,ChatGPT sets record for fastest-growing user base - analyst note,"













Feb 1 (Reuters) - ChatGPT, the popular chatbot from OpenAI, is estimated to have reached 100 million monthly active users in January, just two months after launch, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history, according to a UBS study on Wednesday.

The report, citing data from analytics firm Similarweb, said an average of about 13 million unique visitors had used ChatGPT per day in January, more than double the levels of December.

""In 20 years following the internet space, we cannot recall a faster ramp in a consumer internet app,"" UBS analysts wrote in the note.

It took TikTok about nine months after its global launch to reach 100 million users and Instagram 2-1/2 years, according to data from Sensor Tower.

ChatGPT can generate articles, essays, jokes and even poetry in response to prompts. OpenAI, a private company backed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), made it available to the public for free in late November.

On Thursday, OpenAI announced a $20 monthly subscription, initially for users in the United States only. It would provide a more stable and faster service as well as the opportunity to try new features first, the company said.

Analysts believe the viral launch of ChatGPT will give OpenAI a first-mover advantage against other AI companies. The growing usage, while imposing substantial computing cost on OpenAI, has also provided valuable feedback to help train the chatbot's responses.

The company said the subscription revenue would help cover the computing cost.

Availability of the tool has raised questions about facilitation of academic dishonesty and misinformation.

Last month, Microsoft announced another multi-billion-dollar investment in OpenAI in the form of cash and provision of cloud computing.

654,518,Microsoft,2023-02-01,"Exclusive: EU may miss gigabit target, more investments needed, telecoms group says","













BRUSSELS, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The European Union risks missing its target to connect all European households to a gigabit network by 2030, underscoring the need for more investments, according to a study commissioned by telecoms lobbying group ETNO.

The study by Analysys Mason comes as the bloc considers the possibility of getting Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O), Meta (META.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Netflix (NFLX.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) to bear some of the network costs.

Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), Orange (ORAN.PA), Telefonica (TEF.MC), Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) and their peers say this should be seen as a fair share contribution from the six content providers which account for more than half of data internet traffic.

Big Tech sees it as an internet traffic tax at odds with EU net neutrality rules treating all users equally, saying that they also invest in their own content delivery networks.

Total telecom investment in Europe peaked at 56.3 billion euros in 2021, the highest since 2016, but still lagged behind other regions, the report said.

""Europe continues to trail its peers worldwide in terms of telecoms investment. Investment per capita adjusted to GDP was 104 euros in Europe in 2021 compared with 260 euros in Japan, 150 euros in the United States and 110 euros in China,"" the study said.

""More investment capacity is needed to accelerate innovation, but the established current trends place additional pressure on many operators to sell or separate service and innovation-related assets,"" it said.

The study also noted the large gap between the returns on investment for telecoms operators and those for Big Tech.

""There is an acute discrepancy between the returns on investment in European telecoms infrastructure and the returns on investment of the largest services that run over this infrastructure,"" it said.

""When it comes to internet access, it is telecoms operators that shoulder the investment burden, while in terms of new value creation it is tech companies that benefit the most.""

655,417,Microsoft,2023-02-01,Tinder owner to lay off 8% of its staff as growth falters,"[1/2] Match Group logo and stock graph are seen in this illustration taken, May 1, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration















Feb 1 (Reuters) - Match Group Inc (MTCH.O) on Wednesday joined a growing list of U.S. companies that are cutting jobs to rein in costs after it announced plans to lay off about 8% of its workforce, or about 200 employees, as spending on its dating apps slows.

The company gave a lackluster quarterly revenue forecast a day earlier that it blamed on a tough economy, a strong dollar and ""significant"" poor product execution at Tinder. Product delays have also hit its Hinge app at a time when competition is rising from rival Bumble Inc (BMBL.O).

The job cuts were mainly in areas such as recruiting, the company said in an email. The cuts have already taken place in the United States and are being implemented in other countries.

Match incurred about $3 million in severance and similar costs during the fourth quarter and said it was expecting additional costs of about $6 million in 2023. It said the moves would help improve margins in the second half of the year.

Shares of Texas-based Match were down 7.7%.

The layoffs come as other tech firms from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) shed tens of thousands of jobs to brace for a possible recession.

""In addition to the cuts, we expect Match to place greater emphasis on marketing its Tinder and Hinge brands, core areas of growth for 2023,"" CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said.

Match, which has primarily relied on word-of-mouth advertising, said Tinder will be launching its first global marketing campaign in the current quarter to improve brand perception.

It forecast first-quarter revenue between $790 million and $800 million, lower than analysts' estimates of $817.3 million, according to Refinitiv data. The company also reported its first-ever quarterly revenue decline.

656,790,Microsoft,2023-02-01,End of easy-cash era is going to hurt,"













LONDON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - (This Feb. 1 story has been corrected to fix the name of CIO in the ""Going Private"" section to Nicoll from Nicole)

The end of the easy-cash era is over and its impact yet to be felt on world markets, hopeful that the pain of aggressive rate hikes and high inflation has passed.

U.S. and UK central banks are unwinding stimulus further by offloading bonds they hold, and the European Central Bank will join them soon. Nomura estimates the balance sheets of the three banks will shrink by $3 trillion this year.

Reuters Graphics

Tech stocks and crypto currencies look vulnerable. They are among risky assets that soared as cash pumped out by central banks fighting weak inflation in recent years searched for a home.

""When you have unprecedented monetary tightening, the likelihood is that you get issues that are uncovered – that might be something hidden such as liquidity or something more obvious like pressures in the housing market,"" said Zurich Insurance Group chief market strategist Guy Miller.

We look at some potential pressure points.

1/ DARLINGS NO MORE

Once darlings of the easy-cash era, tech stocks are being shunned by many investors even after a January bounce as higher rates make it more expensive to take punts on the potential earnings growth of early stage or speculative businesses.

When economic uncertainty is high, investors often look for reliable returns from dividends to safeguard portfolios. That makes the likes of tech stalwarts such as Apple (AAPL.O), whose shares trade on a dividend yield of less than 1%, look vulnerable.

""We're at a stage where very elevated valuations in markets have collided with much less supportive policy,"" said James Harries, senior fund manager at Troy Asset Management. ""So, the outlook is darkening.""

Tech firms are reversing pandemic-era exuberance, cutting jobs after years of hiring sprees. Google owner Alphabet plans to axe about 12,000 workers; Microsoft, Amazon and Meta are firing almost 40,000.

2/ DEFAULT RISKS

Concerns about corporate defaults are mounting as rates rise, although recession worries have eased.

S&P Global said Europe had the second-highest default count last year since 2009.

It expects U.S. and European default rates to reach 3.75% and 3.25%, respectively, in September 2023 versus 1.6% and 1.4% a year before, with pessimistic forecasts of 6.0% and 5.5% not ""out of the question.""

Man GLG portfolio manager Michael Scott said markets have not fully priced in the risk of higher defaults.

Reuters Graphics

3/ GOING PRIVATE

Private debt markets have ballooned since the financial crisis to $1.4 trillion from $250 billion in 2010.

The largely floating-rate nature of the financing appeals to investors, who can reap returns in high single to low double digits, and became popular as plunging rates post-2008 boosted risk assets.

Now, a reality check: higher rates imply a heavier burden for companies as recession looms, casting a shadow over their ability to generate sufficient cash to pay ballooning interest costs.

""What surprises me is that you're almost back to complacency,"" said Will Nicoll, CIO of Private and Alternative Assets at M&G Investments. ""We’ve gone from a position where three months ago everybody was talking about a credit cycle coming through for the first time in decades and now people appear to have forgotten that.""

4/CRYPTO WINTER

Rising borrowing costs roiled crypto markets in 2022. The price of bitcoin plunged 64% and around $1.3 trillion was wiped off the global cryptocurrency market cap.

Bitcoin has rallied recently but caution remains. The collapse of various dominant crypto companies, most notably FTX, left investors shouldering large losses and prompted calls for more regulation.

January brought a fresh wave of job cuts as firms brace for the so-called crypto winter, while the lending unit of Genesis recently filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection, owing creditors at least $3.4 billion.

5/FOR SALE

Real estate markets, first responders to rate hikes, started cracking last year and 2023 will be tough with U.S. house prices expected to drop 12%.

Fund managers surveyed by BofA see China's troubled real estate sector as the second most likely source of a credit event.

European real estate is reporting distress levels not seen since 2012, according to data from law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges.

How the sector services its debt is in focus and officials warn European banks risk significant profit hits from sliding house prices.

Real estate investment management firm AEW estimates the UK, France and Germany could face a 24 billion euro debt funding gap through 2025. Luckily, bank balance sheets are better positioned to absorb losses, so few expect a 2008 repeat.

657,338,Microsoft,2023-02-02,U.S. layoffs surged in January as tech slashed thousands of jobs - report,"













Feb 2 (Reuters) - Layoffs in the United States hit a more than two-year high in January as technology firms cut jobs at the second-highest pace on record to brace for a possible recession, a report showed on Thursday.

The layoffs impacted 102,943 workers, a more than two-fold jump from December and an over five-times surge from a year earlier, according to the report from employment firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc.

Reuters Graphics

Companies from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) cut thousands of jobs last month in a bid to ride out a demand downturn as consumer and corporate spending shrinks due to high inflation and rising interest rates.

""We're now on the other side of the hiring frenzy of the pandemic years,"" said Andrew Challenger, labor expert and Senior Vice President of the employment firm. ""Companies are preparing for an economic slowdown, cutting workforce and slowing hiring.""

The push to correct pandemic excesses has been most evident in the tech sector, which slashed 41,829 jobs last month, the highest across industries.

Reuters Graphics

Retailers, second after tech, cut 13,000 positions in January, compared with virtually no layoffs a year earlier. Financial firms, meanwhile, shed 10,603 jobs last month, up from 696 roles a year earlier.

With the Federal Reserve expected to continue on its rate-hiking path to stamp down inflation that is still on the higher side after several rounds of rate increases, analysts said more layoffs could be in store for U.S. companies.

""For companies that ramped up headcount over the past few years, they will likely shrink their workforce as the economy is headed towards a rough patch,"" OANDA analyst Edward Moya said.

TOKYO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Sony Group Corp (6758.T) has nudged up its annual profit forecast, helped by a strong showing for its videogame division, and raised its PlayStation 5 game console sales target by one million units to 19 million for the year to March.

The electronics and entertainment giant also said its chief financial officer, Hiroki Totoki, would become president and chief operating officer from April 1, while retaining his current role.

Incumbent president Kenichiro Yoshida will remain as chairman and chief executive officer.

""I'm obsessed with growth. Any businesses and companies tend to go into a negative spiral if growth stalls,"" Totoki told a news conference on Thursday.

""By realising growth, I would like to create a positive spiral where we are chosen by customers and our employees are energised.""

The company said it now expects operating profit for the year to March 31 to total 1.18 trillion yen ($9.17 billion), up 1.7% from its previous forecast of 1.16 trillion yen.

That remains short of analysts' average estimate of a 1.19 trillion yen profit, according to Refinitiv data, and just shy of a record profit of 1.2 trillion yen posted a year earlier.

Sony said sales of its Playstation 5 consoles came to 7.1 million units in the October-December quarter, which overlaps with the critical year-end shopping season, up sharply from 3.9 million units a year earlier.

""Various steps we have been taking on both the hardware and software sides are steadily bearing fruit. I believe we are generating positive momentum to re-accelerate growth in our game operations,"" Totoki said.

Sony, which competes with Xbox maker Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Switch provider Nintendo Co Ltd (7974.T) in the game sector, struggled last year to produce enough PlayStation 5 units due to supply chain snarls.

Totoki said risks associated with supply chains have not been resolved yet, and the company boosted game console production sharply in the October-December quarter so it can safely meet demand in the current quarter.

For October-December, Sony posted a 7.8% fall in operating profit as its film division fared worse than a year ago, when a blockbuster ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" movie drove its profit.

659,753,Microsoft,2023-02-02,Alphabet disappoints on sales as ad business slips after pandemic run-up,"













Feb 2 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) on Thursday posted fourth-quarter profit and sales short of Wall Street expectations as Google's advertising clients pulled back spending from a period of pandemic-led excess.

Executives of the search and advertising giant adopted a subdued tone on a call with investors, promising an extended period of belt-tightening, particularly on hiring, real estate costs and experimental projects that can take years to reach fruition.

Shares of Alphabet were down nearly 5% in after-hours trading, after losing about 40% of their value in 2022.

""We are committed to investing responsibly with great discipline and defining areas where we can operate more cost- effectively,"" Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts on a call to discuss the company's results. That echoed comments from Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) boss Mark Zuckerberg the previous day on cost efficiencies.

Shares of other tech companies Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) also fell after they posted disappointing results on Thursday, wiping off gains after Facebook parent Meta on Wednesday boosted tech shares with news on cost cuts and a large buyback.

Gone was some of the exuberance of the pandemic when consumers flocked to the internet amid lockdowns and heightened interest in e-commerce and touchless deliveries.

Alphabet's chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, promised a more measured approach for 2023 and a focus on ""delivering sustainable financial value,"" not necessarily a hallmark of Silicon Valley firms. ""We're focused on revenue upside as well as durable changes to the expense base.""

Advertisers, who contribute the bulk of Alphabet's sales, have cut their budgets as rising inflation and interest rates fueled concern over consumer spending.

Pichai pointed to advertisers' more modest spending and the impact of foreign exchange rates abroad as drags on Alphabet's overall results.

He said artificial intelligence (AI) software will be an important focus for the company and that it plans to make its LaMDA chatbot software publicly available in the coming weeks.

LID ON COSTS

Mountain View, California-based Alphabet decided to cut 12,000 jobs last month, representing about 6% of its overall workforce, and said it was doubling down on AI. Across the company, Alphabet will ""meaningfully"" slow its pace of hiring this year, said Porat.

Alphabet, long a leader in AI, is facing competition from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), which is reportedly looking to boost its stake in ChatGPT - a promising chatbot that answers queries with human-like responses.

""Despite being seen as one of the most insulated companies in the advertising space relative to peers, Alphabet's poor quarter is the latest sign that worsening fundamentals and a tough macroeconomic environment are prompting advertisers to cut back on spending,"" said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.

Net income fell to $13.62 billion, or $1.05 per share, from $20.64 billion, or $1.53 per share, a year earlier. That was the sharpest decline for Alphabet in four quarters.

Adjusted profit of $1.05 per share fell short of an expected $1.18 per share, according to Refinitiv.

Revenue from Google advertising, which includes Search and YouTube, fell 3.6% to $59.04 billion. Total revenue rose 1% to $76.05 billion, its slowest growth ever barring a small decline in the second quarter of 2020. Analysts were expecting $76.53 billion.

Google is the world's largest digital ad platform by market share, making it uniquely susceptible to fluctuations in online marketing spending. Its YouTube division has faced a surge in rival platforms, particularly TikTok, whose endless scroll of short video is drawing younger users away.

Alphabet's Porat said the company's total capital expenses this year will be in line with last year. As more of its employees work remotely and it consolidates staff, Alphabet expects to pare back its real estate expenses, which Porat said would result in a charge of roughly a half-billion dollars in this year's first three months.

Revenue from YouTube ads, one of Alphabet's most consistent money-makers, fell nearly 8% to $7.96 billion, well below the estimate of $8.25 billion, according to FactSet.

Cloud was a bright spot, however, with revenue growing 32% to $7.32 billion, but at its slowest pace since the company began disclosing the segment's revenue numbers.

But there may be more pain ahead for Alphabet. Late last month, the Justice Department and eight states sued Google over what they said were anticompetitive practices in its digital ad sales. The company is facing multiple lawsuits, which, if successful, could cause it to be broken up.

Feb 2 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) on Thursday said its operating profit could fall to zero in the current quarter as savings from layoffs do not make up for the financial impact of consumers and cloud customers clamping down on spending.

And while Amazon's holiday revenue beat Wall Street's expectations, the company believes sales growth in its long-lucrative cloud business will slow for the next few quarters, its chief financial officer told reporters.

Shares fell 5% in after-hours trade, erasing most of their 7% gain before the market's close Thursday.

Making a rare appearance on Amazon's quarterly call with financial analysts, Chief Executive Andy Jassy said ""virtually every enterprise"" was treading carefully on cloud and other costs in light of economic uncertainty.

""We're going to help our customers find a way to spend less money,"" he said. ""We're trying to build a set of relationships in business that outlasts all of us.""

Facing high inflation and recession fears, Jassy has embarked on extensive cost-cutting inside Amazon as well.

Last month, the online retailer said more than 18,000 employees particularly in its commerce and human resources divisions would lose their jobs. It booked a $640 million severance charge in the fourth quarter, CFO Brian Olsavsky told reporters.

Amazon likewise has scaled back or shut down entire services like its virtual primary care offering for employers. It took another $720 million charge from closing or impairing assets of some grocery stores, among other items, believing it has yet to find the right formula in its long-running supermarket bet.

""We're not going to expand the physical Fresh stores until we have that equation, with differentiation and economic value that we like, but we're optimistic that we're going to find that in 2023,"" Jassy said.

Despite this cost-cutting, Amazon forecast it would earn between $0 and $4 billion in operating income this quarter, compared with $3.7 billion in the same period a year prior and $4.04 billion that analysts were expecting, according to research firm FactSet.

Olsavsky attributed this to sales growth easing in the cloud, as well as brands pouring money into Amazon ads more slowly now that the holiday shopping season is over. Retail demand is another factor.

""We remain nervous as everyone else is about the consumer spending and ... how people will prioritize their budgets moving forward,"" he said.

VALUE SHOPPING

An October sale to encourage early holiday shopping on Amazon has helped with retail revenue, to a point.

The company's total net sales were $149.2 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with analysts' expectations of $145.4 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Consumer spending, however, shifted more to value brands in some categories and a greater percentage of sales in home essentials, Olsavsky said.

Demand in Europe and the United Kingdom was also hurt by high inflation and the Ukraine war, lowering international growth rates, he said.

Amazon has sought new revenue in the meanwhile. The company plans to charge certain grocery delivery fees for U.S. Prime members, on top of recent price hikes to join the loyalty program; it has created an add-on generic-drug subscription to attract business as well.

Still, its outlook is particularly tied to the fortunes of its cloud-computing division.

Andrew Lipsman, an analyst at Insider Intelligence, called slower growth in cloud and ads ""a drag on profits going forward.""

Tech industry executives, including at rival Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), have said economic uncertainty has prompted enterprises to rethink how much they're willing to spend on cloud.

While AWS is helping customers navigate such terrain, it still has a healthy deal flow and future commitments from customers, making the company optimistic, Amazon CFO Olsavsky said.

But ""points of weakness"" in cloud included financial services as mortgage volumes are down, and there has been less trading in cryptocurrency, he said.

For now, the division fell short of estimates of more than $22 billion in fourth-quarter cloud sales. They increased 20% to $21.4 billion.

661,15,Microsoft,2023-02-02,Microsoft rolls out ChatGPT-powered Teams Premium,"













Feb 1 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Wednesday rolled out a premium Teams messaging offering powered by ChatGPT to simplify meetings using the AI chatbot that has taken Silicon Valley by a storm.

The premium service will cost $7 per month in June before increasing to $10 in July, Microsoft said.

OpenAI-owned ChatGPT will generate automatic meeting notes, recommend tasks and help create meeting templates for Teams users.

Microsoft, which announced a multi-billion dollar investment in OpenAI earlier this month, has said it aims to add ChatGPT's technology into all its products, setting the stage for more competition with rival Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google.

The chatbot, which can produce prose or poetry on command, is at the forefront of generative AI, a space where more and more big tech companies are funneling their resources in.

ChatGPT on Wednesday announced a $20 per-month subscription plan, which will let subscribers receive access to faster responses and priority access to new features and improvements.

662,618,Microsoft,2023-02-02,Apple tries to be both desirable and predictable,"













NEW YORK, Feb 2 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Companies from General Electric (GE.N) to Goldman Sachs (GS.N) know one key to a higher stock-market valuation is producing recurring, stable, fee-like revenue. The same goes for Apple (AAPL.O). The $2.4 trillion iPhone maker’s shift from devices to less tangible services, which made up 18% of its revenue in the latest quarter, has pushed up its valuation. But not all of its offerings are equally valuable.

As Apple has shifted toward more services, its desirability has risen. In 2018, the company’s enterprise value was equivalent to 3 times estimated revenue for the year ahead, according to Refinitiv. Today, at $2.5 trillion including net debt, Chief Executive Tim Cook presides over a firm valued at 6 times sales.

One way to make sense of that is to break Apple’s valuation into parts. Analysts assume Apple will sell about $300 billion in iPhones and other objects this year. While the devices have changed, the business hasn’t much, so assume that chunk of business is worth around 5 times sales – still handsomely above Apple’s historical average – or around $1.5 trillion. Deduct that from Apple’s enterprise value, and investors are pricing the services business at $1 trillion, around 10 times forecast revenue.

That’s more than Microsoft (MSFT.O), which trades at 8 times and whose revenue growth is similar and remarkably consistent. Whether it’s justified, though, depends on what services Apple is peddling, and how steady and subscription-like they are. Gaming and advertising, for example, may become blockbuster businesses, but are more impacted by economic weakness than music subscriptions or cloud backup.

Apple doesn’t break out how much revenue comes from what source, but it matters. Cyclical services are typically valued less richly, even if they are growing quickly. Alphabet (GOOGL.O), the ad-dependent parent of Google, and gaming company Electronic Arts (EA.O) are both valued at 4 times estimated sales. If 20% of Apple’s services are cyclical, for example, and investors put the same multiple of sales as those peers, the company's fair share price drops 5%.

That may sound like splitting hairs. But it isn’t, because services are an ever-greater part of Apple’s business: nearly a fifth of revenue today compared with less than 10% in 2015. Apple might be reluctant to disclose more, since regulators like European antitrust cop Margrethe Vestager are out to inject competition into digital markets. But if there’s one thing investors prize along with predictability, it’s transparency.

663,211,Microsoft,2023-02-03,Exclusive: ChatGPT in spotlight as EU's Breton bats for tougher AI rules,"













BRUSSELS/STOCKHOLM, Feb 3 (Reuters) - EU industry chief Thierry Breton has said new proposed artificial intelligence rules will aim to tackle concerns about the risks around the ChatGPT chatbot and AI technology, in the first comments on the app by a senior Brussels official.

Just two months after its launch, ChatGPT - which can generate articles, essays, jokes and even poetry in response to prompts - has been rated the fastest-growing consumer app in history.

Some experts have raised fears that systems used by such apps could be misused for plagiarism, fraud and spreading misinformation, even as champions of artificial intelligence hail it as a technological leap.

Breton said the risks posed by ChatGPT - the brainchild of OpenAI, a private company backed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) - and AI systems underscored the urgent need for rules which he proposed last year in a bid to set the global standard for the technology. The rules are currently under discussion in Brussels.

""As showcased by ChatGPT, AI solutions can offer great opportunities for businesses and citizens, but can also pose risks. This is why we need a solid regulatory framework to ensure trustworthy AI based on high-quality data,"" he told Reuters in written comments.

Microsoft declined to comment on Breton's statement. OpenAI - whose app uses a technology called generative AI - did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

OpenAI has said on its website it aims to produce artificial intelligence that ""benefits all of humanity"" as it attempts to build safe and beneficial AI.

Under the EU draft rules, ChatGPT is considered a general purpose AI system which can be used for multiple purposes including high-risk ones such as the selection of candidates for jobs and credit scoring.

Breton wants OpenAI to cooperate closely with downstream developers of high-risk AI systems to enable their compliance with the proposed AI Act.

""Just the fact that generative AI has been newly included in the definition shows the speed at which technology develops and that regulators are struggling to keep up with this pace,"" a partner at a U.S. law firm, said.

'HIGH RISK' WORRIES

Companies are worried about getting their technology classified under the ""high risk"" AI category which would lead to tougher compliance requirements and higher costs, according to executives of several companies involved in developing artificial intelligence.

A survey by industry body appliedAI showed that 51% of the respondents expect a slowdown of their AI development activities as a result of the AI Act.

Effective AI regulations should centre on the highest risk applications, Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote in a blog post on Wednesday.

""There are days when I'm optimistic and moments when I'm pessimistic about how humanity will put AI to use,"" he said.

Breton said the European Commission is working closely with the EU Council and European Parliament to further clarify the rules in the AI Act for general purpose AI systems.

""People would need to be informed that they are dealing with a chatbot and not with a human being. Transparency is also important with regard to the risk of bias and false information,"" he said.

Generative AI models need to be trained on huge amount of text or images for creating a proper response leading to allegations of copyright violations.

Breton said forthcoming discussions with lawmakers about AI rules would cover these aspects.

Concerns about plagiarism by students have prompted some U.S. public schools and French university Sciences Po to ban the use of ChatGPT.

664,757,Microsoft,2023-02-03,Tech earnings hit pause button on market rally,"













Feb 3 (Reuters) - Big Tech led U.S. markets on a sharp rebound to kick off 2023. The message from their earnings on Thursday: not so fast.

Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) all posted results for the end-of-year quarter that left a sour taste in investors' mouths. The reports renewed questions about global economic demand, the effect of higher interest rates and whether the market's January rally got ahead of itself.

Nascent signs that consumer spending was beginning to rebound in China were not enough to change that.

Apple, the world's largest publicly traded company, fell short of expectations, hurt by lower iPhone sales and production disruptions in China. Amazon said operating profits could fall this quarter due to lower demand, and Alphabet's online advertisers cut back their spend as well.

Shares of Amazon dropped about 5%, while Alphabet retreated nearly 2%, on course to collectively shed nearly $93 billion from their respectively market valuations. Apple reversed early losses to trade 3.5% higher.

""Maybe the tech stocks rallied a little bit too much into these numbers, so the market will be taking a deep breath and saying, 'OK, well these companies aren't bulletproof,'"" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta, Georgia.

These three firms and Microsoft (MSFT.O), the four U.S. companies with trillion-dollar market values, have led the broad-market S&P 500 in 2023. The index is up nearly 9% year-to-date, with Amazon gaining 34%. Big Tech surged Thursday following a strong quarterly report from Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc (META.O).

That's after the group was battered throughout 2022, trailing the S&P, which dropped nearly 20%.

David Trainer, chief executive of New Constructs in Nashville, Tennessee, said not enough people in the market are paying attention to company fundamentals.

""We're in a speculator's market, not an investor's,"" he said, noting recent trading in retailer Bed Bath & Beyond, which is expected to file for bankruptcy soon. ""What we've seen in January and late December was a huge increase in liquidity and a return to the meme stock way.""

Some investors saw silver linings from Apple and other bellwethers, including Starbucks, that reported results on Thursday. They noted that lockdowns in China strangled sales for many companies in the world's second-biggest economy, expecting a rebound in the coming year.

""When things started to reopen in December (in China), we did see an increase in traffic to our stores as compared to November and an increase in demand as December rolled around,"" Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters.

Cook said lockdowns in China hurt both production and demand, and the company faced headwinds from the strong U.S. dollar that pushed revenues lower.

""Currency was a headwind but will be a tailwind in Q1,” said Nancy Tengler, chief executive of Laffer Tengler Investments in Scottsdale, Arizona, referring to the dollar's weakening trajectory.

""The supply chain was a problem more so than demand, and that seems to have been right-sized.""

Similarly, Starbucks said comparable sales fell 29% from the previous year in China, the company's fastest-growing market, but that beginning in January, it saw ""very encouraging"" recovery momentum there.

Other U.S. consumer bellwethers painted a mixed picture. Consumer staples giant Clorox said product volumes fell in three of the company's four business segments in the fourth quarter, while automaker Ford said the year ahead was going to be a difficult one.

They, and other companies, are still grappling with higher interest rates that are slowing demand. This year's surge in stocks has been built on a rally in bonds, as lower yields make high-valuation shares more attractive. Cost-cutting by Alphabet and Meta led some investors to think that interest rates are affecting demand.

""In many respects we're waiting for that other shoe to drop – the impact of higher rates on the economy, inflation, earnings and jobs,"" said Jack Ablin, co-founder and chief investment officer at Cresset Capital, which manages $30 billion. ""Profits tend to trough nine months after overnight rates peak and we haven't even seen the peak in overnight rates yet.""

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) has agreed to pay $35 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it failed to have systems in place to properly handle disclosures of employee complaints and violated whistleblower protection rules, the regulator said on Friday.

The SEC said the company knew employee retention issues were ""a particularly important risk in its business"" but did not have adequate measures in place to manage workplace misconduct complaints across business units between 2018 and 2021.

""Activision Blizzard failed to implement necessary controls to collect and review employee complaints about workplace misconduct, which left it without the means to determine whether larger issues existed that needed to be disclosed to investors,” Jason Burt, who heads the SEC's Denver office, said in a statement.

The video game developer and publishing company, which makes the popular ""Call of Duty"" game, also required employees between 2016 and 2021 to tell the company if the SEC contacted them for information - a violation of whistleblower protection rules, the agency said in the statement.

Representatives for Activision Blizzard, which did not admit or deny the SEC's charges, said in a statement they were ""pleased to have amicably resolved this matter"" and had ""enhanced"" their workplace reporting and contract language.

The company made changes between May 2020 and May 2022 that enhanced the way complaints were collected and communication to senior managers, the SEC said in its order.

The Santa Monica, California-based company previously settled a U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission lawsuit alleging widespread sex discrimination.

The company fired a slew of people to address widespread allegations of sexual harassment and other misconduct. Its board has said it found no evidence to suggest senior executives intentionally ignored and sought to downplay the issues.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), which makes Xbox, had made a $69 billion bid to acquire Activision Blizzard, but the Federal Trade Commission asked a judge in December to block the transaction. EU authorities are also examining the deal.

Shares of Activision Blizzard were down 1.8% by 12:35 p.m. EST (1735 GMT) amid a broader sell-off on Wall Street.

666,511,Microsoft,2023-02-03,"TomTom sees further revenue growth in 2023, shares rally 8%","













Feb 3 (Reuters) - Dutch navigation and digital mapping company TomTom (TOM2.AS) said on Friday it expected revenue growth to continue in 2023, boosted by increased car production levels and new automotive contracts.

After being hit by a global chip shortage that disrupted the automotive and electronics industries, TomTom is now starting to benefit from a recovery in global car production.

""Pressures on supply chains are not gone away but they are reducing and there's better control"", Chief Executive Harold Goddijn told Reuters, pointing to positive effects from increasing car volumes and a ramp-up in market share gains.

At 1000 GMT, TomTom shares were up 8%.

Increased car production volumes and a further ramp up of some contracts led Automotive to generate revenues of 77 million euros in the quarter, an increase of 64% year-on-year, Chief Finance Officer Taco Titulaer said in a statement.

The group, whose customers include Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), expects revenue growth to continue over the current fiscal year, with a strong increase in automotive revenues offsetting declines in both its consumer and enterprise businesses.

""The electrification drive will also have a positive effect on take rates, as so far all electric cars that are being produced have maps and range calculations and those specific functions that are mandatory for a good EV experience"", Goddijn told Reuters.

The Amsterdam-based firm forecast revenue for 2023 in a range of 540 million euros to 580 million euros ($588.33 million-$631.91 million), with free cash flow of between 0% and +5% of the revenue, thanks to the positive impact of a change in revenue recognition timing for new map subscriptions contracts.

The group had previously guided for a revenue of 500-550 million euros and a free cash flow at breakeven.

""Due to a strong backlog and the upgrade to FCF (free cash flow) guidance, we would expect a positive reaction"", UBS said in a note, while ING pointed to better-than-expected automotive revenue.

The company posted revenue of 139 million euros for the quarter ended Dec. 31, beating a company-compiled analysts' average forecast of 120 million euros.

Feb 3 (Reuters) - Big Tech companies have a new obsession: artificial intelligence.

This week, chief executives across the sector packed earnings calls with mentions of the heavily hyped technology, which until recently existed more in the background than as a solid contributor to the bottom line.

In conference calls after financial results, tech execs uttered the phrases ""AI,"" ""generative AI,"" or ""machine learning"" from two to six times as often as they did in the previous quarter, according to a review of conference transcripts by Reuters.

Executives from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), behind the latest big rivalry in tech, took their battle to the conference-call front lines. On Thursday, Alphabet appeared to edge out the competition. The Google-owner's call referred to AI 45 times, up from 13 times at the end of the third quarter, outpacing Microsoft, whose call was peppered with 39 references, up from 15 in the previous quarter.

The release of software that can generate virtually text and images, exemplified by ChatGPT, a chatbot from the startup OpenAI, has set off a race to integrate AI into more products and for investors to bet on which company will emerge on top.

Microsoft's investment in OpenAI and aggressive efforts to make ChatGPT widely available to its cloud customers, among other plans, represent a new challenge to Alphabet. Industry observers have said embedding human-like, ChatGPT-style responses in Microsoft's Bing search engine could give it a leg up on Alphabet's Google, long the information search leader.

In a potential nod to the public's ChatGPT fixation, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said Google remained in the game.

""We'll pursue this work boldly, but with a deep sense of responsibility,"" he said.

AI software will be an important focus for Alphabet, which is planning to make its own LaMDA chatbot software publicly available in the coming weeks, he added.

David Heger, an analyst with Edward Jones, said Google was opening up more about its large AI investments after staying quiet.

""They were much more vocal about how that benefits pretty much all parts of their business and how they expect that to be further integrated into their business going forward,"" he said.

SHAPING SOCIAL MEDIA

Snap Inc (SNAP.N) CEO Evan Spiegel said on the social media company's fourth-quarter call that generative AI would be critical over the next five years to growing augmented reality (AR), which is important to its business.

That technology, which overlays computerized images onto the real world, is currently limited because artists must build 3D models, but generative AI can speed up the process, Spiegel said.

""Imagine playing around with your kids wearing AR glasses and saying, 'oh my gosh, there's a pirate ship and a big monster.' We can bring those to life using generative (AI) art, which I think is really exciting,"" he said.

Mark Zuckerberg likewise called generative AI ""an extremely exciting new area"" on Wednesday during a conference call that referenced the phrase 30 times, up from 22 times in the previous quarter. The Facebook founder and CEO of Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), whose shares rocketed 20% after reporting financial results, said users could expect the company to ""launch a number of different things this year"" in generative AI.

Meta plans to incorporate the new technology across almost all its products, such as generating images, videos, avatars and 3D assets, Zuckerberg said. The software will help content creators produce more across Meta's apps, he added. And marketers could use generative AI to help with written copy for their paid posts or create imagery and video, Nicola Mendelsohn, vice president of the global business group for Meta, said in an interview.

""One of my goals for Meta is to build on our research to become a leader in generative AI,"" said Zuckerberg.

Even at Apple Inc (AAPL.O), where hardware such as the iPhone has reigned supreme, AI is a big part of the future.

Asked by an analyst about Apple's AI strategy, Chief Executive Tim Cook said Thursday the company is using such tech to power features like car crash detection in its iPhone and Apple Watch, and that it will be applied throughout Apple's products and services.

""We see an enormous potential in this space to affect virtually everything we do,"" Cook said. ""It's obviously a horizontal technology, not a vertical. And so it will affect every product and every service that we have.""

REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes/File Photo















SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 3 (Reuters) - An Iranian government-backed hacking team allegedly stole and leaked private customer data belonging to French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, security researchers at Microsoft said on Friday.

The magazine was hacked in early January after it published a series of cartoons that negatively depicted Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. The caricatures were part of a media campaign that Charlie Hebdo said was intended to support anti-government protests in the Islamic nation.

Representatives for the Iranian and French governments did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A press officer for Charlie Hebdo said the magazine had no comment on the matter ""for the moment.""

Iran publicly vowed an ""effective response"" to the ""insulting"" cartoons, and summoned the French envoy in Tehran, while also ending activities of the French Institute of Research in Iran and saying it was re-evaluating France's cultural activities in the country.

The hack-and-leak targeting Charlie Hebdo was part of a wider digital influence operation with techniques matching previously identified activity linked to Iranian state-backed hacking teams, Microsoft researchers said in a report. The group responsible is the same one that U.S. Department of Justice officials earlier identified as having conducted a ""multi-faceted campaign"" to interfere in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Microsoft said. Iran denied the claims at the time.

Amid Iran's criticism of the Khamenei cartoons, a group of hackers calling itself ""Holy Souls"" posted on an online forum that they had access to the names and contact details of more than 200,000 Charlie Hebdo subscribers. In their post, they said they would sell the information for 20 bitcoins ($470,000).

A sample of the leaked data was later released and verified as authentic by the French newspaper Le Monde.

""This information, obtained by the Iranian actor, could put the magazine's subscribers at risk for online or physical targeting by extremist organizations,"" the Microsoft researchers said.

To amplify their operation, the Iranian hackers used Twitter accounts with fake or stolen identities to criticize the Khamenei cartoons. Two accounts impersonating a Charlie Hebdo editor and a technology executive also posted the leaked data before Twitter banned them, Microsoft said.

Twitter’s press team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

669,170,Microsoft,2023-02-03,Big Tech earnings face more heat as cloud cover fades,"













Feb 3 (Reuters) - Big Tech results reinforced concerns a boom in cloud services is easing, limiting a lucrative source of profit when a slowing economy has hit the companies' other businesses and prompting a bet on artificial intelligence as the next growth driver.

Earnings from Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) - which together dominate the cloud market - showed growth in the business was at its lowest since they started breaking out the metric in 2015 and was on track to slow further.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), which has the smallest cloud business among the three, said Google Cloud grew 32%, the slowest rise since the company began reporting the measure in 2019.

The poor results reflect a shift to post-pandemic frugality by corporate customers whose budgets have been squeezed in the past year by high inflation and rising interest rates.

""Once thought as the most defensive revenue stream in tech, we are seeing investors questioning the cyclicality for the (cloud) business,"" analysts at Bernstein said.

Cloud services had long been a reliable source of earnings for Microsoft and Amazon.

The Windows maker posted growth of around 50% in its Azure cloud-computing business for each quarter of calendar 2020, when the pandemic forced people to work and study at home. Meanwhile, market leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) reported sales jump of about 30% during the same period.

Times, though, have changed.

[1/3] The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics centre in Boves, France, August 8, 2018. REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol//File Photo 1 2 3

Growth at AWS slowed to a record low of 20% in the last three months of 2022 to $21.4 billion, slightly missing analysts' estimates of $22.03 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Microsoft's revenue in its so-called intelligent cloud business that includes Azure rose 18% to beat expectations for October to December. But its current-quarter forecast of $21.7 billion to $22 billion was below estimates of $22.14 billion.

""The deceleration in AWS was even worse than expected and means Amazon can't rely on that business units' operating profits as much in coming quarters,"" said Andrew Lipsman, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence.

Amazon finance chief Brian Olsavsky said on Thursday that the company expects slower cloud growth rates for the next few quarters. That echoed Microsoft, which said last week that growth in its Azure cloud-computing business would slow by 4-5 basis points in the March quarter.

""You've just come off two years of rapid movement of workloads to the cloud, there's probably a lot of inefficiency in cloud spending and now there is a shifting focus to greater efficiency,"" said James Cordwell, analyst at Atlantic Equities.

AI SILVER LINING

A potential boom in AI after the viral success of OpenAI's ChatGPT could boost demand for cloud services again though, analysts said. AI applications require massive computing power, a boon for companies whose services help run the technology.

As an investor and partner of OpenAI, Microsoft looks well poised, analysts said, but any gains may take time to translate into profits.

""Those (AI) advancements and demand for related cloud services will take time to materialize. They're not likely to offset current headwinds in the enterprise market over the next few quarters,"" Lipsman said.

670,207,Microsoft,2023-02-06,'Call of Duty' steers Activision sales in tough quarter for game makers,"













Feb 6 (Reuters) - Videogame publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) beat Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter adjusted sales on Monday, thanks to the success of the latest game in its ""Call of Duty"" franchise.

A string of launches in October and November, including

""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II"", ""Warzone 2.0"" and ""World of Warcraft: Dragonflight"" from the fantastical world of ""Azeroth"", helped the company hold the attention of the gaming community.

Activision's results are a bright spot as some of its industry peers including Electronics Arts (EA.O), Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO.O) and Xbox maker Microsoft (MSFT.O) have reported drab results.

The video-gaming industry is feeling the squeeze of inflation as American households tighten their budgets. However, Activision has managed to largely avoid the issues plaguing the wider industry and keep the buzz around its news launches through its focus on building strong gaming franchises.

""Modern Warfare II"" delivered the highest opening-quarter sell-through in the franchise's history and crossed the $1 billion mark within 10 days of its late-October launch, the company said.

""Our specialists have highlighted a flight to quality by gamers and that is what Activision Blizzard is experiencing,"" said Nicholas Cauley, an analyst at global research firm Third Bridge.

Activision expects its full-year adjusted sales to grow at least in high-single digits, bolstered by the launch of games including ""Diablo IV.""

Adjusted sales in the quarter ended Dec. 31 came in at $3.57 billion, compared with analysts' estimate of $3.16 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Activision's $69-billion takeover by Microsoft is being challenged by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and being investigated by EU authorities. Activision said the companies are continuing to engage with regulators reviewing the transaction.

Fourth quarter net income fell to $403 million, or 51 cents per share, from $564 million, or 72 cents per share, a year earlier.

Feb 6 (Reuters) - Google owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) on Monday said it will launch a chatbot service and more artificial intelligence for its search engine as well as developers, an answer to Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) in their rivalry to lead a new wave of computing.

Microsoft, meanwhile, said it planned its own AI reveal for Tuesday.

The cascade of news reflects how Silicon Valley is anticipating massive change from so-called generative AI, technology that can create prose or other content on command and free up white-collar workers' time.

The ascent of ChatGPT, a chatbot from Microsoft-backed OpenAI that could disrupt how consumers search for information, has been one of the biggest challenges to Google in recent memory.

In a blog post, Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said his company is opening a conversational AI service called Bard to test users for feedback, followed by a public release in the coming weeks.

He also said Google plans to add AI features to its search engine that synthesize material for complex queries, like whether learning guitar or piano is easier. Currently, Google presents text that exists elsewhere on the Web for questions where the answer is clear.

Google's update for search, the timing of which it did not disclose, reflects how the company is bolstering its service while Microsoft is doing the same for Bing, embedding OpenAI's capabilities in it.

Microsoft has said it plans to imbue AI into its all its products and on Tuesday plans to brief news outlets on developments it did not specify, with its CEO Satya Nadella, according to an invitation seen by Reuters. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, tweeted that he would also attend the event.

How Google aims to differentiate Bard from OpenAI's ChatGPT was unclear. Pichai said the new service draws on information from the internet; ChatGPT's knowledge is up to date as of 2021.

""Bard seeks to combine the breadth of the world's knowledge with the power, intelligence and creativity of our"" AI, Pichai said.

Behind the new chatbot is LaMDA, Google's AI that generated text with such skill that a company engineer last year called it sentient, a claim the technology giant and scientists widely dismissed.

In a demo of the service, Bard like its rival chatbot invites users to give it a prompt while warning its response may be inappropriate or inaccurate. It then bulleted three answers to a query about a space telescope's discoveries, the demo showed.

Google is relying on a version of LaMDA that requires less computing power so it can serve more users and improve with their feedback, Pichai said.

ChatGPT at times has turned away users because of explosive growth, with UBS analysts reporting it had 57 million unique visitors in December outpacing potentially TikTok in adoption.

Google also plans to give technology tools, first powered by LaMDA and later by other AI, to creators and enterprises starting next month, Pichai said.

672,174,Microsoft,2023-02-06,Saudi Arabia says tech giants to invest more than $9 billion in kingdom,"













RIYADH, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has attracted more than $9 billion in investments in future technologies, including by U.S. giants Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Oracle Corp (ORCL.N), which are building cloud regions in the kingdom, a government minister said on Monday.

Saudi Minister of Communication and Information Technology Abdullah Alswaha said Microsoft will invest $2.1 billion in a global super-scaler cloud, while Oracle has committed $1.5 billion to build a new cloud region in Riyadh.

""The investments... will enhance the kingdom of Saudi Arabia's position as the largest digital market in the Middle East and North Africa,"" Alswaha said at LEAP, an international technology forum taking place in Riyadh.

Alswaha did not give details on the timeframe. Oracle told Reuters the investment will be made over several years.

Saudi officials have pressed international companies to invest in the kingdom and move their regional headquarters to Riyadh in order to benefit from government contracts.

The kingdom has been pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into an economic plan, known as Vision 2030, led by its de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

But it has struggled to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), one of the pillars of Vision 2030, which aims to diversify the economy away from oil.

The minister said China's Huawei (HWT.UL) will also invest $400 million in cloud infrastructure for its services in Saudi Arabia and another cloud region in partnership with oil giant Aramco (2222.SE).

An additional $4.5 billion was invested in global and local assets across multiple sectors at the forum, Alswaha added.

Tonomus, a subsidiary of the $500 billion signature NEOM project of the crown prince, said last year it invested $1 billion in 2022 in AI, including a metaverse platform.

Increased demand for cloud computing has pushed technology companies such as Oracle, Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN.O) and Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O) to set up data centres across the world to speed up data transfer.

673,184,Microsoft,2023-02-06,Orrick antitrust practice head jumps to Dechert,"Summary

Summary Companies

Companies Law firms John Jurata led Orrick's antitrust practice before moving to Dechert

Jurata, Cohen and Lahnborg advise top tech companies including Microsoft, Sonos, Netflix, LG and Zillow.















(Reuters) - U.S. law firm Dechert said Monday it has hired three tech-focused antitrust partners in Washington, D.C., San Francisco and London from rival firm Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, including global practice head John 'Jay' Jurata, Jr.

Washington-based Jurata, a former U.S. Navy officer, led Orrick’s antitrust practice, Dechert said. Russel Cohen and Douglas Lahnborg are also joining the Philadelphia-founded firm as partners.

Jurata's clients have included Microsoft Corp., Sonos Inc, Sharp Corporation, LG Corp. and Panasonic, according to his archived bio on Orrick’s website. He most recently represented Microsoft and Sonos in their role as interested parties in the U.S. Department of Justice’s antitrust lawsuit against Google.

He said in an email that his clients have ""responded positively"" to the move.

Cohen joins Dechert in San Francisco. His clients have included LinkedIn, Netflix and Zillow, according to an archived bio on Orrick’s website.

Lahnborg is joining Dechert's London office, having most recently headed Orrick's outpost in the city. Lahnborg represents clients before antitrust regulators in the EU and the UK, Dechert said.

Lahnborg also helped launch Orrick’s office in Brussels, the EU’s antitrust capital, according to his archived bio on Orrick’s website. He will focus on expanding Dechert’s antitrust capabilities on the ground in the UK and Brussels, Lahnborg said in a statement.

“We are extremely pleased to welcome Jay, Russ and Douglas, particularly at a time when antitrust activity in the high-tech industry continues to increase globally,” co-chair of Dechert’s antitrust practice Mike Cowie said in a statement.

An Orrick spokesperson wished Jurata, Cohen and Lahnborg well. Orrick's antitrust practice will now be led by competition attorney Amy Ray in Washington, the spokesperson said.

San Francisco-founded Orrick in November added Anna Aryankalayil, who served as attorney adviser to former commission of the Federal Trade Commission, Noah Phillips, to its antitrust practice. The firm also added antitrust partners Eileen Cole from White & Case and Craig Falls from Dechert last year.

Orrick last week completed a combination with Washington-founded law firm Buckley.

674,482,Microsoft,2023-02-06,EU's Breton urges rethink on cross-border telecoms mergers,"













BRUSSELS, Feb 6 (Reuters) - EU industry chief Thierry Breton urged antitrust regulators on Monday to consider allowing more cross-border mergers in the European telecoms industry, backing calls by Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), Orange (ORAN.PA), Telefonica (TEF.MC) and Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI).

EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager has been reluctant to allow telecoms providers acquire EU peers without hefty remedies, especially when deals reduce the number of players from four to three, underlining concerns about the market power of fewer but larger telecoms operators.

The telecoms industry however said consolidation is required to pool resources to roll out costly fast-speed broadband and 5G.

""I believe that creating a true single market for telecommunications services also requires a reflection on encouraging cross-border consolidation, all while preserving fair and necessary competition for the benefit of our consumers,"" Breton said in a speech to be delivered at an event in Helsinki.

On the issue of whether Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O), Meta (META.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) should bear some network costs, Breton said the European Commission will launch a consultation this month on the topic.

""The investments which will be required to achieve our ambitions will be enormous and we need to ensure that they are matched by the availability of sufficient funding. The burden of this financing should not be only on the shoulders of the member states or the EU budget,"" he said.

""At a time when technology companies are using most bandwidth and telco operators are seeing their return on investment drop, this also raises the question of who pays for the next generation of connectivity infrastructure,"" Breton said.

675,308,Microsoft,2023-02-06,AI stocks rally in latest Wall Street craze sparked by ChatGPT,"













Feb 6 (Reuters) - Shares of C3.ai Inc, BigBear.ai and SoundHound AI extended a rally on Monday as artificial intelligence becomes a new buzzword on Wall Street with the viral success of ChatGPT chatbot, attracting interest from retail punters.

Software firm C3.ai (AI.N) rose 11%, analytics firm BigBear.ai (BBAI.N) jumped nearly 21% and conversation artificial intelligence company SoundHound (SOUN.O) surged 40%.

Tickers for the three small-cap companies were among those that were being bandied about on the investor-focused social media platform, stocktwits.com.

""Any company that mentions ChatGPT or something about AI, sees this rally ... it's just the hot buzzword of the month,"" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Triple D Trading.

The success of OpenAI's ChatGPT, which drew multi-billion dollar investment from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), has left investors scouring for companies that develop AI-related technologies.

ChatGPT is estimated to have reached 100 million monthly active users in January, just two months after launch, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history, according to a UBS study last week.

C3.ai and SoundHound have more than doubled in value this year while BigBear.ai has surged more than 700%.

The surge in prices was due to long buying as investors moved into AI stocks as opposed to any significant short covering, said Matthew Unterman, director at analytics platform S3 Partners in New York.

676,493,Microsoft,2023-02-06,Take-Two's dour forecast deepens concern in videogame industry,"













Feb 6 (Reuters) - Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO.O) lowered its annual bookings forecast on Monday, signaling a deeper struggle faced by videogame publishers to keep gamers glued amid a weakening economy and broader slump in the gaming market.

The dour forecast follows the disappointing show from rival Electronic Arts (EA.O) and Xbox maker Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), increasing fears that the slump in gaming market might sustain this year.

""The repeated misses by major publishers evidences the softer market for video games after a strong period during the last few years and tests their ability to navigate the coming quarters as they compete for consumer attention and spending,"" said Joost Van Dreunen, a lecturer at New York University Stern School of Business.

Shares of New York-based Take-Two fell 1% in extended trading.

Take-Two Chief Executive Strauss Zelnick said net bookings took a hit as ""consumers shifted their holiday spending toward established blockbuster franchises and titles that were offered with pricing promotions in light of macroeconomic conditions.""

He added that the trend affected performance of some new releases.

Despite releasing to good reviews on Dec. 2, Take-Two's role-playing game ""Marvel's Midnight Suns"" was the 14th most downloaded title on Sony's PlayStation 5 in December, trailing even the two-year-old title ""Spider-Man: Miles Morales.""

As inflation squeezes budgets, more gamers are expected to stick to their favorite gaming franchises, instead of experimenting with newer titles from other studios, analysts have said.

Activision's latest title in this popular franchise ""Call of Duty"" helped it to beat Street estimates for fourth-quarter adjusted sales on Monday.

Take-Two posted third quarter adjusted sales of $1.38 billion, compared to analysts' estimate of $1.46 billion. Excluding items, it earned 86 cents per share during the quarter.

The company now expects full-year adjusted sales between $5.2 billion and $5.25 billion, compared with $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion forecast previously.

677,552,Microsoft,2023-02-06,EU lawmakers aim for common position on draft AI rules by early March,"













STOCKHOLM/BRUSSELS, Feb 6 (Reuters) - EU lawmakers hope to agree on draft artificial intelligence rules next month, with the aim of clinching a deal with EU countries by the end of the year, one of the legislators steering the AI Act said.

The European Commission proposed the AI rules in 2021 in an attempt to foster innovation and set a global standard for a technology, used in everything from self-driving cars and chatbots to automated factories, currently led by China and the United States.

""We are still in good time to fulfil the overall target and calendar that we assumed in the very beginning, which is to wrap it up during this mandate,"" Dragos Tudorache, member of the European Parliament and co-rapporteur of the EU AI Act, told Reuters.

""It took slightly longer than I initially thought,"" he said. ""This text has seen a level of complexity that is even higher than the typical Brussels complex machinery.""

The proposed legislation has drawn criticism from lawmakers and consumer groups for not fully addressing risks from AI systems, but the companies involved have warned that stricter rules could stifle innovation.

Intense debate over how AI should be governed led several experts to predict that the draft legislation might hit a bottleneck and get delayed.

""There are a few loose ends for all the political families. I told them in the last meeting that you know you have success in a compromise when everyone is equally unhappy,"" he said. ""Some people will say this is optimistic... I am hoping it will happen.""

One of the areas of contention is the definition of ""General Purpose AI"", which some believe should be considered as high risk while others point to the risks posed by popular chatbot ChatGPT as an area that needs more regulatory scrutiny.

""During this year alone, we are going to see some exponential leaps forward not only for ChatGPT but for a lot of other general purpose machines,"" he said, adding that the lawmakers were trying to write some basic principles on what makes general purpose such a distinct type of AI.

ChatGPT can generate articles, essays, jokes and even poetry in response to prompts. OpenAI, a private company backed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), made it available to the public for free in November.

EU industry chief Thierry Breton has said new proposed artificial intelligence rules will aim to tackle concerns about the risks around ChatGPT.

Critics of regulatory over-reach however said such a move could lead to increased costs and more compliance pressure for companies, throttling innovation.

""I think if that will be the effect of this Act, then we will be severely missing our objective. And we haven't done our jobs if that's what's going to happen,"" Tudorache said.

678,572,Microsoft,2023-02-06,"Oracle to invest $1.5 billion in Saudi Arabia, open data centre in Riyadh","













Feb 6 (Reuters) - Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) plans to invest $1.5 billion in Saudi Arabia in the coming years as it builds up its cloud footprint in the kingdom and opens its third public cloud region in Riyadh, a company official said.

Increased demand for cloud computing has pushed technology companies such as Oracle, Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O) to set up data centres across the world to speed up data transfer.

Saudi officials have pressed international companies to invest in the kingdom and move their regional headquarters to Riyadh in order to benefit from government contracts.

""We are finalising the plans for opening the Riyadh region. We are still working with our suppliers before we can announce the actual date,"" Nick Redshaw, a senior vice president at Oracle, said in an interview from Dubai.

Redshaw said the investment will be made over several years without providing detail. He added that Oracle would also expand the capacity of its cloud region in Jeddah, which the company first opened in 2020.

The company made the announcement as global tech companies gathered for a major tech conference in the Saudi capital.

Though Oracle lags its bigger rivals in the race to corner the cloud computing market, it was among the first large tech companies to open a data centre in Saudi Arabia.

The kingdom has been devoted hundreds of billions of dollars to an economic transformation, known as Vision 2030, led by its de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

But it has struggled to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), one of the pillars of Vision 2030, which aims at diversifying the economy away from oil.

FDI reached just under $4.1 billion in the first half of 2022, a fraction of the ambitious $100 billion target set for the end of this decade.

While Oracle has been working with the government, Saudi Arabia has been trying to encourage foreign firms to set up headquarters in the country or risk losing out on government contracts and has given them until the end of 2023 to comply.

""We are working closely with the Saudi government to finalise plans for that regional headquarter requirement and we will announce them as we finalise that with them,"" Redshaw said.

Oracle has also won contracts from the crown prince's $500 billion flagship NEOM project, a futuristic mega city and economic zone which the crown prince is building on the Red Sea coast.

NEOM is one of our largest consumers of cloud capability in Saudi Arabia, Redshaw said.

Summary Companies Cohere plans to introduce new dialogue model next -CEO

Talking to marketing, consulting, tech firms on generative AI















Feb 6 (Reuters) - Cohere, an AI foundation model company that competes with Microsoft-backed OpenAI, is in talks to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in a funding round that could value the startup at more than $6 billion, sources told Reuters, in the latest sign of the investment frenzy around generative AI.

Toronto-based Cohere, established by former researchers at Alphabet (GOOGL.O) in 2019, has quickly risen through the AI startup ranks given their intensive research background and close ties to Google, investors said.

Foundation models are AI systems that are trained on large sets of data, with the ability to learn from new data to perform a variety of tasks. Generative AI aims to make human-like creations through computer code that has processed vast amounts of data.

Cohere is planning on introducing a new dialogue model that would resemble ChatGPT to let enterprise users generate text and engage with the model to refine the output. Unlike ChatGPT, Cohere's technology will mainly be accessible to developers and businesses, CEO Aidan Gomez told Reuters in an interview.

""Our chat models are focused more on business applicable tasks like answering questions than writing poems. We don’t plan to hand them over to everyone to use for free without limit,"" said Gomez. ""We want to build a healthy and sustainable business.""

Gomez declined to comment on the funding status of the company.

It was not immediately clear how much Cohere was seeking to raise in the current round. Sources requested anonymity for discussing private funding matters.

Cohere has raised $170 million to date from funds including Index Ventures, Tiger Global and AI luminaries Geoffrey Hinton, Fei-Fei Li and Pieter Abbeel.

FOCUS ON NLP

Focusing on training natural language processing (NLP) models, Cohere competes with a group of foundation model providers such as OpenAI and Anthropic.

Gomez said the company differentiates itself by focusing on serving enterprise users, and Cohere has been talking to companies from marketing, consulting and tech to help them incorporate generative AI.

Cohere announced a cloud partnership with Alphabet to access its TPU computing power last year. Its language AI also becomes available on Amazon’s (AMZN.O) fully managed machine learning service SageMaker in January.

Last month, Cohere hired Martin Kon, the former chief finance executive at YouTube, to lead its product and market strategy. Cohere is powering some consumer applications including Hyperwrite, which helps people write faster and generate articles using AI.

""We expect this year to be a breakout year for us to bring in enterprise customers,"" said Gomez.

Gomez said Cohere will focus on text generation models, unlike its peer OpenAI which has released GPT-3 model for text as well as DALL-E for image generation.

Since the launch of ChatGPT in November, the technology that can generate prose, imagery or computer code on command has attracted investors' attention. Other foundation model providers such as Anthropic is also in talks to raise funding at multi-billion valuations, investor sources said.

With Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) $10 billion investment in OpenAI, other big tech companies, including Alphabet and Oracle (ORCL.N), are also looking at investing in AI startups, sources said.

Gomez said Cohere will not take strategic investments that require exclusive rights.

""It's important for us to stay independent and work with different cloud providers,"" said Gomez.

680,300,Microsoft,2023-02-06,Indian Oil to partner with LanzaJet to produce cleaner aviation fuel,"













BENGALURU, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Indian Oil Corp (IOC.NS) will sign an agreement with LanzaJet to produce cleaner aviation fuel at its Panipat refinery in northern India, the state-run refiner's Chairman S. M. Vaidya told Reuters on Monday.

Chicago, U.S.-based LanzaJet helps companies produce aviation fuel from ethanol manufactured from agricultural or industrial waste, counting Microsoft, the United States Department of Energy, Japan's Mitsui & Co (8031.T) and Canada's Suncor Energy (SU.TO) as its investors.

By 2030, 2% of aviation fuel produced by Indian Oil will be sustainable aviation fuel, Vaidya told Reuters on the sidelines of the India Energy Week in Bengaluru. The state-run refiner currently does not produce any aviation fuel from ethanol.

Indian Oil already has a tie up with LanzaTech, LanzaJet's parent company, to convert waste to ethanol, and the LanzaJet deal will help upgrade the ethanol to cleaner jet fuel.

The oil refiner is also in talks with Italy's Snamprogetti SpA for the conversion of gas pipelines into hydrogen pipelines, Vaidya added.

Unlike the United States and the European Union, India does not have policies governing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) yet. The European Commission SAF mandate is expected to start in 2025 with a minimum volume of SAF at 2%.

LanzaTech would aim to start producing ethanol-based aviation fuel at the Panipat refinery in 2-3 years, Chief Executive Officer Jennifer Holmgren said.

""We can blend up to 50% (SAF with aviation fuel),"" she told Reuters on the sidelines of the energy conference.

The company said it had identified a recent change that might have caused issues within Outlook.com, without giving further details.

The outage comes shortly after Microsoft's cloud platform, Azure, faced disruptions, taking down services such as Teams and Microsoft 365 used by millions around the globe.

Many users took to Twitter to share updates and memes about the service disruption, with #Microsoft365 trending as a hashtag on the social media site.

682,792,Microsoft,2023-02-07,Wall Street rallies but trade choppy as investors digest Powell comments,"Summary

Summary Companies Dow up 0.78%, S&P 500 up 1.29%, Nasdaq up 1.90%

Microsoft up on investment in AI

DuPont climbs on strong Q4 profit

Boeing up on announcement of layoffs















Feb 7 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied to a convincingly higher close on Tuesday, but trade was choppy as investors digested comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell about how long the central bank may need to tame inflation.

Powell said 2023 should be a year of ""significant declines in inflation.""

His comments renewed investor hopes for less aggressive monetary policy that wavered after a strong U.S. jobs report last Friday. ""We didn't expect it to be this strong,"" Powell said at the Economic Club of Washington, referring to the nonfarm payrolls report for January, but it ""shows why we think this will be a process that takes quite a bit of time.""

""Powell expects they're not going to be cutting rates anytime soon, but that there is a good path, that they’re accomplishing what they need to accomplish,” said Shawn Cruz, head trading strategist at TD Ameritrade.

Wall Street's main indexes fluctuated wildly during and after Powell's remarks, and analysts said volatility is unlikely to dissipate soon.

""Until we see softening and inflation throughout the economy and throughout the globe, it's going to be hard to push the markets up in a decisive fashion,"" said Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq (.IXIC) rallied on news form Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), and the S&P 500 (.SPX) also got a boost. The company's shares rose 1.29% as it unveiled an integration of ChatGPT, a chatbot from OpenAI, into its products.

Following Powell's comments, Morgan Stanley said it added 25 basis point to its forecast for the May policy meeting, but continued to expect the first 25 basis point rate cut for December, 2023.

Last week, the Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points, with markets now pricing in a peak rate above 5% after Friday's strong jobs data.

U.S.-listed shares of Baidu Inc soared 12.18% as the Chinese search engine said it would conclude testing of its ChatGPT-style project ""Ernie Bot"" in March.

Most sectors on the S&P 500 ended higher. The energy sector (.SPNY) the top gainer as crude prices surged more than 3% on Powell's remarks. The technology (.SPLRCL) and communication services (.SPLRCT) sectors were also among top gainers.

Among top gainers on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI), Boeing Inc (BA.N) went up 3.84% after the U.S. planemaker confirmed it expects to cut about 2,000 white-collar jobs.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 265.67 points, or 0.78%, to 34,156.69, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 52.92 points, or 1.29%, to 4,164 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 226.34 points, or 1.9%, to 12,113.79.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.98 billion shares, in line with the full session over the last 20 trading days.

On Monday, U.S. stock indexes were dragged by views that rates would stay higher for longer. Still, all three major averages are in the black for 2023, with the Nasdaq adding over 15%, led by a revival in battered mega-cap growth stocks.

So far, more than half of the companies on the S&P 500 have reported quarterly earnings, with 69.1% of them beating expectations, according to Refinitiv. Still, analysts expect fourth-quarter earnings to decline 3.1%.

DuPont De Nemours Inc (DD.N) jumped 7.50% on a higher-than-expected quarterly profit supported by higher pricing for its products.

Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY.O) plunged almost 50% as the home-goods retailer sought to raise $1 billion in a last-ditch effort to avoid bankruptcy. The company completed the equity offering after the close of trading.

Later on Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden will deliver the annual State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.68-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.42-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 5 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 90 new highs and 31 new lows.

683,641,Microsoft,2023-02-07,ChatGPT mania pumps up Chinese AI technology stocks,"













SHANGHAI, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Chinese artificial intelligence stocks are the latest rage in mainland markets as the global frenzy around the Microsoft-backed ChatGPT chatbot spurs speculative bets on the revolutionary computing technology.

Just two months after its launch, ChatGPT - which can generate articles, essays, jokes and even poetry in response to prompts - has been rated the fastest-growing consumer app in history. That has pushed Google owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) to plan its own chatbot service and using more artificial intelligence for its search engine.

While ChatGPT is not accessible in China, mainland investors are still pumping up the shares of AI technology companies such as Hanwang Technology Co (002362.SZ), TRS Information Technology Co (300229.SZ) and Cloudwalk Technology Co (688327.SS).

The CSI AI Industry Index (.CSI931071), which includes larger capitalized companies such as iFlytek Co (002230.SZ), is up about 17% this year, outperforming the benchmark CSI300 Index's (.CSI300) 6% rise.

To be sure, there is no indication that these AI companies are close to pushing out a ChatGPT-like product. The closest seems to be search engine giant Baidu Inc (9888.HK) with plans to complete testing of its ""Ernie bot"" in March. Its shares surged more than 15% on Tuesday after making the announcement.

""The industry as a whole tends to first speculate on expectations before only later trading on actual results,"" said Zhang Kexing, general manager of Beijing Gelei Asset Management.

Shares of Hanwang Technology, which makes products that enable intelligent interactions, jumped by their daily limit of 10% on Tuesday, the seventh consecutive session it has reached that limit since markets reopened from the Lunar New Year holiday, boosting prices by more than 60% so far in February.

The company expects to report an annual loss for 2022 but believes it has an edge over an interface like ChatGPT because its model can produce more precise results for clients.

Cloudwalk shares retreated 5.5% on Tuesday, but have nearly doubled in the seven trading days since the Lunar New Year holidays. On Tuesday, the company cautioned investors, saying its losses deepened in 2022, it has not cooperated with OpenAI, and has generated no revenues from ChatGPT-related services and products.

Other companies that have disclosed their progress in AI technology include TRS Information Technology, and Beijing Haitian Ruisheng Science Technology Ltd (688787.SS). Their share prices have soared too.

The price surge has stretched valuations. TRS for example, trades at nearly 60 times earnings, while Haitian Ruisheng's price-to-earnings ratio is more than 240.

Retail investor Lu Deyong has purchased shares in TRS and iFlytek and is seeking to profit from the ChatGPT hype.

""ChatGPT is just a hot idea,"" he said. However, he doesn't think ""China can realize such a technology in the short term.""

""For us retail investors, we prefer smaller stocks with this concept to make some quick money,"" Lu said.

684,491,Microsoft,2023-02-07,Nintendo promises 10% pay hike even as it trims profit outlook,"













TOKYO, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Japanese video game maker Nintendo Co Ltd (7974.T) said on Tuesday it plans to lift workers' base pay by 10% even though a firmer yen forced it to trim its full-year profit forecast.

The hefty pay hike comes amid calls by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for Japanese companies to pay workers more as inflation takes hold in an economy used to years of deflation and stagnant wages, and as Japan prepares for its annual spring round of labour negotiations.

Fast Retailing Co Ltd (9983.T), the parent of the Uniqlo clothing chain, was one of the first companies off the blocks, jolting Japan Inc when it said last month it would hike wages by as much as 40%.

""It's important for our long-term growth to secure our workforce,"" Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa told an earnings briefing.

For companies that can afford to do so, higher salaries may also help them attract talent as a falling birth rate and low immigration leave Japan with serious labour shortages.

The creator of ""Super Mario Bros"" and ""Legend of Zelda"" cut its operating profit 4% to 480 billion yen ($3.6 billion) for the year to March 31, much lower than a Refinitiv consensus forecast for a profit of 582 billion yen.

Nintendo also revised its annual software sales forecast down to 205 million units from 210 million, and cut its Switch console sales target to 18 million units from 19 million.

The Kyoto-based company does not plan to raise software or game console prices, but would consider doing so if circumstances demanded it, Furukawa said. He declined to comment when asked whether the company was considering a successor to the six-year old Switch.

Nintendo, which competes with PlayStation creator Sony Group Corp (6758.T) and Xbox maker Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), sold 8.2 million Switch units in the latest quarter, a 23% slide from the same period a year earlier.

685,327,Microsoft,2023-02-07,"Big Tech not doing enough to remove fake news, activist NGO Avaaz says","













BRUSSELS, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Twitter, Google's (GOOGL.O) YouTube, Meta Platform's (META.O) Facebook, Microsoft's (MSFT.O) LinkedIn and TikTok are not doing enough to remove fake news from their platforms, raising doubts about their ability to comply with new EU online content rules, activist NGO Avaaz said on Tuesday.

The companies are due to present reports this week on the measures they have taken to comply with the updated EU code of practice on disinformation which is linked to the online content rules known as the Digital Services Act (DSA) that came into force last November.

Avaaz said it analysed a sample pool of 108 fact-checked pieces of content related to a 2022 American anti-vaccine film and found efforts by the social media platforms including Meta's Instagram to remove disinformation fell short.

""Overall, just 22% of disinformation content we analysed was either labelled or removed by the six major platforms,"" Avaaz said.

It said the companies did not do enough to tackle disinformation in languages other than English.

""Despite explicit platform commitments in the code to improve their services in all EU languages, our research found that in certain EU languages - Italian, German, Hungarian, Danish, Spanish and Estonian - no platform took any action against violating posts,"" Avaaz said.

""This study suggests that most of the major platforms are failing to comply with their Code of Practice commitments and might infringe upcoming DSA obligations,"" the group said.

Meta, Alphabet, Twitter and Microsoft last year vowed to take a tougher line against disinformation after committing to the updated EU code.

Companies face fines up to 6% of their global turnover for DSA violations.

686,235,Microsoft,2023-02-07,"STMicro leans on AI, cloud as chip designs become more complex","













Feb 7 (Reuters) - European chipmaker STMicroelectronics (STM.BN) and chip design software maker Synopsys (SNPS.O) on Tuesday said STMicro had for the first time used artificial intelligence software running on Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) cloud to design a working chip.

The achievement would help solve the growing problem of getting increasingly complex designs ready for customers in an acceptable time, STMicro said.

The company is one of a several that are using AI to help design chips, which involves translating a complicated circuit architecture into a blueprint for fabricating billions of transistors on a small piece of silicon.

Synopsys, the maker of the AI software used by STMicro, said on Tuesday it had now been used to aide in designing 100 different chips from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS), SK Hynix (000660.KS) and others since it was first released in 2020.

The exact placement of the billions of transistors on a chip makes a big difference in its eventual performance. Engineers use software such as Synopsys's to figure out where to put them, running several rounds of experiments with several possible designs to find the best one.

The problem in recent years is that chips have become far, far more complex, which means that finding the right design takes more and more experiments. But business deadlines have not gotten any longer: customers still want a steady drumbeat of new chips year after year.

To meet those deadlines, the AI system's job is to help engineers weed out all the design experiments that will not lead to success and point to those that will.

""We have a limited amount of time,"" said Indavong Vongsavady, who oversees design tools for one of STMicro's groups. ""Limiting to a practical number the size of experiments that we run - that's the real point.""

Cloud computing also helps ease the time crunch. Shankar Krishnamoorthy, general manager of the design automation group at Synopsys, said that company's AI engine got better results faster when it had more computing power behind it. Cloud providers like Microsoft offer the option to rent a huge burst of computing power in a short time.

""In most engineering environments, people say, 'This is how much compute (power) I have. This is the time in which I need the results. Give me the best result,'"" Krishnamoorthy said.

687,208,Microsoft,2023-02-07,Baidu to finish testing ChatGPT-style project 'Ernie Bot' in March; shares rally,"













BEIJING, Feb 7 (Reuters) - China's Baidu Inc (9888.HK) said on Tuesday it would complete internal testing of a ChatGPT-style project called ""Ernie Bot"" in March, as interest in generative artificial intelligence (AI) gathers steam.

The search engine giant's Hong Kong-listed shares closed up 15.3% on Tuesday, while its U.S shares climbed 11.2% in morning trade.

A flurry of Chinese AI stocks also rallied, as the global frenzy around the Microsoft-backed (MSFT.O) chatbot sensation ChatGPT spurred speculative bets on the new technology.

Just two months after its launch, ChatGPT - which can generate articles, essays, jokes and even poetry in response to prompts - has been rated the fastest-growing consumer app in history.

It has prompted many tech firms to double down on the heavily hyped generative AI technology, which until recently existed more in the background than as a solid contributor to the bottom line.

Google owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) said on Monday it would launch a chatbot service and more AI for its search engine, while Microsoft plans its own AI reveal on Tuesday, underscoring growing rivalry to lead a new wave of computing.

Baidu, China's answer to Google, joined the frenzy on Tuesday.

It said Ernie，or ""Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration,"" is a large AI-powered language model introduced in 2019, and has gradually grown to be able to perform tasks including language understanding, language generation, and text-to-image generation.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters last week that Baidu was planning to launch such a service in March.

The person said Baidu aims to make the service available as a standalone application and gradually merge it into its search engine by incorporating chatbot-generated results when users make search requests.

ChatGPT and key Google services are not available in China, although some users have found workarounds to access such tools.

Beijing-based Baidu has been a first mover in China on other tech trends.

In late 2021, when the metaverse became a new buzzword, the company launched ""XiRang"" which it described as China's first metaverse platform.

The platform however was widely panned for not offering a high-level, immersive experience and Baidu said it was a work in progress.

The company has been investing heavily in AI technology, including in cloud services, chips and autonomous driving, as it looks to diversify its revenue sources.

688,204,Microsoft,2023-02-07,Retail investors flock to small-cap AI firms as Big Tech battles for share,"













Feb 7 (Reuters) - Retail investors are piling into small-cap firms that are into building artificial intelligence tools as companies including Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft jostle to pull ahead in the race for the next big growth driver.

The viral success of ChatGPT has turned the spotlight on AI on Wall Street, reminiscent of the blockchain hype from a few years ago when shares of companies remotely associated with the technology surged.

The $3 billion AI software firm C3.ai (AI.N) was the fifth most actively traded on Fidelity's platform for small investors on Monday, while drawing record daily retail inflows worth $31.4 million, as per Vanda Research. The stock fell 14.7% on Tuesday, although it is up about 140% so far this year.

""Small-cap firms have AI as a much larger part of their business than the larger ones,"" said Matthew Tuttle, chief executive officer of Tuttle Capital Management on the reason behind retail investors' focus on the smaller firms.

Tuttle said he had shorted C3.ai shares about a week ago, but was looking to switch to the long side because ""that's where the action is.""

Shares of SoundHound AI (SOUN.O), which offers voice AI platform services, and Thailand's security firm Guardforce AI (GFAI.O) have more than doubled in value so far this year, while those of analytics firm BigBear.ai have seen a nine-fold rise.

SoundHound AI was last down about 14.9% and BigBear.ai fell 18%, while Guardforce AI (GFAI.O) slipped 3%.

Shares of Microsoft (MSFT.O), which backs ChatGPT parent OpenAI, gained about 2.4% after the tech giant said it was revamping its Bing search engine with AI such that users will be able to chat with the search engine naturally.

The new Bing chatbot will help users refine queries and even draft and translate emails, with the company calling Bing the ""AI-powered robot for the web.""

Retail investors show greater interest in AI stocks as companies unveil chatbots

Alphabet (GOOGL.O) said on Monday it would launch a chatbot service called Bard, along with more AI tools to power its search engine.

Microsoft is in a strong position in the AI race due to the combination of its close partnership with OpenAI and its Azure capabilities around compute and data, Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow said.

""If you're investing in AI, you should consider the fact that these smaller companies are competing against Goliath, and Goliath has the scale, efficiency and capital to own the space,"" eToro analyst Callie Cox said, adding there has been a lot of interest around AI lately.

U.S.-listed shares of Baidu Inc climbed 9.9% on Tuesday after the Chinese search engine said it would complete internal testing of a ChatGPT-style project called ""Ernie Bot"" in March. Earlier in the day, a clutch of Chinese AI stocks had also rallied.

""The market is right now trying to search for what would the next big thing that's going to lead markets over the next 10 years and AI is that,"" said Chen Zhao, chief global strategist at Alpine Macro.

""It could be speculative in nature, but everybody thinks that it's going to be a big deal going forward.""

A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Ankur Banerjee

Investors are just about coming to terms with the eye-popping payrolls number from Friday, but with Fed Chair Jerome Powell due to speak later in the day, the market will ponder which Powell will turn up (the hawk or the dove). Perhaps ChatGPT has the answer.

Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unveiled a rival to super popular ChatGPT, saying it will launch a chatbot service named 'Bard'. And so the battle for generative AI, technology that can create prose or other content on command and free up white-collar workers' time, heats up, with Microsoft (MSFT.O) planning its own AI reveal for Tuesday.

The meteoric rise of ChatGPT, a chatbot from Microsoft-backed OpenAI, has also helped attract retail investors in other smaller firms as artificial intelligence becomes the latest buzzword on Wall Street. (More than 20 years after AI the movie was released)

The main event in Asia was Australia's central bank raising its cash rate by 25 basis points to a decade-high of 3.35% and reiterating that further increases would be needed to fight inflation. The Aussie dollar spiked higher, while short term bonds tumbled.

Asian shares held their ground while the rally in the U.S. dollar took a breather on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, a deadly earthquake killed more than 3,700 people across a swathe of Turkey and northwest Syria, sending Turkey's lira to a record low.

Before Powell takes centre stage and hogs the limelight, Bank of England's Huw Pill is also due to speak and his comments on monetary policy will likely move markets.

Key developments that could influence markets on Tuesday:

Economic events: U.K. Halifax house prices for January, Swiss unemployment data

Speakers: Bank of England's Huw Pill, ECB's Peter Kazimir and Klaas Knot and Fed Chair Powell

690,111,Microsoft,2023-02-07,"Microsoft packs Bing search engine, Edge browser with AI in big challenge to Google","













REDMOND, Wash., Feb 7 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is revamping its Bing search engine and Edge Web browser with artificial intelligence, the company said on Tuesday, signaling its ambition to retake the lead in consumer technology markets where it has fallen behind.

The maker of the Windows operating system is staking its future on AI through billions of dollars of investment as it directly challenges Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, which for years has outpaced Microsoft in search and browser technology.

Now, Microsoft is rolling out an intelligent chatbot to live alongside Bing's search results, putting AI that can summarize web pages, synthesize disparate sources, even compose emails and translate them into more consumers' hands. Microsoft expects every percentage point of share it gains will bring in another $2 billion in search advertising revenue.

Working with the startup OpenAI, Microsoft is aiming to leapfrog its Silicon Valley rival and potentially claim vast returns from tools generally that speed up content creation, automating tasks, if not jobs themselves. That would affect products for business, such as the cloud-computing and collaboration tools Microsoft sells, as well as the consumer internet.

""This technology is going to reshape pretty much every software category,"" Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella told reporters in a briefing at the company's headquarters in Redmond, Washington.

The company's share of search so far is about an estimated tenth of the market. Still, many investors see new technology as a win for all players. Microsoft's stock closed 4.2% higher on Tuesday, while Alphabet gained 4.6%.

The power of so-called generative AI that can create virtually any text or image dawned on the public last year with the release of ChatGPT, the chatbot sensation from OpenAI. Its human-like responses to any prompt have given people new ways to think about the possibilities of marketing, writing term papers or disseminating news, or how to query information online.

Microsoft's new Bing search engine is live in limited preview on desktop computers and will be available for mobile devices in coming weeks. The company hopes user feedback will improve its AI, which Microsoft officials said may still produce factually inaccurate information known as a hallucination. It meanwhile has pursued work to safeguard against misuse of its tech.

Underpinning the new Bing is what Microsoft is calling the Prometheus model - OpenAI's most powerful technology informed as needed by real-time web data from Bing. That means Bing's chatbot can brief consumers on current events, a step beyond ChatGPT's answers that currently are limited to data as of 2021.

Jordi Ribas, Microsoft's corporate vice president for search and AI, told Reuters the tech advances his team witnessed last summer emboldened the company to move ahead with an AI-infused Bing.

Microsoft's chief financial officer also said OpenAI's ""new, next-generation"" technology is powering its search engine, though officials declined to specify if this entailed the startup's highly anticipated upgrade known as GPT-4.

FROM BUSINESS TO CONSUMER

Microsoft is aiming to market OpenAI's technology, including ChatGPT, to its cloud customers and add the same power to its entire suite of products, not just search.

A view shows a Microsoft logo at Microsoft France headquarters in Issy-les-Moulineaux near Paris, France, January 25, 2023. REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes

In the near term, Gartner analyst Jason Wong said Microsoft's ""partnership with OpenAI is more relevant for its business customers."" Still, he said, it could offer ""disruptive opportunities"" in consumer businesses as well.

""Except for gaming, Microsoft has not been a leader in key consumer technologies, such as search, mobile and social media,"" he added.

Google has taken note of Microsoft's challenge nonetheless. On Monday it unveiled a chatbot of its own called Bard, while it is planning to release its own AI in search that can synthesize material when no simple answer exists online.

Microsoft's decision to update its Edge browser will likewise intensify competition with Google's Chrome competitor. However, the Redmond-based company expects to roll out the updated Bing to other browsers eventually.

The rivalry in search is now among the technology industry's biggest, as OpenAI sets up Microsoft to expand its 9% share at Google's expense, said Daniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.

For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Alphabet reported $42.6 billion in Google Search and other revenue, while Microsoft posted $3.2 billion from search and news advertising.

PRACTICAL USES

Microsoft executives said the new Bing would change how people find information on the internet.

A chatbot for instance can help users refine queries more easily and give more relevant, up-to-date results.

The AI-driven search engine would be able to give clear answers in plain language, synthesizing what Bing found on the web and in its own data vaults, rather than simply spitting out links to websites. Queries on current events would draw more from live data on the internet.

At the news briefing with reporters, Microsoft Consumer Chief Marketing Officer Yusuf Mehdi demonstrated how the AI-enhanced search engine also could make shopping easier. He showed how Bing could estimate, for example, whether a certain type of seat could fit in the back of a car by pulling together web data on one's vehicle dimensions and on the shopping product in question.

Within the Edge browser, Bing's AI can present takeaways of financial results or other web pages as well, aiming to save readers from having to make sense of a long or complicated document, Microsoft said. It can suggest computer code, too.

Behind these efforts is Microsoft's plan to invest in supercomputer development and cloud support so OpenAI can release still more sophisticated technology and aim at the level of machine intelligence dreamed up in science fiction.

Already, results of this collaboration are manifesting beyond search. Last week Microsoft announced the startup's AI will generate meeting notes in Teams, its collaboration software, as well as suggest email replies to vendors using its Viva Sales subscription.

691,133,Microsoft,2023-02-07,Factbox: How to get Microsoft's new AI-enhanced Bing,"













Feb 7 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Tuesday unveiled a juiced-up version of its Bing search engine and Edge Web browser, powered by an upgraded version of ChatGPT's underlying technology.

The launch is limited to a ""desktop limited preview"" available on Tuesday.

Users will need to go to this link and sign in to a Microsoft account to get on a waitlist to access Bing search.

To jump the line, Microsoft said users can set Bing as the default search engine on their PC and scan a QR code to download the Bing Search app on your phone.

The viral success of OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT, which is on track to be the fastest-growing app in history, has prompted Big Tech companies to rush out new offerings.

Here is how Microsoft has integrated the technology from OpenAI, in which Microsoft first invested in 2019, into Bing and Edge.

During the limited preview stage, users will only be able to try pre-set queries, a Microsoft spokesperson told Reuters. Free-form queries will be available at a later date.

Bing's AI can now sift through search results and synthesize the findings to answer complex queries in a chatbot window. What to replace eggs with in a cake? Microsoft aims to get users the answer without scrolling through multiple results.

The revamped Edge browser features a sidebar with a range of AI features, while another mode allows users to interact with Bing in the familiar ChatGPT-like chat interface.

For more complex searches, such as planning a detailed trip itinerary or researching a TV set to buy, users can refine their search by asking more details through the Bing chat. It will also throw up purchase links to the products and experiences users arrive at.

Bing can generate content like emails - including translations of them - social media posts, job interview notes and even a five-day itinerary for a trip to Hawaii or a quiz for trivia night. It will also cite its sources so consumers can read more on the Web.

The revamped Edge sidebar adds ""chat"" and ""compose"" features. ""Chat"" allows users to summarize any given Web page or document and seek information related to its content. ""Compose"" allows users to generate content for social media posts or emails based on a few prompts.

692,169,Microsoft,2023-02-07,Explainer: Bard vs ChatGPT: What do we know about Google's AI chatbot?,"













Feb 7 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and rival Microsoft (MSFT.O) are once again locked in a race to rule the internet zeitgeist after the Google owner launched ""Bard"" in answer to AI chatbot sensation ChatGPT.

Just minutes after Google announced the launch of Bard on Monday, Microsoft said it would hold an event at its Redmond headquarters to reveal its own AI, potentially setting the stage for the next Chrome-versus-Internet Explorer or Gmail-versus-Hotmail.

Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT has taken the tech world by storm since it was opened for public use last year, as people worldwide got creative with prompts that the conversational chatbot uses to create everything from poems and novels to jokes and film scripts.

The artificial intelligence service could change how consumers search for information or create content on command and free up time for white-collar workers.

Here are some key differences between Bard and ChatGPT:

WHAT DO THEY DO?

The services that Google's Bard and ChatGPT would offer are similar. Users will have to key in a question, a request or give a prompt to receive a human-like response.

Microsoft and Google plan to embed AI tools to bolster their search services Bing and Google Search, which account for a big chunk of revenue.

HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT?

Both technologies can distill complex information and multiple perspectives into easy-to-digest formats, but the most apparent difference is Bard's ability to include recent events in the responses.

Though not immediately clear how the two services will differ, it is certain that Alphabet's Bard will have access to more data.

Bard draws on information from the internet, while ChatGPT has access to data until 2021.

LAMDA VERSUS GPT

Bard is based on LaMDA, short for Language Model for Dialogue Applications. The AI generated text with such skill that a company engineer last year called it sentient, a claim the technology giant and scientists widely dismissed.

OpenAI's GPT, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer, was first released in 2020, and the GPT 3.5 series of language models that finished training in early 2022 is the backbone of ChatGPT.

""ChatGPT sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers,"" Open AI said in a blog post.

WHEN WILL BARD BE AVAILABLE?

While OpenAI made a free research preview of ChatGPT available for public use on Nov. 30 last year, Bard is currently only open to a group of testers.

Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in a blog post that the conversational AI service will be made widely available in the coming weeks.

ARE THERE OTHER ALTERNATIVES?

In the two months after ChatGPT's launch, a number of tech companies have doubled down on generative AI technology, while a number of startups are independently working on their own projects.

Baidu, China's answer to Google, is the latest company to join the frenzy. Its AI is called Ernie.

694,152,Microsoft,2023-02-08,Alphabet shares dive after Google AI chatbot Bard flubs answer in ad,"













LONDON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) lost $100 billion in market value on Wednesday after its new chatbot shared inaccurate information in a promotional video and a company event failed to dazzle, feeding worries that the Google parent is losing ground to rival Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

Alphabet shares slid as much as 9% during regular trading with volumes nearly three times the 50-day moving average. They pared losses after hours and were roughly flat. The stock had lost 40% of its value last year but rallied 15% since the beginning of this year, excluding Wednesday's losses.

Reuters was first to point out an error in Google's advertisement for chatbot Bard, which debuted on Monday, about which satellite first took pictures of a planet outside the Earth's solar system.

Google has been on its heels after OpenAI, a startup Microsoft is backing with around $10 billion, introduced software in November that has wowed consumers and become a fixation in Silicon Valley circles for its surprisingly accurate and well-written answers to simple prompts.

Google's live-streamed presentation on Wednesday morning did not include details about how and when it would integrate Bard into its core search function. A day earlier, Microsoft held an event touting that it had already released to the public a version of its Bing search with ChatGPT functions integrated.

Bard's error was discovered just before the presentation by Google, based in Mountain View, California.

""While Google has been a leader in AI innovation over the last several years, they seemed to have fallen asleep on implementing this technology into their search product,"" said Gil Luria, senior software analyst at D.A. Davidson. ""Google has been scrambling over the last few weeks to catch up on Search and that caused the announcement yesterday (Tuesday) to be rushed and the embarrassing mess up of posting a wrong answer during their demo.""

Microsoft shares rose around 3% on Wednesday, and were flat in post-market trading.

Alphabet posted a short GIF video of Bard in action via Twitter, promising it would help simplify complex topics, but it instead delivered an inaccurate answer.

In the advertisement, Bard is given the prompt: ""What new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can I tell my 9-year old about?"" Bard responds with a number of answers, including one suggesting the JWST was used to take the very first pictures of a planet outside the Earth's solar system, or exoplanets. The first pictures of exoplanets were, however, taken by the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT) in 2004, as confirmed by NASA.

""This highlights the importance of a rigorous testing process, something that we're kicking off this week with our Trusted Tester program,"" a Google spokesperson said. ""We'll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard's responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information.""

FORMIDABLE COMPETITOR

Alphabet is coming off a disappointing fourth quarter as advertisers cut spending.

The search and advertising giant is moving quickly to keep pace with OpenAI and rivals, reportedly bringing in founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page to accelerate its efforts.

""People are starting to question is Microsoft going to be a formidable competitor now against Google's really bread-and-butter business,"" said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Wealth Management, which owns Alphabet and Microsoft shares.

Lip cautioned, though, that concerns about Alphabet may be overblown, saying: ""I think still Bing is a far, far cry away from Google's search capabilities.""

The new ChatGPT software has injected excitement into technology firms after tens of thousands of job cuts in recent weeks and executive pledges to pare back on so-called moonshot projects. AI has become a fixation for tech executives who have mentioned it as much as six times more often on recent earnings calls than in prior quarters, Reuters found.

The appeal of AI-driven search is that it could spit out results in plain language, rather than in a list of links, which could make browsing faster and more efficient. It remains unclear what impact that might have on targeted advertising, the backbone of search engines like Google.

Chatbot AI systems also carry risks for corporations because of inherent biases in their algorithms that can skew results, sexualize images or even plagiarize, as consumers testing the service have discovered. Microsoft, for instance, released a chatbot on Twitter in 2016 that quickly began generating racist content before being shut down. And an AI used by news site CNET was found to produce factually incorrect or plagiarized stories.

At the time of writing, the Bard ad had been viewed on Twitter more than a million times.

Summary

Summary Companies Says AI to enable user interaction in ""entirely new ways""

Highlights Maps, indoor views, image search and translation

Second AI announcement this week

Rival Microsoft also using AI to enhance search

Alphabet shares down 7.8%















STOCKHOLM/LONDON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google on Wednesday said it will enhance search results with generative AI features, in its latest salvo against Microsoft (MSFT.O) which laid out plans a day earlier to improve its rival search engine Bing.

Microsoft is hoping new features can revive its Bing platform and take a shot at Google's dominance of online search which drives a lucrative ad business earning $100 billion in sales last year.

Adding generative AI to search results will create text or visual responses to prompts and enable users to interact with information in ""entirely new ways"", Google said.

""As we continue to bring generative AI technologies into our products, the only limit to search will be your imagination,"" Google's senior vice present Prabhakar Raghavan said at an event in Paris.

It was Google's second announcement this week. On Monday it unveiled its chatbot service Bard, but the launch has faced hiccups as Google's own online ad showed BARD delivering inaccurate answers.

Analysts said Google will be hoping it can prevent users switching to rival Bing.

San Francisco-based OpenAI, backed by Microsoft, opened up its ChatGPT chatbot for free public testing in November. It surged in popularity within days and Microsoft now plans to use the technology to power its Bing search engine.

Google's ad business is Alphabet's biggest earner, accounting for about 80% of the company's annual revenue.

Microsoft said it expects every percentage point of market share it gains will bring in another $2 billion in search advertising revenue.

As the use of artificial intelligence picks up, the European Union is gearing up to regulate it, through its AI Act.

Apart from search, Google also showcased a bunch of improvements to Maps, indoor views, image search and translation -- all using artificial intelligence in some form.

""AI is also making it far more natural to make sense of and explore the real world,"" Raghavan said.

697,713,Microsoft,2023-02-08,Morning Bid: Powell confesses 'This time it's different',"













A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.

Jerome Powell calmed the horses, a bit.

In attempting to parse last week's blockbuster January jobs report, the Federal Reserve Chair on Tuesday reprised his take from last Wednesday's policy meeting - essentially that another couple of Fed rate hikes were probably needed to get across inflation fully, but that it was anyone's guess after that.

Any fear of a radical Fed rethink on the back of the jobs numbers seemed wide of the mark.

After doubting Fed guidance all year, financial markets have taken one look at the strength of the labour market last month and stopped fighting the central bank. They now agree that two more quarter point hikes to just above 5% are in the pipeline by July - jarring stock and bond markets for a couple of days, but not much more.

Despite some high-octane hawkishness from his colleagues - several more of whom are speaking on Wednesday - Powell seemed to reassure investors with some basic honesty about the peculiarity of this business cycle - and the dangers of extrapolating too much from a few data points or overcommitting on future policy moves.

""This cycle is different from other cycles...it has just confounded all sorts of attempts to predict,"" Powell admitted.

There's little doubt that second-guessing recession probabilities over recent months or staying wedded too long fixed assumptions has been less than rewarding. And many think last week's jobs report should similarly be treated with care.

""We believe the data last week does not accurately reflect the U.S. economy. It isn't booming, although it clearly isn't on the verge of recession either,"" Columbia Threadneedle Investments economist Steven Bell wrote on Wednesday.

The upshot is markets are back in wait-and-see mode. Wall St futures have given back a little of Tuesday's surge. Two and 10-year Treasury yields and the dollar edged back lower.

The VIX gauge of U.S. stock volatility (.VIX) remains unusually low, below 19 and below its average of the past 30 years.

Elsewhere, investors digested President Joe Biden's State of the Union speech, in which he challenged Republicans to lift the U.S. debt ceiling and support tax policies that were friendlier to middle class Americans.

Biden hammered corporations for profiteering from the pandemic and ran through a wish list of economic proposals, many of which are unlikely to be passed by Congress. They included a minimum tax for billionaires and a quadrupling of the tax on corporate stock buybacks.

But the U.S. president was especially critical of oil companies' profits on the back of Ukraine's invasion. ""I think it's outrageous,"" Biden said.

And the scale of 'Big Oil's' windfall last year was in evidence around the world yet again on Wednesday.

Norway's Equinor (EQNR.OL) posted a record $74.9 billion adjusted operating profit for 2022, more than double its previous high, as gas prices soared - boosting its share price by 7%. French oil major TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA) posted record net profits of $36.2 billion, also double the previous year.

In tech, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said it was revamping its Bing search engine and Edge Web browser with artificial intelligence, signaling its ambition to retake the lead in consumer technology markets where it has fallen behind.

And in global central banking, Fed hawks weren't alone. The Reserve Bank of India hiked its key repo rate by a quarter percentage point and surprised markets by leaving the door open to more tightening, saying core inflation remained high.

Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday:

* U.S. December wholesale trade sales

* New York Federal Reserve President John Williams, Fed Board Governor Lisa Cook, Fed Board Governor Christopher Waller, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr, Atlanta Fed chief Raphael Bostic, Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari

* U.S. Treasury auctions 10-year notes

* U.S. corp earnings: Disney, CVS, Fox Corp, Uber, CME, Brookfield AM, Emerson Electric, Dominion Energy, MGM resorts, Everest Re, Equifax, Yum! Brands, Eaton Corp, etc

698,530,Microsoft,2023-02-08,"Rethink needed to regulate Big Tech in finance, says BIS official","













LONDON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - A rethink is needed on how to directly regulate activities of Big Tech companies in financial services, given their size and influence, a top official at an international forum for central banks said in Wednesday.

Data-rich Big Tech companies such as Alibaba and Amazon have been involved for some time in financial services such as banking, payments, asset management and insurance, with some also providing cloud computing to run key services for banks.

Their size and reach in social media and e-commerce means they can quickly build up market share in financial activities, Bank for International Settlements General Manager Agustin Carstens said in a speech.

This creates a risk of them becoming ""too big to fail"" - a problem regulators hoped they had solved with banks after bailouts in the financial crisis over a decade ago.

""Without a doubt, a regulatory rethink is warranted, and we need a new path to follow,"" Carstens said, adding a new ""holistic"" framework was needed that included requiring Big Tech financial services to be ring-fenced from other operations.

Their vast troves of data give Big Tech firms valuable information about potential financial services customers, such as their wealth and spending habits. Companies from Jumia in Africa to Grab in southeast Asia are trying to tap into that by providing services such as credit and payments processing.

BIS Big Tech Graphic

Big Tech firms with significant financial activities could also be subject to group-wide requirements on governance, conduct of business and operational resilience, Carstens said.

Implementing ""holistic"" financial rules for Big Tech would be challenging given the sector is already overseen by data privacy and competition regulators locally and internationally, with no obvious ""lead"" regulator, he added.

Operational resilience rules are already emerging in the European Union, Britain and elsewhere to give financial regulators oversight on the use by banks and insurers of outside cloud computing firms like Amazon, IBM and Microsoft to host services.

Microsoft's $2 billion deal with London Stock Exchange Group in December was the latest sign of how boundaries between Big Tech and finance are blurring.

BIS Big Tech Graphic 2

The potential benefits of Big Tech firms' entry into finance include improved customer outcomes, increased financial market efficiency and enhanced financial inclusion, Carstens said. ""It is high time to move from theory to practice and consider tangible options for regulatory actions.""

699,60,Microsoft,2023-02-08,Microsoft calls for 'coalition' to improve Congo's informal cobalt mines,"













CAPE TOWN, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Microsoft visited an artisanal cobalt mine in Democratic Republic of Congo in December as part of attempts to jump-start formalisation of the little-regulated and dangerous industry that experts say is key to meeting global demand for the battery material.

Congo accounts for three-quarters of the world's mined cobalt supply. Industrial mines produce most of Congo's cobalt, but ""artisanal"" miners, who dig by hand and often die when tunnels cave in, account for up to 30% of production, though that fluctuates depending on price.

In the first known visit by a Microsoft (MSFT.O) executive to an artisanal cobalt site in Congo, chief of staff for tech and corporate responsibility Michele Burlington met miners at Mutoshi, where commodities trader Trafigura had helped run a formalisation scheme that ended in 2020.

Companies that use cobalt in products from electric cars to smartphones should work to improve conditions at artisanal mines instead of seeking to cut artisanal cobalt out of their supply chains, an independent report on the visit argued on Wednesday.

""Electric vehicle manufacturers and electronics companies are operating with one eye open and one eye closed,"" said Dorothee Baumann Pauly, director of the Geneva Center for Business and Human Rights, who wrote the report.

""In practice it is virtually impossible for them to completely exclude artisanal cobalt, especially when it is sent to smelters and refiners in DRC and China.""

Microsoft declined to reply to Reuters' questions about the visit or about its strategy on artisanal cobalt. In the report, Microsoft said that it is ""committed to responsible and ethical sourcing"".

""We are continuing to work on this problem. It's an issue that will take a coalition to solve,"" the $1.9 trillion computer manufacturer and software company said.

As consumers become more concerned that the products they buy are tainted by poor working conditions or child labour, global tech firms and carmakers have been using less mined cobalt in their batteries by increasing recycling and switching to lower-cobalt chemistries. read more

Apple, for example, aims to massively reduce its use of all materials sourced directly from mines, and has said that 13% of the cobalt shipped in its products in 2021 came from recycling.

The issues around artisanal mining are an existential threat to the cobalt industry, according to Marina Demidova, head of communications at the Cobalt Institute. ""If we get this wrong, cobalt probably will cease to be in batteries in 20 years' time.""

So far, attempts to formalise the industry have fallen flat.

Trafigura and Congo mining firm Chemaf's formalisation scheme at Mutoshi, launched in 2018, ended abruptly in March 2020 with the coronavirus pandemic. Now diggers work in deep tunnels with no personal protective equipment, and women miners said they make less money than before, according to the report.

Entreprise Generale du Cobalt, a unit of state mining company Gecamines, was granted a monopoly on artisanal cobalt by government decree. EGC signed a supply deal with Trafigura in November 2020 and published a sourcing standard, but has yet to start buying cobalt due to political wrangling.

""Greater stakeholder engagement, including from global buyers, will help to overcome this impasse,"" Baumann-Pauly said.

700,513,Microsoft,2023-02-08,U.S. Treasury urges financial firms to examine cloud services,"













WASHINGTON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Department officials highlighted several challenges facing financial firms that are increasingly turning to cloud computing services to support a range of their activities, warning in a report on Wednesday that failure to address them could leave lingering vulnerabilities.

The risk was particularly acute for small and medium-sized financial institutions, the department said.

Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo said while ""there is no question that providing consumers with secure and reliable financial services means greater demand for cloud-based technologies,” there needed to be ""safe and effective migration"" as banks and other financial companies adopt cloud services.

""Treasury found that cloud services could help financial institutions become more resilient and secure, but that there were some significant challenges that could detract from these benefits,"" department officials wrote in their report assessing current cloud adoption in the financial industry.

Those issues include financial firms' exposure to potential cyber incidents, an industry-wide reliance on a small number of cloud providers and a lack of technology workers able to help financial institutions deploy cloud services, among other challenges, department officials said.

The report also noted that the patchwork global rules made it ""nearly impossible"" for larger firms to consistently adopt cloud systems globally.

For example, financial firms and cloud service providers in the European Union are facing stricter rules, and will need to show how quickly they could recover from a cyber attack under a law due to take effect at the end of 2024. read more

Treasury officials recommended steps that could help the sector adopt cloud computing, adding that it ""neither endorses nor discourages cloud service adoption by the sector.""

The banking industry was generally supportive of the report. The Bank Policy Institute, which represents larger banks, said in a statement it welcomed collaboration with government officials on bolstering cloud adoption and addressing risks.

The department was establishing a working group to address the challenges raised in the report and said it would work with U.S. financial regulators, the industry and international partners to address the risks.

Technology companies that provide cloud computing services include Amazon Inc's (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services, Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Oracle Corp (ORCL.N).

Summary

Summary Companies Deal raises concerns- regulator

Acquisition threatens Xbox and PlayStation rivalry

Microsoft says committed to addressing concerns















LONDON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Britain placed another hurdle in the way of Microsoft's (MSFT.O) $69-billion mega purchase of ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O), saying it could harm gamers by weakening the rivalry between Xbox and Sony's PlayStation.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Wednesday the biggest-ever deal in gaming, announced a year ago, could result in higher prices, fewer choices and less innovation for millions of players, as well as stifling competition in cloud gaming.

It said Activision's flagship ""Call of Duty"" franchise was important in driving competition between consoles, and Microsoft could benefit by making the game exclusive to Xbox, or only available on PlayStation under materially worse conditions.

The deal is being scrutinised in the United States and Europe as well as in Britain, where the CMA showed its willingness to take-on big tech in 2021 when it blocked Facebook-owner Meta's acquisition of Giphy.

In December, the United States moved to block the deal, citing Microsoft's record of hoarding valuable gaming content. The Federal Trade Commission has set a hearing before a judge for August this year.

The EU is also preparing a statement of objections about the deal, sources told Reuters last month.

Alex Haffner, competition partner at law firm Fladgate, said the CMA's comments suggested that structural commitments, such as asset sales, might be the only way to allay its concerns.

""This would obviously call into question the strategic rationale for the deal,"" Haffner said. ""Microsoft faces a stiff challenge to get the global regulatory green light.""

Microsoft has pledged to keep ""Call of Duty"" on PlayStation. The popularity of the first-person shooter franchise is undimmed nearly two decades after launch, with the latest instalment achieving $1 billion sales in its first 10 days in October.

But the U.S. tech giant has said the deal is about more than ""Call of Duty"".

It has said buying the company that also makes ""Overwatch"" and ""Candy Crush"" would charge its growth in mobile, PC, and cloud gaming, as well as consoles, helping it compete with the likes of Tencent as well as Sony.

Sony, however, has led opposition to the deal, saying last year that it was ""bad for competition, bad for the gaming industry and bad for gamers themselves.""

CROSSFIRE

The CMA investigation's chair Martin Coleman said his job was to make sure that British gamers were not caught in the crossfire of global deals that could damage competition and result in higher prices, fewer choices, or less innovation.

""We have provisionally found that this may be the case here,"" he said.

Shares in Activision were down 3% in early trading in New York. Microsoft, which announced an AI-driven revamp of its search capabilities on Tuesday, was up 2.4%.

Microsoft said it would address the CMA's concerns.

""Our commitment to grant long-term 100% equal access to ' Call of Duty' to Sony, Nintendo, Steam and others preserves the deal's benefits to gamers and developers and increases competition in the market,"" its Deputy General Counsel Rima Alaily said.

Activision Blizzard said the findings were provisional and it hoped to help the regulator better understand the industry before it issues a final report by April 26.

REUTERS/Aly Song















SHANGHAI, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Alibaba Group (9988.HK), on Wednesday said it is developing a ChatGPT-style tool that is currently in internal testing, joining a race by tech companies globally to show they are up to speed on generative artificial intelligence (AI) developments.

The Chinese e-commerce group's statement came after the 21st Century Herald newspaper reported that Alibaba is developing a ChatGPT-like dialogue robot which is currently open to employees for testing.

When asked about the newspaper report, which also said that Alibaba might combine the technology with the group’s communication app DingTalk, Alibaba declined to comment.

The company said it had been focused on large language models and generative AI for a number of years. Large language models are natural language processing systems which are trained on massive volumes of text, and are capable of answering and comprehending questions as well as generating new text.

Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares rose 3.2% premarket after the news.

Shares in a number of other Chinese AI technology companies have soared in the past few days due to investor excitement over Open.Ai's ChatGPT, which can generate articles, essays and jokes in response to prompts and has been rated the fastest-growing consumer app in history.

Shares in Chinese search engine giant Baidu (9988.HK) jumped by 15% on Tuesday after it said it planned to complete testing of its ""Ernie bot"" in March. Google owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) is also planning its own chatbot service and said it will use more artificial intelligence for its search engine.

Microsoft (MSFT.O), which owns Open.AI, plans to tie ChatGPT in with its search engine Bing.

On Wednesday, another Chinese tech group JD.com (9618.HK), said it was looking to integrate some methods and technology similar to ChatGPT's into some of its products, such as its e-commerce platform's customer service.

A source familiar with NetEase (9999.HK), told Reuters that the Chinese gaming company plans to deploy similar large language models technology to serve its education business.

703,690,Microsoft,2023-02-09,Morning Bid: Corporate scatter,"













A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.

A hail of mega corporate updates distracted stock markets from a confusing macro picture - but offers little more clarity with scattergun fortunes and ambiguous readouts for the wider economy.

Shares in Walt Disney (DIS.N) surged 6% ahead of Thursday's open after the firm announced a sweeping restructuring under reinstated CEO Bob Iger and cut 7,000 jobs - 3.6% of its workforce - in an effort to save $5.5 billion and make its streaming business profitable.

Disney's job shedding is yet another sign that January's red-hot U.S. employment reading may not be the full picture as company apes many big tech and digital firms in downsizing its staff this year.

The share price reaction, however, was in contrast to the bizarre Alphabet swoon on Wednesday.

Alphabet (GOOGL.O) lost 9% - or over $100 billion in market value - after its new chatbot shared inaccurate information in a promotional video at an underwhelming company event. The flub fed worries that the Google parent is losing ground to rival Microsoft (MSFT.O) in the renewed craze around artificial intelligence.

Fears over ailing Swiss bank Credit Suisse(CSGN.S) dominated in Europe. Its shares dropped 5% after it reported its worst annual loss since the 2008 global financial crisis and warned of a further ""substantial"" loss this year. The mood didn't improve even as it marked out another step towards creating a standalone investment bank by buying Michael Klein's advisory boutique for $175 million.

For inflation worriers, consumer goods firms bear close watching. Unilever (ULVR.L) said on Thursday it would continue to raise prices for its detergents, soaps and packaged food to offset rising input costs but the pace of price rises was slowing and would ease up more in the second half of 2023.

Price increases would continue in the second half ""but it will be a lower rates of increases...we are probably past peak inflation, but not yet past peak pricing,"" finance chief Graeme Pitkethly said.

That disinflation drum continued to beat in Germany, where consumer prices inflation fell more than anticipated last month, easing back below the 10% expected to 9.2% on the year.

Sweden's central bank emphasised that rising global interest rates were still some way from their peaks as it raised its key rate by half a percentage point to 3.0%, forecasting more to come.

Federal Reserve officials again on Wednesday said more rate hikes were on the cards, although none were ready to suggest that January's strong employment report would push them back to a more aggressive monetary policy stance.

Moving to a funds rate of between 5.00% and 5.25% ""seems a very reasonable view,"" said New York Fed chief John Williams.

More generally, U.S. stock futures were higher on Thursday, with Treasury yields and the dollar falling back. European shares touched a fresh nine-month high on Thursday as Germany's Siemens and UK's AstraZeneca boosted earnings euphoria, while Britain's bank, commodity and pharma heavy FTSE100 hit another record high.

The share in troubled Indian giant Adani took another negative twist. Financial index provider MSCI said some Adani securities should no longer be designated as free float, after market participants raised concerns about the eligibility of the Indian conglomerate's companies for some of its indexes.

Norway's $1.35 trillion sovereign wealth fund said it had recently divested virtually all its remaining shares in the Adani group.

Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Thursday:

* U.S. weekly jobless claims

* Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, European Central Bank board member Luis de Guindos speak

* European Union summit

* U.S. Treasury auctions 30-year bond

* U.S. corp earnings: AbbVie, PepsiCo, S&P Global, PayPal, Apollo, Hilton, Expedia, News Corp, Ralph Lauren, Lyft, Kellogg, Motorola Solutions, Mohawk Industries, Philip Morris, Huntington Ingalls, Duke Energy, Wills Towers Watson

Summary Companies Dow down 0.73%, S&P 500 down 0.88%, Nasdaq down 1.02%

Weak demand for $21 bln sale of 30-year Treasury bonds

PepsiCo gains on quarterly profit, sales beat

Disney beats earnings estimates but ends down

Salesforce rises on reports Third Point owns stake















Feb 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes ended lower on Thursday, erasing earlier gains as Treasury yields rose after an auction of 30-year bonds went poorly and overshadowed strong earnings from corporate giants like Disney and PepsiCo.

""The stock market started today's session with a distinct bullish bias, but then Treasury yields moved up and that took some of the steam out of the positive market today,"" said Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Albion Financial Group in Salt Lake City, Utah. He said investors were also still digesting recent comments from Fed officials.

Yields on the U.S. 30-year note rose after the Treasury Department saw weak demand for a $21 billion sale, the final sale of $96 billion in coupon-bearing supply this week. In a note to clients, Jefferies said ""the buyside bid failed to come together.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 249.13 points on Thursday, or 0.73%, to 33,699.88, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 36.36 points, or 0.88%, to 4,081.5 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 120.94 points, or 1.02%, to 11,789.58.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.49 billion shares, compared with the 11.93 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

""With Treasury yields higher, it becomes a legitimate alternative to equities,"" said Michael Rosen, chief investment officer at Angeles Investments.

Wall Street's three main indexes opened higher on Thursday after data showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 196,000 last week, above a forecast of 190,000 claims.

The data tentatively eased concerns about the Federal Reserve's rate-hike path after a strong January employment report rattled markets last week.

Weighing on the S&P 500 (.SPX) and Nasdaq (.IXIC) indexes, Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) extended losses from the previous session to fall 4.7%. All 11 S&P 500 sectors posted losses.

The Google parent's new chatbot shared inaccurate information on Wednesday, feeding worries that it is losing ground to rival Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

Disney Co (DIS.N) beat earnings estimates and announced job cuts, encouraging activist investor Nelson Peltz to terminate his quest for a board seat. Still, it ended down 1.27%.

Salesforce Inc (CRM.N) rose 2.38% on reports that hedge fund Third Point LLC owns a stake in the company.

Stocks have enjoyed an upbeat start to the year on hopes that the Fed will abandon its hawkish rhetoric and pilot the economy to a soft landing.

Traders are betting that the Fed will raise its benchmark rate to a peak of 5.1% in July, largely in line with the forecasts of Fed officials.

PepsiCo Inc (PEP.O) rose 0.95% as the snack and beverage maker reported better-than-expected results, while drugmaker AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) gained 2.82% after beating fourth-quarter profit expectations.

Tapestry Inc (TPR.N) soared 3.47% on a strong annual profit forecast.

More than half of the S&P 500 companies have reported quarterly earnings so far, and 69% of them have beaten estimates, according to Refinitiv data.

Cardiovascular Systems Inc (CSII.O) soared 48.38% after Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) said it would buy the medical device maker for $837.6 million. Abbott fell 1.93%.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.74-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.37-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 75 new highs and 57 new lows.

705,673,Microsoft,2023-02-09,"Chinese state media, AI companies warn of risks in ChatGPT stock frenzy","













SHANGHAI, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Chinese state media on Thursday cautioned against risks in chasing local ChatGPT-concept stocks, while domestic artificial intelligence (AI) companies urged investors to be rational after their soaring share prices caught regulators' attention.

ChatGPT, a chatbot developed by U.S. firm OpenAI and backed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), gives strikingly human-like responses to user queries. Frenzy around the technology launched at November-end has seen shares of Beijing Haitian Ruisheng Science Technology Ltd (688787.SS) soar 217% this year.

Hanwang Technology Co Ltd (002362.SZ) has risen as much as 129% as of Wednesday, CloudWalk Technology Co Ltd (688327.SS) 128% and TRS Information Technology Co Ltd (300229.SZ) 66%.

The stocks retreated on Thursday after the state media warning as well as a slump in Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) shares that wiped out $100 billion in market value after the Google parent's ChatGPT rival shared inaccurate information. read more

In a front-page editorial, the Securities Times highlighted several technological concepts that previously spurred stock buying in China - such as fifth-generation telecommunications networks (5G), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and anti-virus garments - the excitement for which has died down.

Though some hotly chased concepts have been successful, ""many more new ideas haven't been commercialised, or require more time to prove,"" the state-backed newspaper said.

""However, some people avidly speculate on fake concepts, luring others into schemes of pumps and dumps. Investors eventually end up in tears so they should not follow.""

Companies developing ChatGPT-like concepts have also flagged risks at the request of regulators after their prices shot up amid intense interest in generative AI - technology that can generate new data and media such as text and images.

Beijing Haitian Ruisheng Science Technology said its ChatGPT-style products and services do not yet generate revenue, and that it has no relationship with OpenAI.

Though such technology ""is on a long-term uptrend, we need to analyse its speed of growth, and effect, in a cool-headed way,"" it said in a filing in response to queries from the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

The company said it expects a roughly 50% slump in 2022 net profit, and admonished investors to be cautious as its valuation is currently much higher than the industry average.

360 Security Technology Co Inc (601360.SS), in response to regulators' queries, said its self-developed ChatGPT-related technology is still at a nascent stage and is used only internally as a productivity tool.

It is uncertain about when it can market ChatGPT-style products, and how effective they will be, so ""we advise investors to pay attention to market trading risks, decide rationally, and invest cautiously.""

Among deep-pocketed Chinese firms joining the latest chatbot race, e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (9988.HK), on Wednesday said it is developing a ChatGPT-style tool, while rival JD.com Inc (9618.HK) said it aims to integrate ChatGPT-like technology into some products.

Gaming major NetEase Inc (9999.HK), plans to deploy similar ""large language model"" technology in its education business, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.

706,573,Microsoft,2023-02-09,Twitter gets EU yellow card for disinformation reporting effort,"













BRUSSELS, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's Twitter was hit with a yellow card from the European Commission on Thursday as its reported efforts to tackle disinformation fell short of those by Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google, Meta Platforms (META.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and TikTok.

The companies presented progress reports on compliance with a beefed up European Union (EU) code of practice on disinformation in the last six months.

The reports included data on how much advertising revenue the companies had averted from disinformation actors, the number or value of political advertisements accepted or rejected and instances of manipulative behaviours detected.

The European Commission last year linked the code to new online content rules known as the Digital Services Act which allows regulators to fine companies as much as 6% of their global turnover for breaches.

Commission Vice-President for Values and Transparency Vera Jourova singled out Twitter for criticism.

Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

""I am disappointed to see that Twitter's report lags behind others and I expect a more serious commitment to their obligations stemming from the Code,"" Jourova said in a statement.

The EU executive said Twitter's report lacked data and did not contain information on commitments to empower fact checkers.

EU industry chief Thierry Breton warned of hefty sanctions for non-compliance.

""It is in the interest of all signatories to abide by their commitment to fully implement the code of practice against disinformation, in anticipation of the obligations under the Digital Services Act,"" he said.

Activist NGO Avaaz said Big Tech was falling short.

""The circus at Twitter is undermining the very foundations of the code. They've set the bar so low that nobody's looking at the failures of other platforms,"" its campaign director Luca Nicotra said.

""Google's made zero progress in collaborating with fact-checkers and is really behind on transparency and access to data. TikTok is trying to catch up but their algorithm is still massively accelerating disinformation. Despite some progress, Meta's sheer size means they're often still one of the biggest source of disinformation,"" he said.

Google said it was committed to making the code a success. Meta said it had invested heavily in its efforts and that its teams continue to work to improve its approach. TikTok said in a blogpost that it will ramp up its efforts.

The next reports are due in July. The signatories to the code on Thursday launched a transparency centre allowing EU citizens, researchers and NGOs to access online information about their efforts combating disinformation.

707,550,Microsoft,2023-02-09,"AMD wins nearly a third of processor market, Arm's climb slows: analyst report","













Feb 9 (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) has captured nearly a third of the market for central processor units while British chip technology firm Arm Ltd's rise in the PC market slowed in the fourth quarter of 2022, according to an analyst report.

AMD has grabbed share away from Intel Corp (INTC.O), which still remains the largest player in the market for what are known as x86 processors, which work with popular operating systems like Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Windows. In the fourth quarter, Intel had 68.7% market share for x86 processors versus AMD's 31.3%, which was up from 28.5% a year earlier, according to Mercury Research.

The results came amid what Mercury Research President Dean McCarron said in the report was the worst downturn in the PC chip market since the 1980s and possibly the worst in the industry's history. After snapping up PCs and laptops for working from home during the pandemic, consumers and businesses have slowed their purchases amid rising inflation and economic uncertainty.

But the slowdown has played out differently for AMD and Intel. AMD last month beat Wall Street sales expectations while Intel conceded that it has ""stumbled"" in competing with its longtime rival, with Intel's expected losses forcing broad employee pay cuts.

AMD declined to comment on the analyst report. Arm was not immediately available for comment.

But the PC sales slump has also affected Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) Mac computer lineup, which is the leading source of sales for Arm-based PC chips.

Mercury said Arm PC chips, led by Apple's in-house chips but also joined by Qualcomm Inc's (QCOM.O) recent PC chips for Windows machines, now have 13.3% share of the market PC chips, down from 14.6% a quarter earlier but still up from 10.3% share a year ago.

Arm, which is owned by Japan's Softbank Group Corp (9984.T), licenses its technology to companies like Apple and Qualcomm to make into PC chips and has made expansion into new markets like PCs a major part of is sales growth strategy ahead of an expected initial public offering later this year.

708,210,Microsoft,2023-02-09,Euronext has no plans to copy rivals with cloud computing deal,"













LONDON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Euronext will not mimic rivals by shifting critical services to outside cloud computers given regulatory concerns, the pan-European exchange's chief executive Stephane Boujnah said.

London Stock Exchange Group, CME and Nasdaq have all announced partnerships with cloud computing giants like Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft, with Deutsche Boerse joining them on Thursday in a ""strategic partnership"" with Google.

""One of the reasons why we are cautious about the use of data centres of Microsoft, Google and Amazon for critical parts of what we do is because our core supervisors and regulators are themselves very cautious,"" Boujnah told Reuters on Thursday.

Euronext only uses a cloud provider for storing historical data, he said.

""When it comes to strategic applications such as real-time data and operations of the market, we do not want them to be stored and operated by the data centres of companies which have decision-making centres outside the EU, and physical infrastructure outside the EU,"" Boujnah added.

Euronext said earlier on Thursday it has postponed until further notice a weekly report on positions held in its commodity derivatives, as disruption from a ransomware attack on financial data firm ION Group outside the bloc continued.

""We analyse very carefully the dependency on certain providers,"" Boujnah said as Euronext reported full year earnings.

Earlier this week, the Bank for International Settlements said a ""rethink"" is needed on regulating how finance is becoming increasingly dependent on outside parties like cloud firms, which new EU rules will address.

Euronext reported record full-year 2022 revenue and income of 1.418 billion euros ($1.52 billion), up 9.3% on 2021 due to consolidating its acquisition of Borsa Italiana.

Adjusted earnings per share in 2022 was down 4.8% at 5.21 euros due to higher share count, and the company proposes to pay a dividend of 2.22 euros per share.

Euronext said it has increased its 2024 annual pre-tax savings related to integrating Borsa Italiana by 15 million euros to 115 million, with around 70 million of this achieved by the end of 2023 as implementation costs remain unchanged.

The savings are nearly double what was promised at the deal's outset.

""This further demonstrates Euronext's successful track record in integrating acquired companies,"" Boujnah said.

709,139,Microsoft,2023-02-09,Fear of complacency costs Alphabet $150 billion,"













NEW YORK, Feb 9 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Alphabet’s (GOOGL.O) new chatbot played a little trick this week. The artificial intelligence program made a mistake when answering a question, and a big unveiling of new AI features for search on Wednesday fell flat. The market wiped about $150 billion off the $1.2 trillion company’s market capitalization as a result. That’s probably an overreaction, but any perception Google has become complacent could be hard to shake.

Google had been testing out its bot for a bit, and just as it was presenting on Wednesday, a Reuters story revealed that a question it answered in an advertisement was erroneous. That, plus an underwhelming launch, sent the stock down 11% between Tuesday night and Thursday morning trading. A day earlier, rival Microsoft (MSFT.O) unveiled and released a version of its search engine loaded with AI that can answer complex questions using multiple sources of information.

Microsoft, no small competitor, hopes being better will result in a more competitive search market. Chief Executive Satya Nadella said the gross margin in that industry will drop forever in an interview with the Financial Times. If he’s right, Alphabet has an existential problem. Gross margin was 55% last year, pulling in $157 billion. Cut this figure in half, and Alphabet’s earnings could disappear without serious cost cutting.

Still, a disruptive and successful launch of AI in search is at this point theoretical, and Alphabet’s business is secure for now. It dominates, with over a 90% share of search globally, according to Statcounter. Good technology is a proven disruptor, but incumbency has long had strong advantages. Habits die hard, customers are lazy, and costs to switch are high. Google, Microsoft, Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O) still control their respective niches.

Perceived threats are harder to shake. Microsoft knows this well. In the decade before Nadella become chief executive in 2014, earnings more than doubled. Yet investors worried Microsoft was more concerned with squeezing customers than beating back online competitors. The firm’s earnings multiple was cut in half to about 10. The shares barely moved for a decade, until Nadella’s cloud services push changed the narrative.

Since then, Microsoft’s stock has increased dramatically – shares are worth 10 times more than in 2004. A lull might not be so bad at Alphabet if it ultimately had the same outcome, but for shareholders, the uncertainty is painful.

CONTEXT NEWS

Alphabet’s stock fell over 7% on Feb. 8 and was down over 4% on the morning of Feb. 9 as of 11 a.m. ET (4 p.m. GMT) after an underwhelming reveal of its new plans for using artificial intelligence. Just as the company was presenting its new AI features for search, Reuters reported that an advertisement it had made for a related AI-powered bot named Bard gave a misleading answer to a question. The machine said the James Web Space Telescope took the very first picture of an exoplanet. A European satellite took the first picture 18 years earlier.

On Feb. 7, Microsoft held an event that unveiled new versions of its search engine and web browser that incorporate artificial intelligence. The company has released a version of its Bing search engine using the technology.

BERLIN, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates believes ChatGPT, a chatbot that gives strikingly human-like responses to user queries, is as significant as the invention of the internet, he told German business daily Handelsblatt in an interview published on Friday.

""Until now, artificial intelligence could read and write, but could not understand the content. The new programs like ChatGPT will make many office jobs more efficient by helping to write invoices or letters. This will change our world,"" he said, in comments published in German.

ChatGPT, developed by U.S. firm OpenAI and backed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), has been rated the fastest-growing consumer app in history.

711,310,Microsoft,2023-02-10,"ChatGPT, other AI models to disrupt Indian IT firms - JPM","













Feb 10 (Reuters) - Generative AI models such as ChatGPT will slow down market share gains and deflate pricing for Indian IT companies in the short term, analysts at J.P.Morgan said on Friday.

As generative AI is implemented more broadly, consulting firms like Accenture and Deloitte and will gain market share over Indian IT firms like Infosys Ltd (INFY.NS) and Wipro Ltd (WIPR.NS) in the near term, analysts at the brokerage said in a note to clients.

Generative AI can be a ""deflation driver"" in the near term on legacy services as they compete on pricing, necessitate staff retraining and drive loss of competitiveness, they added.

""ChatGPT is likely to deflate legacy services the most and application services the least.""

Artificial intelligence company OpenAI's chatbot has dazzled amateurs and industry experts with its ability to spit out haikus, debug code and answer questions while imitating human speech, helping it attract a $10 billion investment from Microsoft Inc (MSFT.O) earlier this month.

Since then, other large tech companies like Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and China's Baidu Inc (9888.HK) have rushed to announce their own in-house developments of generative AI.

JPM said that among Indian IT companies, Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS.NS) might retrain staff faster than smaller peers due to their better graduate hiring and training infrastructure.

BEIJING, Feb 23 (Reuters) - The global buzz around Microsoft chatbot ChatGPT has spread to China, shoring up stocks in artificial intelligence (AI) related firms and prompting a flurry of local companies to announce rival projects.

Like Microsoft and Google，Chinese tech giants such as Baidu and Alibaba (9988.HK) as well as smaller start-ups have been working on AI projects for years.

Chatbots in China mostly focus on social interactions whereas ChatGPT, which learns from vast amounts of data how to answer prompts by users in a human-like manner, performs better at more professional tasks, such as programming and essay writing.

Here is a list of Chinese tech companies that have recently made announcements on AI technology:

BAIDU

Baidu Inc (9888.HK) said on Feb. 7 it would complete internal testing of a ChatGPT-style project called ""Ernie Bot"" in March.

On Feb. 22, Baidu CEO Robin Li said the company would use Ernie Bot to create a ""revolutionary"" version of its search engine and eventually build an AI ecosystem around the chatbot.

It plans to also incorporate the chatbot into its cloud services, autonomous platform Apollo's smart cockpit as well as voice assistant Xiaodu.

More than 400 companies, from Chinese state media outlets to a Shaolin temple, have signed up to join the Ernie Bot community as early users of the app.

ALIBABA

Alibaba Group (9988.HK) on Feb. 8 said it is developing a ChatGPT-style tool currently in internal testing. The e-commerce giant said large language models and generative AI have been areas of focus since it formed its research institute Damo Academy in 2017.

TENCENT

Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) said on Feb. 9 is conducting research on the ChatGPT-tool technology and the firm will continue to invest in AI research based on its current technical reserves in foundation model, machine learning algorithms and natural language processing.

FUDAN UNIVERSITY TEAM

A team from China's Fudan University launched a ChatGPT-like chatbot they called MOSS on Feb. 20. The platform, however, crashed hours after its launch due a surge in traffic and the team apologised, saying it was a very immature model that had a long way to go before reaching the level of ChatGPT.

JD.COM

E-commerce company JD.Com (9618.HK) said on Feb. 10 it plans to launch a product similar to ChatGPT that it said would be called ChatJD and will be aimed at serving other businesses.

CHINA TELECOM

China Telecom Corp (0728.HK) is developing an industrial version of ChatGPT for telecommunications, which will use AI in some customer service functions, local Chinese media reported on Feb. 18.

NETEASE

Gaming firm NetEase (9999.HK) plans to deploy large language models technology to serve its education business, a source familiar with the company told Reuters on Feb. 8.

360 SECURITY TECHNOLOGY INC

360 Security Technology Inc (601360.SS) said on Feb. 8 it possessed language model technology but that it could not give a clear indication on when it would launch any related products.

KUAISHOU TECHNOLOGY

Short video app Kuaishou Technology (1024.HK) is conducting research on large language models, which it will use to improve its products such as AI customer service, the government-backed the Paper reported on Feb. 9.

INSPUR ELECTRONIC INFORMATION INDUSTRY

Inspur Electronic Information Industry (000977.SZ) said on its investors relation website that it has long invested in AI-Generated Content (AIGC) from arithmetic, algorithms to the application of the technology.

KUNLUN TECH

Beijing based-mobile games firm Kunlun Tech said it planned to launch a Chinese version of ChatGPT this year whose code will be open source, the company said on its WeChat account on Thursday.

The company said in a separate statement that on Wednesday it will embed ChatGPT into its Norway-based web browser Opera.

HONG KONG, Feb 10 (Reuters) - (This Feb.10 story has been corrected to say Ding Daoshi is a former Sootoo director, not current)

Microsoft-backed OpenAI has kept its hit ChatGPT app off-limits to users in China, but the app is attracting huge interest in the country, with firms rushing to integrate the technology into their products and launch rival solutions.

While residents in the country are unable to create OpenAI accounts to access the artificial intelligence-powered (AI) chatbot, virtual private networks and foreign phone numbers are helping some bypass those restrictions.

At the same time, the OpenAI models behind the ChatGPT programme, which can write essays, recipes and complex computer code, are relatively accessible in China and increasingly being incorporated into Chinese consumer technology applications from social networks to online shopping.

The tool's surging popularity is rapidly raising awareness in China about how advanced U.S. AI is and, according to analysts, just how far behind tech firms in the world's second-largest economy are as they scramble to catch up.

""There is huge excitement around ChatGPT. Unlike the metaverse which faces huge difficulty in finding real-life application, ChatGPT has suddenly helped us achieve human-computer interaction,"" said Ding Daoshi, an independent internet analyst and former director of Beijing-based consultancy Sootoo. ""The changes it will bring about are more immediate, more direct and way quicker.""

OpenAI or ChatGPT itself is not blocked by Chinese authorities but OpenAI does not allow users in mainland China, Hong Kong, Iran, Russia and parts of Africa to sign up.

OpenAI told Reuters it is working to make its services more widely available.

“While we would like to make our technology available everywhere, conditions in certain countries make it difficult or impossible for us to do so in a way that is consistent with our mission,"" the San Francisco-based firm said in an emailed statement. ""We are currently working to increase the number of locations where we can provide safe and beneficial access to our tools.""

In December, Tencent Holdings' (0700.HK) WeChat, China's biggest messaging app, shut several ChatGPT-related programmes that had appeared on the network, according to local media reports, but they have continued to spring up.

Dozens of bots rigged to ChatGPT technology have emerged on WeChat, with hobbyists using it to make programmes or automated accounts that can interact with users. At least one account charges users a fee of 9.99 yuan ($1.47) to ask 20 questions.

Tencent did not respond to Reuters' request for comments.

ChatGPT supports Chinese language interaction and is highly capable of conversing in Chinese, which has helped drive its unofficial adoption in the country.

Chinese firms also use proxy tools or existing partnerships with Microsoft, which is investing billions of dollars in its OpenAI, to access tools that allow them to embed AI technology into their products.

Shenzhen-based Proximai in December introduced a virtual character into its 3D game-like social app who used ChatGPT's underlying tech to converse. Beijing-based entertainment software company Kunlun Tech plans to incorporate ChatGPT in its web browser Opera.

SleekFlow, a Tiger Global-backed startup in Hong Kong, said it was integrating the AI into its customer relations messaging tools.

""We have clients all over the world,"" Henson Tsai, SleekFlow's founder said. ""Among other things, ChatGPT does excellent translations, sometimes better than other solutions available on the market.""

CENSORSHIP

Reuters' tests of ChatGPT indicate that the chatbot is not averse to questions that would be sensitive in mainland China. Asked for its thoughts on Chinese President Xi Jinping, for instance, it responded it does not have personal opinions and presented a range of views.

But some of its proxy bots on WeChat have blacklisted such terms, according to other Reuters checks, complying with China's heavy censorship of its cyberspace. When asked the same question about Xi on one ChatGPT proxy bot, it responded by saying that the conversation violated rules.

To comply with Chinese rules, Proximai's founder Will Duan said his platform would filter information presented to users during their interaction with ChatGPT.

Chinese regulators, which last year introduced rules to strengthen governance of ""deepfake"" technology, have not commented on ChatGPT, however, state media this week warned about stock market risks amid a frenzy over local ChatGPT-concept stocks.

The Cyberspace Administration of China, the internet regulator, did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.

""With the regulations released last year, the Chinese government is saying: we already see this technology coming and we want to be ahead of the curve,"" said Rogier Creemers, an assistant professor at Leiden University.

""I fully expect the great majority of the AI-generated content to be non-political.""

CHINESE RIVALS

Joining the buzz have been some of the country's largest tech giants such as Baidu (9888.HK) and Alibaba (9988.HK) who gave updates this week on AI models they have been working on, prompting their shares to zoom.

Baidu said this week it would complete internal testing of its ""Ernie Bot"" in March, a big AI model the search firm has been working on since 2019.

On Wednesday, Alibaba said that its research institute Damo Academy was also testing a ChatGPT-style tool.

Duan, whose company has been using a Baidu AI chatbot named Plato for natural language processing, said ChatGPT was at least a generation more powerful than China's current NLP solutions, though it was weaker in some areas, such as understanding conversation context.

Baidu did not reply to Reuters' request for comments.

Access to OpenAI's GPT-3, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer, was first launched in 2020, an update of which is the backbone of ChatGPT.

Duan said potential long-term compliance risks mean Chinese companies would most likely replace ChatGPT with a local alternative, if they could match the U.S.-developed product's functionality.

""So we actually hope that there can be alternative solutions in China which we can directly use... it may handle Chinese even better, and it can also better comply with regulations,"" he said.

714,554,Microsoft,2023-02-10,"Hanwang, bellwether of Chinese ChatGPT frenzy, under regulatory scrutiny","













SHANGHAI, Feb 10 (Reuters) - The Shenzhen Stock Exchange said on Friday it had put Hanwang Technology Co Ltd (002362.SZ), widely seen as a bellwether of Chinese ChatGPT-concept stocks, on its ""focus watch list"" following recent ""abnormal"" gains in its share price.

The move comes after Chinese state media on Thursday cautioned against risks in chasing local ChatGPT-concept stocks and as Hanwang on Friday flagged earnings risks.

Shares of Hanwang and other Chinese developers of artificial intelligence (AI) products and services have surged as a global frenzy around the Microsoft (MSFT.O)-backed ChatGPT chatbot spurred speculative bets on revolutionary AI computing technology.

ChatGPT, a chatbot developed by U.S. firm OpenAI, gives strikingly human-like responses to user queries.

Hanwang uses natural language processing (NLP) and human-machine interaction technology among others to provide ChatGPT-style products to specific areas such as finance, legal and government administration.

Hanwang's shares slumped nearly 6% on Friday after the company flagged business, trading, and earnings risks at the request of the Shenzhen bourse and disclosed that several major shareholders had reduced their stakes. Still, the stock is up 65% so far this month.

If a stock is put on the exchange's ""focus watch list"", it allows regulators to potentially demand fresh disclosures, impose restrictions on trading, or investigate related securities accounts for suspected misbehaviours if required.

The regulatory scrutiny on Hanwang could further cool the frenzy around the technology that had pumped up shares in Chinese AI companies such as Beijing Haitian Ruisheng Science Technology Ltd (688787.SS) and CloudWalk Technology Co Ltd (688327.SS).

In its exchange filing, Hanwang said its NLP technology is still small and nascent, and faces numerous uncertainties ahead.

In addition, the company expects an annual loss of up to 140 million yuan ($20.57 million) for 2022.

""We advise investors to invest rationally, refrain from speculating, and pay attention to investment risk,"" Hanwang said.

The company also disclosed share sales by its major shareholders this month.

Henan Yellow River Computer System Co Ltd, a top 10 shareholder, sold 2.6 million Hanwang shares between Jan. 30 and Feb. 7, Hanwang said.

Tongfang Investment sold 3.4 million shares during the period, while Juneng Capital Management offloaded 1.2 million shares, the company added.

715,305,Microsoft,2023-02-10,Activist investor ValueAct takes stake in Spotify,"













Feb 10 (Reuters) - ValueAct Capital Management has taken a stake in Spotify Technology SA (SPOT.N), at a time when the audio streaming company is looking to cut costs.

""We welcome ValueAct as an investor in Spotify,"" a spokesperson for the Swedish company said on Friday, without disclosing further details on the investment.

Spotify's shares rose 3.5% to $125.

ValueAct Chief Executive Mason Morfit disclosed the investment during a presentation at a Columbia University event in New York on Friday, according to Bloomberg News, which first reported the stake.

ValueAct, which declined to comment, distinguishes itself from other activist investors by preferring to stay behind the scenes and rarely presents its investment ideas publicly.

It has been investing more frequently in Japan in recent years, but has also made investments in U.S. companies including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Citigroup Inc (C.N).

Meanwhile, Spotify has invested heavily in building up its podcast and audiobooks business in 2022, with operating expenses growing at twice the rate of its revenue.

However, a challenging economic environment set the stage for belt tightening, with Spotify Chief Executive Daniel Ek announcing layoffs and an organizational restructuring in January.

716,651,Microsoft,2023-02-13,"As ChatGPT's popularity explodes, U.S. lawmakers take an interest","













WASHINGTON, Feb 13 (Reuters) - ChatGPT, a fast-growing artificial intelligence program, has drawn praise for its ability to write answers quickly to a wide range of queries, and attracted U.S. lawmakers' attention with questions about its impact on national security and education.

ChatGPT was estimated to have reached 100 million monthly active users just two months after launch, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history, and a growing target for regulation.

It was created by OpenAI, a private company backed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), and made available to the public for free. Its ubiquity has generated fear that generative AI such as ChatGPT could be used to spread disinformation, while educators worry it will be used by students to cheat.

Representative Ted Lieu, a Democrat on the House of Representatives Science Committee, said in a recent opinion piece in the New York Times that he was excited about AI and the ""incredible ways it will continue to advance society,"" but also ""freaked out by A.I., specifically A.I. that is left unchecked and unregulated.""

Lieu introduced a resolution written by ChatGPT that said Congress should focus on AI ""to ensure that the development and deployment of AI is done in a way that is safe, ethical, and respects the rights and privacy of all Americans, and that the benefits of AI are widely distributed and the risks are minimized.""

In January, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman went to Capitol Hill where he met with tech-oriented lawmakers such as Senators Mark Warner, Ron Wyden and Richard Blumenthal and Representative Jake Auchincloss, according to aides to the Democratic lawmakers.

An aide to Wyden said the lawmaker pressed Altman on the need to make sure AI did not include biases that would lead to discrimination in the real world, like housing or jobs.

""While Senator Wyden believes AI has tremendous potential to speed up innovation and research, he is laser-focused on ensuring automated systems don't automate discrimination in the process,"" said Keith Chu, an aide to Wyden.

A second congressional aide described the discussions as focusing on the speed of changes in AI and how it could be used.

Prompted by worries about plagiarism, ChatGPT has already been banned in schools in New York and Seattle, according to media reports. One congressional aide said the concern they were hearing from constituents came mainly from educators focused on cheating.

OpenAI said in a statement: ""We don't want ChatGPT to be used for misleading purposes in schools or anywhere else, so we're already developing mitigations to help anyone identify text generated by that system.""

In an interview with Time, Mira Murati, OpenAI's chief technology officer, said the company welcomed input, including from regulators and governments. ""It's not too early (for regulators to get involved),"" she said.

Andrew Burt, managing partner of BNH.AI, a law firm focused on AI liability, pointed to the national security concerns, adding that he has spoken with lawmakers who are studying whether to regulate ChatGPT and similar AI systems such as Google's Bard, though he said he could not disclose their names.

""The whole value proposition of these types of AI systems is that they can generate content at scales and speeds that humans simply can't,"" he said.

""I would expect malicious actors, non-state actors and state actors that have interests that are adversarial to the United States to be using these systems to generate information that could be wrong or could be harmful.""

ChatGPT itself, when asked how it should be regulated, demurred and said: ""As a neutral AI language model, I don't have a stance on specific laws that may or may not be enacted to regulate AI systems like me."" But it then went on to list potential areas of focus for regulators, such as data privacy, bias and fairness, and transparency in how answers are written.

717,270,Microsoft,2023-02-13,Beijing to support key firms in building ChatGPT-like AI models,"













BEIJING, Feb 13 (Reuters) - China's capital Beijing will support leading enterprises in building large artificial intelligence (AI) models that can challenge ChatGPT, the city's economy and information technology bureau said on Monday.

The city will support key firms to invest in building an open source framework and accelerate the supply of basic data, it said in a statement.

The bureau also said that 1,048 core AI companies, or 29% of the country's total, were located in Beijing as of October last year, and that it would look into ways to cultivate talent and conduct research in areas such as ethical governance.

Microsoft-backed OpenAI's hit chatbot ChatGPT has become the fastest-growing consumer application in history and is rapidly raising awareness in China about how advanced U.S. AI is.

While residents in the country are unable to create OpenAI accounts to access the artificial intelligence-powered (AI) chatbot, firms are rushing to integrate the technology into their products and Chinese tech giants such as Baidu (9888.HK) and Alibaba Group (9988.HK) are gearing up to launch rival services.

Chinese regulators have not commented on ChatGPT so far, though state media has warned about stock market risks amid a frenzy over local ChatGPT-concept stocks.

718,287,Microsoft,2023-02-13,Wall Street ends sharply higher as investors eye inflation data,"Summary

Summary Companies Meta climbs after report of more layoffs

Fidelity National slumps on payments business spinoff

Tech-related heavyweights drive S&P 500 gains

Indexes rally: S&P 500 +1.15%, Nasdaq +1.48%, Dow +1.11%















Feb 13 (Reuters) - Wall Street closed sharply higher on Monday as investors awaited inflation data likely to hint at the path of the Federal Reserve's future interest rate hikes, while Meta Platforms gained after a report that the Facebook parent was planning fresh layoffs.

Meta (META.O) jumped about 3% after the Financial Times reported on Sunday that the company was preparing to announce a new round of job cuts, adding to layoffs last November.

Microsoft (MSFT.O) rose more than 3%, Nvidia (NVDA.O) gained 2.5%, and Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) each rose over 1%. Along with Meta, those tech-related heavyweights contributed more than any other stocks to the S&P 500's gains during a trading session that saw light volume.

Helping lift Microsoft, Stifel raised its price target on the software company and said it is clearly looking to upend Alphabet's Google search dominance through its integration with ChatGPT.

Investors are laser-focused on January inflation data due on Tuesday to reassess their bets on the central bank's monetary policy path.

Wall Street's main indexes lost ground last week after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that interest rates may need to move higher than expected in the central bank's battle against inflation.

""Today is just a natural reaction in the opposite direction after we've seen very heavy selling pressure,"" said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments in Atlanta.

Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes rose, led by information technology (.SPLRCT), up 1.77%, followed by a 1.46% gain in consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD). The energy index (.SPNY) dipped 0.6%.

The S&P 500 climbed 1.15% to end the session at 4,137.32 points.

The Nasdaq gained 1.48% to 11,891.79 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.11% to 34,246.13 points.

However, volume on U.S. exchanges was relatively light, with 9.5 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 11.9 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.

So far in this year, the S&P 500 has gained about 8%, and the index remains down about 14% from its record high close in January 2022.

Fidelity National Information Services Inc (FIS.N) plunged 12.5% following the banking and payments processing conglomerate's decision to spin off its merchant payments business.

Coca-Cola (KO.N) rose 1.6% ahead of its quarterly report due out early on Tuesday.

As U.S. quarterly earnings reports wind down, 69% of the S&P 500 firms that have reported results so far have exceeded profit expectations, according to Refinitiv data. Analysts expect December-quarter earnings to have fallen nearly 3% from a year earlier.

Across the U.S. stock market (.AD.US), advancing stocks outnumbered falling ones by a 2.5-to-one ratio.

The S&P 500 posted four new highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 80 new highs and 59 new lows.

719,355,Microsoft,2023-02-13,Silicon Valley layoffs are a boon for tech-hungry farm equipment makers,"[1/6] Employees at Deere & Co. new tech hub in Chicago’s West Loop neighborhood in the fall last year, Chicago, Illinois, U.S., October 2022 in this handout image. Dave Burk/SOM/Handout via REUTERS















Feb 13 (Reuters) - Big agricultural and construction equipment manufacturers in the American Midwest are on a mission to lure Silicon Valley tech workers who have been caught up in a wave of hiring freezes and layoffs, executives told Reuters.

Mass layoffs at major tech firms have opened the talent pipeline for Illinois-based Deere & Co. (DE.N) - the world's largest tractor maker - and rivals who are eager to add tech workers to their payrolls as they expand into autonomous tractors, mining trucks, and other smart farming technology.

With an abundance of job openings, the companies are offering remote work arrangements and opening new offices in major cities like Austin and Chicago, a potentially attractive draw for workers who don't want to move to smaller Midwestern cities, where many of the companies are based.

The executives said the newly available tech talent could inject much-needed expertise into farm equipment manufacturing, helping to transform the industry through the use of more artificial intelligence and automation.

Detroit automakers are also hiring tech workers to meet the growing software needs of vehicles, auto executives have said.

Historically, it has been difficult for construction and agriculture equipment manufacturers to compete with Silicon Valley compensation packages, Scott Wine, chief executive of CNH Industrial (CNHI.MI), an American-Italian machinery maker, said in an interview.

""They were sucking so much oxygen out of the air because of their significant budgets,"" Wine said. ""Now, they're not hiring and they're firing - so it just means we're getting a much larger pool of potential candidates that we can call upon.""

CNH hired more than 350 engineers last year, some of whom came from Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Wine said. CNH expects to spend more than $1.4 billion in research and development as the company scales precision agriculture offerings in 2023, he added.

The combine harvester producer has increased its focus on agriculture in recent years to meet farmers' equipment demand, stacking its tech workforce with highly skilled workers in automation and artificial intelligence.

Building more cutting-edge machinery, such as a driverless tillage tractor, appealed to 54-year-old Mukesh Agarwal who was recruited by CNH from Microsoft in July 2021, before the latest layoffs.

He now works mostly from his home office in Minnesota and leads a team of software engineers as vice president of precision software and cloud applications development.

""I didn't know much about the ag industry or what CNH did, Agarwal said, admitting that the cultural change was an adjustment during his transition to CNH. ""But, I saw a tremendous opportunity to bring science and innovation together.""

REMOTE-CONTROLLED

Deere's main rival, Irving, Texas-based Caterpillar Inc. (CAT.N), is also making a big push to recruit tech talent. New hires in machine learning, computer science, and software engineering were up 30% in 2022 from the previous year, Karl Weiss, chief technology officer at Caterpillar, said in an interview.

The manufacturer has invested in digital products to improve construction safety using artificial intelligence. It had roughly 500 open tech jobs in December 2022 and it is looking to fill roles with the outflow of laid-off tech workers, Weiss said.

""The layoffs in the tech community have not been lost on us. We're actively talking to those employees,"" he said.

To boost recruiting efforts, Caterpillar exhibited at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) - an annual technology trade show in Las Vegas - in-person for the first time last month. Deere was also there, trying to recruit new talent.

Attendees got to see first-hand how machinery giants are merging heavy metal with technology. In one demonstration, an excavator 1,600 miles (2,580 km) away at one of Caterpillar's Illinois plants was operated by someone using a remote operator station and joysticks.

TECH TALENT PURGE

Thousands of workers have left or been laid off from tech giants Amazon, Microsoft and Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) during the biggest purge of tech talent since the dot-com crash of the late 1990s.

Large tech companies shed more than 150,000 workers in 2022, according to tracking site Layoffs.fyi. During the COVID-19 pandemic, big tech firms hired aggressively to capitalize on advertising dollars as lockdowns prompted a surge in social media use and online purchases.

Layoffs at West Coast-based technology companies have coincided with Deere and CNH boosting investment in artificial intelligence and precision agriculture products, such as automated fertilizer applicators, that they hope to sell to farmers who are trying to boost food production at a time of global shortages.

While the availability of tech workers is plentiful now, industry experts say the hiring window is short for companies to reel in tech workers who also have opportunities at startups.

""Companies really need to jump into action,"" said Michael Solomon, co-founder at 10x Management, a compensation negotiation agency for senior tech talent. ""It's a really great opportunity, but I don't think it's going to last long.""

Working from home was once a rare phenomenon at more traditional companies like Deere, but is now more common. And, in some cases, the companies are willing to let workers stay in their current cities rather than relocating.

The goal is to offer prospective employees the best of both worlds: work from home or come to a city office that more closely resembles a Silicon Valley tech campus.

Deere has its global headquarters in the small city of Moline, about 165 miles west of Chicago, but opening a tech hub in Chicago's trendy West Loop neighborhood last year has helped it be more visible to prospective job candidates who want to live in metro areas.

The new office, which neighbors the corporate location of Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O) in the Windy City, mimics the atmosphere of many startups with unlimited snacks and beer, standing desks, and a gameroom. The amenities aim to attract tech workers.

In an acknowledgement that not all tech workers want to relocate to the Midwest, Deere is also hiring employees in Austin, Texas, where it opened an ""Innovation Hub"" in 2022 and in San Francisco, where it has had an office since 2017, said Johane Domersant, global director of talent at Deere.

Previously, Deere would have required new employees to relocate to the Midwest, likely to Iowa or Moline.

""We are going to go where the talent is and that is a different strategic bent that we wouldn't have done in the past,"" Domersant said.

720,63,Microsoft,2023-02-14,Microsoft to defend Activision deal at EU hearing on Feb. 21,"













BRUSSELS, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) will make a last-ditch effort to defend its $69 billion bid for ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) in front of EU and national antitrust officials at a closed hearing on Feb. 21, the U.S. software company said on Tuesday.

The company asked for the hearing after receiving a statement of objections from the European Commission warning about the possible anti-competitive effects of the deal.

A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed the oral hearing.

The Xbox maker announced the Activision Blizzard acquisition in January last year to help it compete better with leaders Tencent (0700.HK) and Sony (6758.T), but has run into regulatory headwinds in Europe, Britain and the United States.

Microsoft is expected to offer remedies after the hearing.

It has reached a 10-year deal with Nintendo (7974.T) to make ""Call of Duty"" available on Nintendo consoles, a remedy aimed at convincing competition enforcers but which has been criticised by Sony, which wants the deal to be blocked.

721,261,Microsoft,2023-02-14,"Berkshire dumps shares in TSMC, banks; increases Apple stake","













NEW YORK/BANGALORE, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) slashed its stake in Taiwanese contract chipmaker TSMC (2330.TW), as well as in some banks in the fourth quarter, while bolstering its holdings in Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

Berkshire cut its position in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) by 86.2% to 8.29 million sponsored American depositary shares, according to a regulatory filing.

This comes roughly three months after Berkshire unveiled it bought more than $4.1 billion worth of TSMC stock, which sent shares of the world's largest contract chipmaker soaring.

TSMC depository receipts fell 4% in U.S. after hours trade on Tuesday. In Taiwan, TSMC shares opened down 3.3% as Asian markets started Wednesday trading.

Depositary shares in TSMC, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, have surged almost 32% this year, closing at $97.96 on Tuesday.

""Berkshire made a small profit on TSMC. It was not a huge, huge win for Berkshire,"" said Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research analyst. According to her calculations, Berkshire bought it for roughly $68.5 and sold for $74.5.

It is rare but not unprecedented for Berkshire to quickly undo a multi-billion dollar investment in a company's stock. In the first quarter of 2022, Berkshire sold nearly all of what had been an $8.3 billion stake in Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) that it amassed in late 2020.

TSMC last month said revenue in the first quarter is likely to dip 5% as it weathers a global downturn in the chip industry because of softening consumer demand for electronics. TSMC executives have said they do not expect market conditions to improve until the second half of the year.

Besides TSMC, Buffett also divested 91.4% of its shares in US Bancorp (USB.N), to 6.7 million shares, and shrunk its stake in BNY Mellon by roughly 60%, to 25.1 million shares. Both cuts totaled nearly $5.5 billion at current prices.

Buffett's conglomerate also holds shares in Citigroup Inc (C.N), Bank of America (BAC.N) and Jefferies (JEF.N).

Berkshire trimmed some positions across its portfolio of U.S. listed companies, including Chevron (CVX.N), Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O), maker of the ""Call of Duty"" video game, and Kroger (KR.N).

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is making efforts to conclude the acquisition of Activision Blizzard. On Feb. 21, Microsoft will defend the deal in front of European Union and national antitrust officials at a closed hearing.

Among Berkshire's few additions are Apple, which Buffett views more as a consumer products company. Berkshire bought another 20.8 million Apple shares worth $3.2 billion, raising its stake to 5.8%, according to the filing.

Shares in Apple have surged nearly 18% this year.

Berkshire also disclosed a new stake of $84 million in building materials company Louisiana-Pacific Corp (LPX.N).

722,596,Microsoft,2023-02-14,Russian businessman convicted of U.S. hack-and-trade charges,"













BOSTON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - A U.S. jury convicted a wealthy Russian businessman with ties to the Kremlin of charges that he and others made tens of millions of dollars by hacking U.S. computer networks to obtain secret, inside information about multiple companies which they used to make trades.

Vladislav Klyushin, the owner of a Moscow-based information technology company called M-13 that did work for the Russian government, was found guilty on Tuesday by a federal jury in Boston of charges of conspiracy, wire fraud and securities fraud following a trial.

""The jury saw Mr. Klyushin for exactly what he is - a cybercriminal and a cheat,"" U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins in Boston, whose office prosecuted the case, said in a statement.

""We are disappointed but respect the jury's verdict,"" Klyushin's attorney, Maksim Nemtsev, said in an email, adding that his client would appeal.

Of the five Russian nationals charged with carrying out the nearly $90 million scheme, Klyushin, 42, was the only one to be arrested and face trial after he was apprehended in Switzerland during a ski trip in March 2021 and extradited to the United States.

The other four remain at large, including Ivan Ermakov, a former Russian military intelligence officer who worked at M-13 and is wanted by the U.S. government for his alleged involvement in hacking schemes to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and target anti-doping agencies.

Klyushin's trial came a low point in U.S.-Russia relations following Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine last year. While the charges predate the war, Klyushin's connections to the Kremlin have long intrigued U.S. authorities.

His lawyers had argued there was zero evidence he possessed inside information and knew of any hacking, and his attorney in Switzerland said the real reason Klyushin was charged was his Russian government connections.

That lawyer, Oliver Ciric, has said U.S. intelligence officials tried to recruit Klyushin in 2019 and that British intelligence did the same a year later.

Prosecutors said Klyushin and his associates made nearly $90 million trading stocks based on yet-to-be-announced information that hackers stole about hundreds of publicly traded companies.

The hackers broke into the networks of two firms that help publicly traded companies file reports with U.S. securities regulators, Donnelley Financial Solutions (DFIN.N) and Toppan Merrill, prosecutors said.

Hackers from 2018 to 2020 viewed and downloaded yet-to-be-announced earnings reports for hundreds of companies including Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), which Klyushin and others used to trade before the news was public.

The stolen financial information about those companies allowed Klyushin to turned a $2 million investment into nearly $21 million and the group as a whole to turn about $9 million into nearly $90 million, prosecutors said.

Nemtsev at trial argued the prosecution's case was built on ""gaping holes and inferences,"" and that trading was based on news and social media posts that Klyushin's company monitored to forecast stocks.

723,481,Microsoft,2023-02-14,Exclusive: EU's Breton plans consultation on Big Tech and telecoms network costs,"













STRASBOURG, Feb 14 (Reuters) - EU industry chief Thierry Breton is poised to launch a consultation on whether Big Tech should bear some telecoms network costs, he said on Tuesday ahead of a telecoms conference taking place in Barcelona from Feb. 27 to March 2.

EU telecoms providers including Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), Orange (ORAN.PA), Telefonica (TEF.MC) and Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) have for years sought to have Big Tech foot some infrastructure cost for 5G and broadband.

The telecoms companies say the six largest content providers - Meta (META.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O) - account for more than half of data internet traffic.

The tech giants say the idea amounts to an internet traffic tax that could undermine Europe's net neutrality rules to ensure all users are treated equally.

Asked when the consultation would be launched, Breton told Reuters: ""Wait for my speech at Barcelona. Yes, I will announce it soon. At Barcelona.""

The consultation is likely to take about 12 weeks before the European Commission will propose legislation that will need to be thrashed out by EU countries and EU lawmakers before it can become law.

Breton said he was confident the process could be wrapped up by the end of the year. ""We will have time, yes,"" he said.

Announcing the start of the consultation at Barcelona is a strong signal to the telecoms sector of Breton's backing, a telecoms industry source said. It would be Breton's first appearance at an event traditionally attended by all major telecoms operators.

724,469,Microsoft,2023-02-14,Retail investor risk appetite improves with AI stocks leading,"[1/2] A trader works on the trading floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., January 27, 2023. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly















NEW YORK, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Some of Wall Street's most speculative names, including meme stocks and shares of artificial intelligence companies, are leading the equity market rally this year, helped by renewed interest from retail investors.

Retail investors had a poor year in 2022, with the average portfolio ending the year down around 35% from all-time highs, Vanda Research previously estimated.

However, retail investors have shown renewed interest in the early part of 2023. Aggregate inflows into the U.S. stock market, though concentrated in a few names, has reached levels last seen in 2020-21, according to Vanda Research.

Shares of companies linked to artificial intelligence have soared after U.S. firm OpenAI, the owner of ChatGPT, a chatbot that gives strikingly human-like responses to user queries, snagged a multi-billion dollar investment from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

Meme stocks have clawed back some of last year's losses, while shares of larger, tech-focused companies such as Nvidia and Tesla have also joined in the fray.

The Nasdaq Composite Index (.IXIC), home of many smaller, more speculative companies as well as the megacaps, is up 13% this year, after a 33% loss in 2022. The S&P 500 index is up about 7%.

""We've definitely seen risk appetites return to equity markets this year,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.

AI and meme stocks have rallied this year

AI BOOM

Companies building artificial intelligence tools have been among the rally's biggest winners, a move market observers say has been driven in part by retail investors.

Big gainers include shares in analytics firm BigBear.ai , which are up 500% this year, and chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA.O), up 50%. Meanwhile, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) jostle to pull ahead in the race for the next big growth driver.

Five of the largest Artificial Intelligence ETFs, which offer exposure to firms involved in the development and production of robots or artificial intelligence, have grown assets to $4.27 billion, up 18% this year, compared with a 10% rise in assets for the Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ ETF .

Meanwhile, shares of early meme stocks GameStop (GME.N) and AMC Entertainment (AMC.N) have pared some losses after last year's tumble.

Not all meme stocks are thriving, however: shares of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY.O), which soared as much as 180% in early February, have retreated to trade down 19% for the year as investors await details on whether the struggling retailer can avoid bankruptcy.

U.S. financial conditions are much tighter than they were when meme stocks mounted their initial rally in 2021

CONDITIONS TIGHT

Many market participants are quick to draw contrasts between the current rally in speculative names and meme stocks' initial surge in 2021.

One key comparison is bond yields, which now offer increased competition to stocks after hitting multi-year highs in 2022 as the Fed tightened monetary policy. Investors have recently recalibrated how high the Fed might raise rates this year amid signs of a stronger-than-expected job market.

""The current state of play is undoubtedly more challenging,"" analysts at Vanda Research said in a note on Thursday.

The Fed's rate-hiking campaign has tightened financial conditions relative to two years ago, with the Chicago Fed's U.S. National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) at -0.36, compared to -0.62 in 2021, signaling tighter financial conditions.

OPTIONS ACTION

The return to risk-taking is showing up in record trading volumes in the U.S. options market.

Demand for calls, which convey the right to buy stock at a fixed price in the future, has outstripped puts, typically used for bearish wagers, with 1.15 calls traded for every put over the last month, per Trade Alert data.

Still, that measure is not as euphoric as in 2021, when it reached a high of two calls traded for every put.

SHORTS TAKE AIM

While retail traders may be rushing in, short sellers - who aim to profit by selling borrowed shares and hoping to buy them back later at a lower price - have been adding to their bets, particularly in the AI space.

""Investor enthusiasm is also attracting short-sellers that are skeptical about some of the resulting valuations,"" said Evan Niu, an analyst at Ortex, which tracks real-time short interest data.

Short interest for C3.ai stands near an 8-month high of 19%. AI software firm Veritone (VERI.O), SoundHound and BigBear.ai also show a pick up in short interest, Ortex data showed.

At the same time, short sellers are digging in their heels on their bets against Bed Bath & Beyond, with short interest at a near 6-month high of 48.6%, per Ortex data.

725,375,Microsoft,2023-02-14,"From state media to a Shaolin temple, Baidu's ChatGPT-style bot sees partner rush","













BEIJING, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Chinese organisations, from state media to a Shaolin temple, said on Tuesday they have signed partnerships with Baidu's ChatGPT-style project, ahead of an expected launch next month.

The Chinese search engine giant (9888.HK) last week announced that it would complete internal testing of its “Ernie Bot"" in March. It is a large artificial intelligence (AI) powered language model that seeks to rival Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s hit chatbot.

China's Shaolin Temple, the cradle of Chinese kung fu, said in a statement it would work with Baidu to integrate Ernie into its operations with the purpose of creating an AI-driven content environment.

Over a dozen Chinese media outlets also said they had entered tie-ups with Baidu, including the state-owned Shanghai Securities Journal. The journal said that it would use the chatbot to increase its competitiveness and lead an ""upgrade"" in the financial media industry.

Baidu's banking joint venture with CITIC (601998.SS), as well as its electric vehicle arm Jidu Auto, also said on Tuesday they would integrate Ernie into their operations.

A Baidu spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The stream of announcements highlights the growing enthusiasm for generative AI in China, after ChatGPT became the fastest-growing consumer application in history, raising awareness in China about how advanced the U.S.’ AI efforts are.

Many other Chinese tech companies, big and small, have said they are working on their own ChatGPT products, including Alibaba Group (9988.HK) and JD.com (9618.HK).

726,130,Microsoft,2023-02-15,Credo slumps as top customer of data center cable maker cuts orders,"













Feb 15 (Reuters) - Credo Technology Group Holding's (CRDO.O) shares nearly halved in value on Wednesday after the supplier of electric cables to data centers said its biggest client had cut orders, and forecast quarterly revenue well below Street expectations.

The company did not name the client, but analysts with at least four brokerages said the customer could be Microsoft (MSFT.O), which has cut costs partly due to slowing demand for cloud services.

Credo had its worst day since going public in January last year and the losses erased more than $1 billion from its $2.84 billion market valuation, putting a spotlight on the fallout of spending cuts by Big Tech firms.

Latest earnings from tech giants showed the pandemic-led cloud boom was easing as businesses cut costs due to high inflation, though Microsoft said it expects its third-quarter cloud infrastructure spending to be higher than the previous quarter.

Credo's forecast was concerning, Mizuho analysts said as Microsoft Azure's cloud business has been more resilient than rivals Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) Web Services and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google Cloud.

Credo in its second quarter ended Oct. 29 had garnered 44% of its revenue from its biggest client, according to a regulatory filing. Reuters could not immediately verify if Microsoft was Credo's largest customer.

while Microsoft was not available for comment.

""What likely happened is that their biggest customer Microsoft probably had a significant reduction in its (order)forecast for Credo,"" Needham analyst Quinn Bolton said.

""Credo in response is thinking 'hey if Microsoft is starting to correct orders may be we need to be more conservative in our outlook'.""

Bolton said the customer ordered AECs - a copper plug-and-play cable used to handle high computing speeds in datacenters - at a greater rate than it deployed over the past several quarters due to prior supply chain constraints and the COVID shutdowns in Kunshan, China last year.

At least five brokerages cut their price target on Credo's stock. Cowen and Co slashed it the most by $7 to $11 and downgraded to ""market perform"" from ""outperform"".

Credo said late on Tuesday its dour projections were also due to macroeconomic challenges and it was managing its operating expenses to boost profitability.

The company said it expected fourth-quarter revenue of $30 million to $32 million, below Refinitiv estimates of $58.3 million. It is yet to report its third-quarter results.

Credo, which also designs chips, currently outsources all its semiconductor manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (2330.TW).

727,157,Microsoft,2023-02-15,U.S. House Judiciary subpoenas Big Tech CEOs over free speech,"[1/3] U.S. House Oversight and Accountability Committee member Representative Jim Jordan (R-OH). Jordan is a leading member of the House Freedom Caucus. February 8, 2023. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein/File Photo/File Photo















WASHINGTON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - U.S. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan on Wednesday subpoenaed the chief executives of Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms (META.O), and Microsoft (MSFT.O) for documents and communications relating to free-speech issues.

Jordan and other conservatives accused the companies of suppressing conservative speech during the Trump administration, and expanded that accusation to include colluding with the Biden administration once he won the White House. The White House and major tech companies have rejected the allegation.

""These subpoenas are the first step in holding Big Tech accountable,"" Jordan's office said in a statement.

Microsoft and Meta said that they had already begun producing documents. Microsoft said it was ""engaged with the Committee, and committed to working in good faith."" None of the other three companies responded to a request for comment.

The subpoenas, sent to Alphabet's Sundar Pichai, Andy Jassy of Amazon.com, Tim Cook of Apple, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, and Satya Nadella of Microsoft, demand documents and communications related to alleged collusion between the government and the companies to stifle free speech.

Jordan set a March 23 deadline to turn over documents.

Republicans who took control of the House of Representatives in January after narrowly winning control in the November elections have made questions about Big Tech a top focus and created a Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government.

Last week, the panel held its first hearing into Republican claims that the Justice Department and FBI show anti-conservative bias, a move made following the FBI's discovery of hundreds of classified documents at Republican former President Donald Trump's Florida resort.

Jordan wrote related letters to the companies in December, making similar demands to big tech but this was when the House was in Democratic hands and before he became chair. Jordan's office said that the companies did not adequately comply.

728,134,Microsoft,2023-02-17,Exclusive: Microsoft's Bing plans AI ads in early pitch to advertisers,"













Feb 17 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) has started discussing with ad agencies how it plans to make money from its revamped Bing search engine powered by generative artificial intelligence as the tech company seeks to battle Google's dominance.

In a meeting with a major ad agency this week, Microsoft showed off a demo of the new Bing and said it plans to allow paid links within responses to search results, said an ad executive, who spoke about the private meeting on the condition of anonymity.

Generative AI, which can produce original answers in a human voice in response to open-ended questions or requests, has recently captivated the world. Last week, Microsoft and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google announced new generative AI chatbots a day apart from the other. Those bots, which have not yet rolled out widely to users, will be able to synthesize material on the web for complex search queries.

Early search results and conversations with Microsoft's Bing and Google's chatbot called Bard have shown they can be unpredictable. Alphabet lost $100 billion in market value on the day when it released a promotional video for Bard that showed the chatbot sharing inaccurate information.

Microsoft expects the more human responses from the Bing AI chatbot will generate more users for its search function and therefore more advertisers. Advertisements within the Bing chatbot may also enjoy more prominence on the page compared to traditional search ads.

Microsoft is already testing ads in its early version of the Bing chatbot, which is available to a limited number of users, according to the ad executive and ads seen by Reuters this week.

The company said it is taking traditional search ads, in which brands pay to have their websites or products appear on search results for keywords related to their business, and inserting them into responses generated by the Bing chatbot, the ad executive said.

Microsoft declined to comment on the specifics of its plans.

Microsoft is also planning another ad format within the chatbot that will be geared toward advertisers in specific industries. For example, when a user asks the new AI-powered Bing ""what are the best hotels in Mexico?"", hotel ads could pop up, according to the ad executive.

Integrating ads into the Bing chatbot, which can be expanded to fill the top of the search page, could help ensure that ads are not pushed further down the page below the chatbot.

Omnicom, a major ad group that works with brands like AT&T and Unilever, has told clients that search ads could generate lower revenue in the short term if the chatbots take up the top of search pages without including any ads, according to a note to clients last week, which was reviewed by Reuters.

The new Bing, which has a waitlist of millions of people for access, is a potentially lucrative opportunity for Microsoft. The company said during an investor and press presentation last week that every percentage point of market share it gains in the search advertising market could bring in another $2 billion of ad revenue.

Microsoft's Edge web browser, which uses the Bing search engine, has a market share under 5% worldwide, according to one estimate from web analytics firm StatCounter.

Michael Cohen, executive vice president of performance media at media agency Horizon Media, who received a demo of Bing during a separate meeting with Microsoft representatives, said the company indicated that links at the bottom of Bing's AI-generated search responses could be places for ads.

""They seem intent on starting off immediately with paid ads integrated,"" Cohen said, adding that Microsoft said more information about the strategy could come in early March.

This week, when a Reuters reporter asked the new version of Bing outfitted with AI for the price of car air filters, Bing included advertisements for filters sold by auto parts website Parts Geek.

Parts Geek did not immediately respond to questions about whether it was aware of its ads appearing in the new Bing chatbot.

Microsoft, when asked about the Parts Geek ads, said the potential of the new AI technology in advertising is only beginning to be explored and it aims to work with its partners and the ad industry.

Despite the early tests, Microsoft has not provided a timeline for when brands will be able to directly purchase ads within the chatbot, Cohen and the ad executive said.

In the long term, conversational AI is likely to become the dominant way consumers search on the internet, Omnicom said in its letter to clients.

""It is not an exaggeration to say that (Microsoft and Google's) announcements signal the biggest change to search in 20 years,"" Omnicom said.

729,90,Microsoft,2023-02-17,Microsoft-backed OpenAI to let users customize ChatGPT,"













SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 16 (Reuters) - OpenAI, the startup behind ChatGPT, on Thursday said it is developing an upgrade to its viral chatbot that users can customize, as it works to address concerns about bias in artificial intelligence.

The San Francisco-based startup, which Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has funded and used to power its latest technology, said it has worked to mitigate political and other biases but also wanted to accommodate more diverse views.

“This will mean allowing system outputs that other people (ourselves included) may strongly disagree with,” it said in a blog post, offering customization as a way forward. Still, there will “always be some bounds on system behavior.”

ChatGPT, released in November last year, has sparked frenzied interest in the technology behind it called generative AI, which is used to produce answers mimicking human speech that have dazzled people.

The news from the startup comes the same week that some media outlets have pointed out that answers from Microsoft’s new Bing search engine, powered by OpenAI, are potentially dangerous and that the technology may not be ready for prime time.

How technology companies set guardrails for this nascent technology is a key focus area for companies in the generative AI space with which they’re still wrestling. Microsoft said Wednesday that user feedback was helping it improve Bing before a wider rollout, learning for instance that its AI chatbot can be “provoked” to give responses it did not intend.

OpenAI said in the blog post that ChatGPT’s answers are first trained on large text datasets available on the Internet. As a second step, humans review a smaller dataset, and are given guidelines for what to do in different situations.

For example, in the case that a user requests content that is adult, violent, or contains hate speech, the human reviewer should direct ChatGPT to answer with something like “I can’t answer that.”

If asked about a controversial topic, the reviewers should allow ChatGPT to answer the question, but offer to describe viewpoints of people and movements, instead of trying to “take the correct viewpoint on these complex topics,” the company explained in an excerpt of its guidelines for the software.

730,592,Microsoft,2023-02-17,Tech giants from Google to TikTok face tougher EU rules,"













BRUSSELS, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Tech giants including Facebook, Google, Twitter and TikTok face stricter online content rules in the European Union due to their huge number of users.

The new rules, known as the Digital Services Act (DSA), classify companies with more than 45 million users as very large online platforms (VLOPs) and require them to do risk management and external and independent auditing.

They will also have to share data with authorities and researchers and adopt a code of conduct.

The European Commission had given online platforms and search engines until Feb. 17 to publish their monthly active users. Those labelled as VLOPs have four months to comply with the rules or risk fines.

Twitter on Thursday said it had 100.9 million average monthly users in the EU, based on an estimation of the last 45 days.

Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) provided one set of numbers based on users' accounts and another set based on signed-out recipients, saying users can access its services whether they sign in to an account or are signed out.

It said the average monthly number of signed-in users totalled 278.6 million at Google Maps, 274.6 million at Google Play, 332 million at Google Search, 74.9 million at Shopping and 401.7 million at YouTube.

Apple (AAPL.O) said only its App Store built for its iPhones, with more than 45 million monthly users, qualified as a very large online platform. But it will also apply the same rules to the App Store for iPads, Mac computers, Apple Watch and TV, and to its Apple Books e-books and podcasts paid subscriptions.

""Apple intends, on an entirely voluntary basis, to align each of the existing versions of the App Store (including those that do not currently meet the VLOP designation threshold) with the existing DSA requirements for VLOPs,"" it said on its site.

Amazon (AMZN.O) said it had more than 45 million users in the EU, while Microsoft (MSFT.O) said its Bing search engine had 107 million average monthly users in the last six months of 2022.

Alibaba Group Holding's (9988.HK) e-commerce site AliExpress said its average monthly active users in the EU was above 45 million from Aug. 1 last year to Jan. 31 this year.

TikTok has 100.9 million average monthly users in the EU based on an estimation of the last 45 days.

Ebay (EBAY.O) said it was below the EU user threshold.

Meta Platforms (META.O) has said it had 255 million average monthly active users on Facebook in the EU and about 250 million average monthly active users on Instagram in the last six months of 2022. Companies will have to report user numbers every six months.

731,509,Microsoft,2023-02-17,"Salesforce, activist investor Elliott in talks to end board challenge","













Feb 17 (Reuters) - Cloud-based software firm Salesforce Inc (CRM.N) and activist investor Elliott Management Corp are in discussions to reach an agreement that may end a possible board challenge, according to two people familiar with the matter.

The battle at Salesforce has pitted Elliott as well as other activist investors against Marc Benioff, one of Silicon Valley's most iconic chief executives. Salesforce's growth has slowed dramatically in recent quarters and last month the company said it would cut 10% of jobs to address its performance.

Activists, which also include Jeff Ubben's Inclusive Capital Partners and Jeff Smith's Starboard Value, have been pushing for Salesforce to increase growth and margins, buy back more shares, and raised concerns about recent acquisitions.

Elliott, which unveiled its stake in January and has been engaging with the company for about a month, had searched for director candidates laying the groundwork for a potential challenge.

A settlement could potentially bring the two sides together, the sources said. But there is no indication on when an agreement might be reached or what it might look like.

Representatives for Salesforce and Elliott declined to comment.

Shares of the stock were down 2.4% in trading on Friday; Salesforce has lost more than 20% of its value in the last 52 weeks, trailing the S&P 500.

The news of talks was first reported by CNBC.

Earlier this year, Salesforce, which is valued at $168 billion, said it planned to cut a tenth of jobs and close some offices after rapid pandemic hiring left it with a bloated workforce.

The company also refreshed its board, adding the principal of hedge fund ValueAct.

ValueAct Capital's Mason Morfit will be joined by Mastercard (MA.N) finance chief Sachin Mehra and former chief executive of Carnival Corp (CCL.N) Arnold Donald on the board.

ValueAct has experience with companies like Salesforce after Morfit served on the board of Microsoft, where the board set cloud targets for management and tied them to a compensation plan. ValueAct also had a board seat at Adobe.

Elliott too has long invested in technology companies and in the past reached settlements for board seats with companies including Pinterest (PINS.N), Twitter and eBay (EBAY.O).

HONG KONG, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) is abandoning plans to venture into virtual reality hardware, as a sobering economic outlook prompts the Chinese tech giant to cut costs and headcount at its metaverse unit, three sources familiar with the matter said.

The world's largest video game publisher had ambitious plans to build both virtual reality software and hardware at an ""extended reality"" XR unit it launched in June last year, for which it hired nearly 300 people.

It had come up with a concept for a ring-like hand-held game controller, but difficulties in achieving quick profitability and the large investment needed to produce a competitive product were among factors that prompted a shift away from that strategy, two of the sources said.

One of the sources said the XR project was not expected to become profitable until 2027, according to an internal forecast. The second source said the unit also had a lack of promising games and non-gaming applications.

The sources declined to be named as the information is confidential.

""Under the company's new strategy as a whole, it no longer quite fit in,"" the first source said.

Earlier in the year, Tencent had also planned to buy gaming phone maker Black Shark, which it believed had supply chain and inventory experience that could beef up its hardware push and add 1,000 people to the unit.

However, it eventually walked away from that deal due to Tencent's shift in strategy, as well as mounting regulatory scrutiny and an expected lengthy review process, one of the sources who had direct knowledge of the matter said.

The sources said that Tencent had advised most of the unit's staff to seek other opportunities, confirming a Thursday report from Chinese tech news outlet 36Kr.

Tencent declined to comment on the Black Shark deal and whether Beijing's scrutiny had soured the deal. Regarding the status of the XR unit, the company referred to a statement to Reuters on Thursday that said it was making adjustments to some business teams as development plans for hardware had changed.

The company also said on Thursday that it was not disbanding the XR unit.

Tencent shares slipped as much as 2.5% after Reuters' report.

METAVERSE INTEREST

The launch of the XR unit came amid swelling global interest in the metaverse concept of virtual worlds and had marked a rare foray into hardware for Tencent, which is mostly known for software that includes a suite of games and social media applications.

It also entered into a race against Western peers such as Meta Platforms (META.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), which are building their own metaverses and have their own virtual reality hardware projects.

One of the sources said that Tencent had dabbled in virtual reality about seven years ago for a short while, and its interest in the area had been revived in 2021 after learning of new breakthroughs in pancake lenses and more powerful displays. Strong sales of Meta's Quest headset was also a driver, the person added.

But last year marked one of the toughest years for Tencent since its founding in 1998, with revenue battered by a regulatory crackdown and headwinds from measures to stop the spread of COVID-19.

Underlining such strains, its founder Pony Ma in December displayed a rare show of frustration at a year-end meeting when he lambasted senior managers for not working hard enough and said the company needed to focus on short video for future growth.

Several tech companies include Meta and Google have announced layoffs as they seek to trim costs amid rising fears of a global recession.

Pico, a virtual reality (VR) headset manufacturer owned by TikTok's Chinese developer ByteDance, said on Friday it was laying off a small number of people, after local media reported the start of hundreds of redundancies earlier this week. A source familiar with the matter said 200 staff were affected.

Indexes: S&P 500 -0.28%, Nasdaq -0.58%, Dow +0.39%















Feb 17 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended lower on Friday, weighed down by Microsoft and Nvidia as investors worried that inflation and a strong U.S. economy could put the Federal Reserve on pace for more interest rate hikes.

The see-saw session on Wall Street followed economic data this week that pointed to elevated inflation, a tight job market and resilience in consumer spending, giving the Fed more room for to raise borrowing costs.

Goldman Sachs and Bank of America forecast three more rate hikes this year and by a quarter of a percentage point each, up from their previous estimate of two rate rises.

Traders are expecting at least two more rate increases and see the Fed rate peaking at 5.3% by July as central bank attempts to cool the economy and reduce inflation.

""A dark cloud has drifted over the stock market in the last two weeks based on a higher watermark for the Fed funds rate,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

""The jobs numbers aren't getting weaker, and it's hard to go into a recession with a strong labor market at the same time. That means the Fed could push the button and move rates higher,"" Dollarhide said.

S&P 500 trading

Microsoft Corp <MFST.O> fell 1.6% and Nvidia (NVDA.O) dipped 2.8%, both weighing on the S&P 500 as the yield on 10-year Treasury notes hit a three-month high.

The CBOE Volatility index (.VIX), also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, traded above 20 points for a second session in a row.

Of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes, six rose, led by consumer staples (.SPLRCS), up 1.29%, followed by a 1% gain in Utilities (.SPLRCU). Energy dropped 3.65%, with Exxon Mobil losing 3.8%.

The S&P 500 declined 0.28% to end the session at 4,079.09 points.

The Nasdaq fell 0.58% to 11,787.27 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.39% to 33,826.69 points.

For the week, the S&P 500 fell 0.3%, the Dow lost 0.1% and the Nasdaq climbed 0.6%.

The S&P 500 has gained about 6% so far in 2023, while the Nasdaq has rebounded about 13% following deep losses last year.

Adding to recent worries about monetary policy, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said the central bank will need to keep raising interest rates until it makes much more progress tackling inflation. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said the central bank still needs to raise interest rates, but that it could stick with quarter-point increases.

Moderna Inc <MRNA.O> fell 3.3% after its experimental messenger RNA-based influenza vaccine delivered mixed results in a study.

Deere & Co (DE.N) surged 7.5% after the world's largest farm equipment maker raised its annual profit and beat quarterly earnings expectations.

Lithium miners Livent Corp (LTHM.N), Albemarle Corp (ALB.N) and Piedmont Lithium Inc (PLL.O) slumped between 10% and 12% due to concerns about weakness in Chinese prices for the EV battery metal.

The most traded company in the S&P 500 was Tesla Inc , with $42.9 billion worth of shares exchanged during the session. The shares rose 3.10%.

U.S. stock markets will be closed on Monday on account of Presidents' Day.

Advancing issues outnumbered falling ones within the S&P 500 (.AD.SPX) by a 1.1-to-one ratio.

The S&P 500 posted eight new highs and one new low; the Nasdaq recorded 75 new highs and 68 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was relatively light, with 10.6 billion shares traded, compared with an average of 11.7 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.

734,773,Microsoft,2023-02-21,Wall Street posts worst day of 2023 on higher-for-longer rate fears,"Summary

Summary Companies Biggest daily falls on Wall St since Dec. 15

Home Depot falls as FY profit forecast disappoints

Big tech stocks hit in widespread decline

U.S. business activity expands for first time in 8 months

Indexes down: Dow 2.06%, S&P 2%, Nasdaq 2.5%















Feb 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street posted its worst performance of the year on Tuesday, with the main benchmarks ending down as investors interpreted a rebound in U.S. business activity in February to mean interest rates will need to stay higher for longer to control inflation.

For the S&P 500 (.SPX) and Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC), it was their third session in a row closing lower, while the decline in the Dow Jones Industrial (.DJI) wiped out its gains for 2023.

The falls came after the S&P Global Purchasing Manufacturer's index, which reflects business activity in the United States, returned to expansion for the first time in eight months in February. The 50.2 reading, up from 46.8 in January, was buoyed by a robust services sector, according to a survey.

The report added to a recent slew of economic data which has painted a picture of a resilient economy, which continues to perform against a backdrop of multiple rate-rises by the central bank in 2022 aimed at tamping down inflation.

With inflation still far from the Fed's 2% target, and the economy retaining much of its vigor, money market participants have been revising upwards where they see the Fed fund rates peaking - currently at 5.35% in July and staying near those levels throughout the year.

""Today, the realization is that the Fed is not kidding around about higher for longer, and in fact it might be a little bit higher for a little-to-a-lot bit longer,"" said Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office.

U.S. stocks had an upbeat start to the year after their worst annual showing in more than a decade in 2022, as investors hoped the central bank's rate-hike cycle was nearing its end. Such positivity makes equity markets susceptible to pull-backs though, when data undermines such expectations.

""The market keeps looking for a dovish pivot, and they are just not going to get it,"" said Schleif.

Investors will look to the minutes detailing discussion at the Fed's last policy meeting, due out on Wednesday, for further clues on attitudes within the central bank on rates.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 697.1 points, or 2.06%, to 33,129.59, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 81.75 points, or 2.00%, to 3,997.34 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 294.97 points, or 2.5%, to 11,492.30.

Among those hit by Tuesday's widespread declines were big tech stocks, with Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) all falling between 2.1% and 5.3%.

Not helping them was the fact the U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury notes hit a fresh three-month high.

Higher yields typically weigh on growth stocks, whose valuations tend to be based on future profits that are discounted heavily as rates go higher.

The semiconductor index (.SOX) was also impacted, dropping 3.3%.

Elsewhere, Home Depot Inc (HD.N) slumped 7.1% to a three-month low after the No. 1 domestic home improvement chain warned of weakening demand and issued a dour profit forecast for 2023.

Smaller rival Lowe's Cos Inc (LOW.N) fell 5.1% ahead of its results next week.

Walmart (WMT.N) forecast full-year earnings below estimates and painted a grim picture of hotter-than-expected food inflation squeezing profit margins. However, the world's largest retailer rose 0.6%.

All of the major 11 S&P 500 sectors fell, with the consumer discretionary index's (.SPLRCD) 3.3% decline leading the way.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11 billion shares, compared with the 11.62 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

The S&P 500 posted two new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 57 new highs and 112 new lows.

735,655,Microsoft,2023-02-21,Four-day week liked by UK employers in world's largest trial,"Summary

Summary Companies Nine out of 10 firms in trial stick to four-day week

Companies say employees work more in less time

Four-day week gains appeal, but some companies still reticent















LONDON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Dozens of British employers trialling a four-day working week have mostly decided to stick with it after a pilot hailed as a breakthrough by campaigners for better work-life balance.

Employees at 61 companies across Britain worked an average of 34 hours across four days between June and December 2022, while earning their existing salary. Of those, 56 companies, or 92%, opted to continue like that, 18 of them permanently.

The trial is the largest in the world, according to Autonomy, a British-based research organisation which published the report alongside a group of academics and with backing from New Zealand-based group 4 Day Week Global.

While the findings may be interesting for companies struggling for talent, other surveys show very few other British employers plan a four-day week soon.

The Autonomy trial covered 2,900 staff in total across different sectors, ranging from finance company Stellar Asset Management to digital manufacturer Rivelin Robotics and a fish-and-chip shop in the coastal town of Wells-next-the-sea.

The majority agreed productivity had been maintained.

Staff said their well-being and work-life balance had improved while data showed employees were much less likely to quit their jobs as a result of the four-day week policy.

""This is a major breakthrough moment for the movement towards a four-day working week,"" Joe Ryle, Director of the 4 Day Week Campaign, said in a statement.

'MORE WORK DONE IN LESS TIME'

Paul Oliver, chief operating officer at Citizens Advice Gateshead, said job retention and recruitment had improved and sickness levels had gone down during the trial.

""Staff are getting more work done in less time,"" he said.

For some employees, the extra day off was more important than pay: 15% said no amount of money would induce them back to a five-day week. Some staff had Wednesdays off, while others had a three-day weekend policy.

Employers from the marketing and advertising, professional services and charity sectors were most represented in the trial. Some 66% of those participating had 25 or fewer employees, while 22% had 50 or more staff. 11% were not for profit.

The trial reflects growing scrutiny of how people work, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic when furlough schemes and mandatory work-from-home periods prompted many to question whether they needed to sit in an office five days a week.

In recent years, some larger global corporates have trialled a four-day approach and also reported successful outcomes. Microsoft (MSFT.O) piloted it in Japan for a month in 2019 while consumer goods giant Unilever (ULVR.L) carried out a year-long trial in New Zealand in 2020.

However, corporate Britain as a whole does not appear keen.

When the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), representing human resources professionals, surveyed members last year, it found very few employers expect to move to a four-day week in the next three years.

Two thirds expected no change in the next decade.

However, evidence that it helped to retain staff could prove powerful for companies struggling to recruit workers since the pandemic. Britain has the added complication of its departure from the European Union.

""That should give us a competitive advantage,"" a senior manager at an insurance firm in the trial said of the evidence of worker retention from a four-day week.

736,612,Microsoft,2023-02-21,ChatGPT launches boom in AI-written e-books on Amazon,"













SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Until recently, Brett Schickler never imagined he could be a published author, though he had dreamed about it. But after learning about the ChatGPT artificial intelligence program, Schickler figured an opportunity had landed in his lap.

""The idea of writing a book finally seemed possible,"" said Schickler, a salesman in Rochester, New York. ""I thought 'I can do this.'""

Using the AI software, which can generate blocks of text from simple prompts, Schickler created a 30-page illustrated children’s e-book in a matter of hours, offering it for sale in January through Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) self-publishing unit.

In the edition, Sammy the Squirrel, crudely rendered also using AI, learns from his forest friends about saving money after happening upon a gold coin. He crafts an acorn-shaped piggy bank, invests in an acorn trading business and hopes to one day buy an acorn grinding stone.

Sammy becomes the wealthiest squirrel in the forest, the envy of his friends and ""the forest started prospering,"" according to the book.

""The Wise Little Squirrel: A Tale of Saving and Investing,"" available in the Amazon Kindle store for $2.99 - or $9.99 for a printed version - has netted Schickler less than $100, he said. While that may not sound like much, it is enough to inspire him to compose other books using the software.

""I could see people making a whole career out of this,"" said Schickler, who used prompts on ChatGPT like ""write a story about a dad teaching his son about financial literacy.""

Schickler is on the leading edge of a movement testing the promise and limitations of ChatGPT, which debuted in November and has sent shock waves through Silicon Valley and beyond for its uncanny ability to create cogent blocks of text instantly.

There were over 200 e-books in Amazon’s Kindle store as of mid-February listing ChatGPT as an author or co-author, including ""How to Write and Create Content Using ChatGPT,"" ""The Power of Homework"" and poetry collection ""Echoes of the Universe."" And the number is rising daily. There is even a new sub-genre on Amazon: Books about using ChatGPT, written entirely by ChatGPT.

But due to the nature of ChatGPT and many authors' failure to disclose they have used it, it is nearly impossible to get a full accounting of how many e-books may be written by AI.

The software's emergence has already ruffled some of the biggest technology firms, prompting Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to hastily debut new functions in Google and Bing, respectively, that incorporate AI.

The rapid consumer adoption of ChatGPT has spurred frenzied activity in tech circles as investors pour money into AI-focused startups and given technology firms new purpose amid the gloom of massive layoffs. Microsoft, for one, received fawning coverage this month over its otherwise moribund Bing search engine after demonstrating an integration with ChatGPT.

But already there are concerns over authenticity, because ChatGPT learns how to write by scanning millions of pages of existing text. An experiment with AI by CNET resulted in multiple corrections and apparent plagiarism before the tech news site suspended its use.

THREAT TO 'REAL' AUTHORS?

Now ChatGPT appears ready to upend the staid book industry as would-be novelists and self-help gurus looking to make a quick buck are turning to the software to help create bot-made e-books and publish them through Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing arm. Illustrated children’s books are a favorite for such first-time authors. On YouTube, TikTok and Reddit hundreds of tutorials have spring up, demonstrating how to make a book in just a few hours. Subjects include get-rich-quick schemes, dieting advice, software coding tips and recipes.

“This is something we really need to be worried about, these books will flood the market and a lot of authors are going to be out of work,” said Mary Rasenberger, executive director of writers’ group the Authors Guild. Ghostwriting - by humans - has a long tradition, she said, but the ability to automate through AI could turn book writing from a craft into a commodity.

“There needs to be transparency from the authors and the platforms about how these books are created or you’re going to end up with a lot of low-quality books,” she said.

One author, who goes by Frank White, showed in a YouTube video how in less than a day he created a 119-page novella called “Galactic Pimp: Vol. 1” about alien factions in a far-off galaxy warring over a human-staffed brothel. The book can be had for just $1 on Amazon’s Kindle e-book store. In the video, White says anyone with the wherewithal and time could create 300 such books a year, all using AI.

Many authors, like White, feel no duty to disclose in the Kindle store that their great American novel was written wholesale by a computer, in part because Amazon’s policies do not require it.

When asked for comment by Reuters, Amazon did not address whether it had plans to change or review its Kindle store policies around authors’ use of AI or other automated writing tools. “All books in the store must adhere to our content guidelines, including by complying with intellectual property rights and all other applicable laws,” Amazon spokeswoman Lindsay Hamilton said via email.

A spokeswoman for ChatGPT developer OpenAI declined to comment.

FROM CONCEPTION TO PUBLICATION IN JUST HOURS

Amazon is by far the largest seller of both physical and e-books, commanding well over half of sales in the United States and, by some estimates, over 80% of the e-book market. Its Kindle Direct Publishing service has spawned a cottage industry of self-published novelists, carving out particular niches for enthusiasts of erotic content and self-help books.

Amazon created Kindle Direct Publishing in 2007 to allow anyone to sell and market a book from their couch without the hassle or expense of seeking out literary agents or publishing houses. Generally, Amazon allows authors to publish instantly through the unit without any oversight, splitting whatever proceeds they generate.

That has attracted new AI-assisted authors like Kamil Banc, whose primary job is selling fragrances online, who bet his wife he could make a book from conception to publication in less than one day. Using ChatGPT, an AI image creator and prompts like ""write a bedtime story about a pink dolphin that teaches children how to be honest,"" Banc published an illustrated 27-page book in December. Available on Amazon, ""Bedtime Stories: Short and Sweet, For a Good Night’s Sleep"" took Banc about four hours to create, he said.

Consumer interest so far has been admittedly sleepy: Banc said sales have totaled about a dozen copies. But readers rated it worthy of five stars, including one who praised its ""wonderful and memorable characters.""

Banc has since published two more AI-generated books, including an adult coloring book, with more in the works. ""It actually is really simple,"" he said. ""I was surprised at how fast it went from concept to publishing.""

Not everyone is blown away by the software. Mark Dawson, who has reportedly sold millions of copies of books he wrote himself through Kindle Direct Publishing, was quick to call ChatGPT-assisted novels ""dull"" in an email to Reuters.

""Merit plays a part in how books are recommended to other readers. If a book gets bad reviews because the writing is dull then it’s quickly going to sink to the bottom.""

REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay















BRUSSELS, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has struck a 10-year deal to bring ""Call of Duty"" and other Activision (ATVI.O) games to Nvidia Corp's (NVDA.O) gaming platform if the Xbox maker is allowed to complete its much-contested $69 billion acquisition of Activision.

Regulators and competitors like Sony have come out hard against the proposed Microsoft-Activision tie-up. The move may allay concerns by ensuring more ways for consumers to get games controlled by Microsoft, but regulators around the world have been skeptical about the acquisition.

Britain earlier this month said the deal could harm gamers by weakening the rivalry between Xbox and PlayStation, resulting in higher prices, fewer choices and less innovation for millions of players, as well as stifling competition in cloud gaming.

Microsoft President Brad Smith told a news conference on Tuesday he was now more optimistic of getting the Activision acquisition done after the Nvidia deal and a similar arrangement with Nintendo Co Ltd (7974.T).

Phil Eisler, vice president and general manager of Nvidia's GeForce Now segment, said that titles such that ""Call of Duty"" will not be available on Nvidia's service unless Microsoft acquires Activision but that other Microsoft-owned titles such as ""Minecraft"" are covered immediately under the 10-year license agreement.

""We were a little concerned about it at the beginning,"" Eisler said of the Microsoft-Activision deal. ""But then we reached out to Microsoft, and they were very open about wanting to enable cloud gaming and work with us on a 10-year license agreement. So over time, they made us more and more comfortable with it.""

Eisler said Nvidia is not paying Microsoft for access to the titles, which is the same arrangement the company has with other gaming companies such as ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games. Instead, Nvidia's 25 million customers will need to pay Nvidia for access to its cloud gaming platform and pay Microsoft for its games.

Shares of Microsoft fell 2%, Nvidia dropped 3.4% and Activision fell 0.7% in a broadly lower market on Tuesday afternoon.

Nvidia said it now supports the Xbox maker's bid to purchase Activision, but the deal could still be a hard sell with regulators. European officials issued Microsoft a warning about the deal earlier this month, while the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has asked a judge to block it. The British competition watchdog has said Microsoft may have to divest ""Call of Duty.""

Smith said he hoped that rival Sony Group Corp (6758.T) will consider doing the same type of deal with Nvidia.

Sony has led opposition to the Microsoft-Activision deal, saying last year it was ""bad for competition, bad for the gaming industry and bad for gamers themselves.""

Apart from Sony and Nvidia, other companies including Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google had expressed concerns to the FTC about the deal, according to media reports.

Microsoft has pledged to keep ""Call of Duty"" on Sony's PlayStation. The popularity of the first-person shooter franchise is undimmed nearly two decades after launch, with the latest installment achieving $1 billion sales in its first 10 days in October.

The U.S. tech giant has said the deal is about more than ""Call of Duty."" It has said buying the company that also makes ""Overwatch"" and ""Candy Crush"" would charge its growth in mobile, PC, and cloud gaming, as well as consoles, helping it compete with the likes of Tencent (0700.HK) as well as Sony.

738,146,Microsoft,2023-02-21,"Microsoft's president to push Activision deal at EU hearing; Google, Nvidia also present","













BRUSSELS, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) President Brad Smith on Tuesday will seek to convince EU antitrust regulators at a closed hearing that the U.S. software giant's $69 billion bid for ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) will boost competition.

Smith will lead a delegation of 18 senior executives, including Microsoft Gaming Chief Executive Officer Phil Spencer, while Activision will be represented by its CEO Robert Kotick, a European Commission document seen by Reuters showed.

The hearing will allow Xbox maker Microsoft to gauge the mood among senior EU and national competition officials and European Commission lawyers ahead of the submission of remedies to address antitrust concerns.

""I think we will make clear that our acquisition of Activision Blizzard will bring more games to more people on more devices and platforms than ever before,"" Smith told reporters on his way to the hearing.

Microsoft was willing to address concerns with ""Call of Duty"" licensing offers similar to the 10-year deal with Nintendo (7974.T) and regulatory undertakings, Smith added, without providing any further details.

Microsoft announced the Activision acquisition in January last year to take on leaders Tencent (0700.HK) and Sony (6758.T), but has run into regulatory headwinds in Europe, Britain and the United States.

Sony, which wants the deal to be blocked, sent its gaming chief Jim Ryan.

Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google and chip designer and computing firm Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), which has a gaming business, also took part in the hearing.

""The European Commission asked for our views in the course of their inquiries into this issue. We will continue to cooperate in any processes, when requested, to ensure all views are considered,"" a Google spokesperson said.

Nvidia declined to comment. The European Games Developer Federation, which has said the deal will allow Microsoft to challenge Apple (AAPL.O), Google and Tencent, is one of the participants.

Video game distributor Valve, video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA.O) and the German competition watchdog and its peers in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Sweden will also be taking part in the event.

739,206,Microsoft,2023-02-21,Amazon Web Services pairs with Hugging Face to target AI developers,"













Feb 21 (Reuters) - Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud computing arm of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), on Tuesday said it is collaborating with startup Hugging Face, a software development hub, to make it easier to carry out artificial intelligence work (AI) in Amazon's cloud.

While new generative AI services like chat-based search engines from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O) have captured the public's imagination, tech companies such as AWS are also vying behind the scenes to supply the tools and services that software developers will need to weave similar technology into their own products.

AWS, the biggest cloud computing provider, already offers tools to help developers create AI-based software, including proprietary computing chips for raining AI algorithms on huge amounts of data at lower cost than rivals to services that reduce how much time it takes to create a chatbot or other AI products.

On Tuesday, AWS said it will work with Hugging Face, a New York-based company that has become a central place online where AI developers share open-source code and models. Clem Delangue, Hugging Face's chief executive, said that while the deal is not exclusive, the startup is working closely with AWS on making it easy for developers to take code from the site and run it on the AWS cloud.

""For this product collaboration, we're dedicating significant engineering resources to build our shared products,"" Delangue told Reuters in interview.

Delangue also said the next generation of Bloom, an open-source AI model that competes in size and scope with the model that Microsoft-backed OpenAI used to create ChatGPT, will be run on Trainium, a proprietary artificial intelligence chip created by AWS.

Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of database, analytics and machine learning at AWS, said he believes technologies like Trainium can help developers save money as AI takes up more computing power and AWS wants to make it less time consuming for developers to adopt them.

""We want to make sure they have access to our silicon and networking innovations,"" Sivasubramanian told Reuters.

740,366,Microsoft,2023-02-21,France's Capgemini eases hiring due to tech sector slowdown,"Summary

Summary Companies Capgemini annual sales up 16.6% in constant currency

Sees weaker 2023 revenue growth

To slow down headcount intake in 2023

Shares fall 2.7%















Feb 21 (Reuters) - French IT consulting group Capgemini (CAPP.PA) on Tuesday forecast weaker revenue growth and said it would slow down hiring in 2023 amid a tech sector downturn.

The comments come as slowing growth, soaring inflation and a looming recession push tech companies including U.S. giants Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) to slash jobs.

Capgemini's shares were down 2.7% at 1048 GMT.

Capgemini, which offers consulting, digital, technical and engineering services, grew its workforce by 11% in 2022, reaching a headcount of 359,600 at the end of December. However, the number of staff rose just 0.3% from the end of September.

Chief Executive Aiman Ezzat said the group had slowed hiring in response to sluggish demand for cloud, data and artificial intelligence services.

""We are optimising our operation, taking advantage of the lower attrition and also factoring the fact that we have lower growth in front of us,"" Ezzat told analysts in a call.

""(I'm) not going to do a prediction regarding headcount growth, but to see our growth in 2023, we'll have to increase headcount,"" he added.

Capgemini expects its 2023 revenue to grow between 4% and 7% in constant currency, compared with 16.6% last year.

Its annual revenue reached 22 billion euros ($23.48 billion) on bookings of 23.7 billion euros, an increase of 16.8% at constant exchange rates.

The Paris-based company also forecast 2023 operating margin in a range of 13.0% to 13.2%, and organic free cash flow of around 1.8 billion euros.

($1 = 0.9371 euros)

741,527,Microsoft,2023-02-21,China Fudan University team apologises after ChatGPT-style platform crashes hours after launch,"













BEIJING, Feb 21 (Reuters) - A team from China's Fudan University apologised on Tuesday after a ChatGPT-like chatbot platform they developed crashed hours after it launched to the public, due to a sudden surge of traffic.

The team's announcement on Monday of the platform they called MOSS instantly went viral on Chinese social media, generating tens of millions of hits on China's Twitter-like Weibo. State media described it as the first Chinese rival to OpenAI's hit ChatGPT platform.

But MOSS, which bears the same name as a superintelligent quantum computer in Chinese sci-fi blockbuster ""Wandering Earth 2"", crashed soon after and by Tuesday the team said it would no longer be open to the public.

The launch of MOSS and the public response to it underlines the fervour for generative AI and ChatGPT in China and the challenges its domestic industry faces, as several of China's top universities and tech companies race to produce a Chinese version of the Microsoft-backed (MSFT.O) chatbot.

While the Fudan University team had on Monday initially described MOSS as a conversational language model like ChatGPT, on Tuesday they played down the comparison, saying they had much to improve.

""MOSS is still a very immature model, it is still has a long way to go before reaching ChatGPT. An academic research lab like us is unable to produce a model whose ability nears ChatGPT,"" a statement published on its website said.

""Our computing resources were not enough to support such large traffic and as an academic group we do not have sufficient engineering experience, creating a very bad experience and first impression on everyone, and we hereby express our heartfelt apologies to everyone.""

ChatGPT, the fastest-growing consumer application in history, has also crashed several times due to heavy traffic.

While few users were able to share their experiences of the platform before the crash, a journalist from the Shanghai Observer shared a detailed account of an interaction with MOSS and said that the chatbot's English was better than its Chinese.

The team's leader, Qiu Xipeng, a professor at Fudan's School of Computer Science, told the Shanghai Observer on Monday that the main gap between MOSS and ChatGPT was that the number of parameters put into MOSS' language training was an order of magnitude smaller than ChatGPT.

Qiu did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.

742,455,Microsoft,2023-02-21,Qualcomm announces software business around its supply chain chips,"













Feb 21 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) on Tuesday said it is launching a paid cloud software service to help companies that use its chips keep tabs on goods as they move through the supply chain.

The San Diego, California company is the world's biggest provider of chips that help smartphones connect to mobile data networks. But Qualcomm has used its wireless communication specialty to enter other markets where devices need to talk to the internet, such as automobiles and factories.

Qualcomm Aware, as the new service is called, works with Qualcomm chips that go into tracking devices for shipping containers, pallets, packages and other parts of supply chains to help companies track where their goods and materials are.

Most of those trackers are made by third parties, but Qualcomm makes a few devices of its own, such as a tilt sensor that can be attached to utility poles to report whether they have toppled over during storms.

Qualcomm has already shipped hundreds of millions of the chips involved, which typically cost less than $10 each, Jeff Torrance, senior vice president and general manager of Qualcomm's smart connected systems business, told Reuters in an interview.

The software service announced Tuesday aims to let Qualcomm customers program their chips from one central spot, with updates sent to the chips over the air.

The service also aims to make better use of the data from the chips.

Torrance said Qualcomm's software will connect to other cloud-based such as Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Dynamics 365 service, which corporations use to keep tabs on their inventory and supplies.

Companies could use the two systems to build things like virtual dashboards that show where all of a firm's inventory is at a given moment.

Qualcomm did not publicly announce pricing for the new service, but it represents a push to make more money off its chips by charging when the chip is sold then for cloud-based services using the chip afterward.

""We believe there's value in the chip and in the cloud service,"" Torrance told Reuters.

743,418,Microsoft,2023-02-22,Amazon delivers a regulatory breather to Big Tech,"













WASHINGTON, Feb 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Trustbusters may have finally discovered their eyes are bigger than their stomachs. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said it won’t challenge Amazon.com’s (AMZN.O) $3.9 billion acquisition of physician network One Medical. As the deal moves forward, deal-hungry technology giants can take a small breather.

Wednesday’s decision stands out because the FTC has so been so aggressive under Chair Lina Khan. Among other initiatives, the agency has sued Microsoft (MSFT.O) for its planned $69 billion takeover of video-game developer Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) and lost its case trying to stop Meta Platforms (META.O) from buying virtual reality app maker Within Unlimited. Amazon’s purchase of Roomba-maker iRobot (IRBT.O) remains under scrutiny.

The agency may be picking its battles more carefully, however. One Medical’s revenue accounted for just 0.2% of all U.S. healthcare spending in 2021, according to Amazon. Its own presence in the market is even smaller. Proving the deal was anticompetitive would have been tough.

And while the FTC’s concerns about Big Tech seemed limitless, its resources aren’t. Letting the One Medical deal move forward frees up staff to focus on ones that pose a clearer threat to consumers. Only some acquirers can rest easier. (By Ben Winck)

744,436,Microsoft,2023-02-22,Meta preparing for fresh round of job cuts - Washington Post,"













Feb 22 (Reuters) - Facebook-parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) is planning a fresh round of job cuts in a reorganization and downsizing effort that could affect thousands of workers, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday.

Last year, the social media company let go 13% of its workforce - more than 11,000 employees - as it grappled with soaring costs and a weak advertising market.

Meta now plans to push some leaders into lower-level roles without direct reports, flattening the layers of management between top boss Mark Zuckerberg and the company's interns, the Washington Post reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.

Meta declined a Reuters request for comment, but spokesperson Andy Stone in a series of tweets cited several previous statements by Zuckerberg suggesting that more cuts were on the way.

Zuckerberg told investors earlier this month that last year's layoffs were ""the beginning of our focus on efficiency and not the end."" He said he would work on ""flattening our org structure and removing some layers of middle management.""

Last year's layoffs were the first in Meta's 18-year history. Other tech companies have cut thousands of jobs, including Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Snap Inc .

Meta aggressively hired during the COVID pandemic to meet a surge in social media usage by stuck-at-home consumers. But business suffered in 2022 as advertisers pulled the plug on spending in the face of rapidly rising interest rates.

Meta, once worth more than $1 trillion, is now valued at $446 billion. Meta shares were down about 0.5% on Wednesday.

The company has said it would also reduce office space, lower discretionary spending and extend a hiring freeze into 2023 to rein in expenses.

More than 100,000 layoffs were announced at U.S. companies in January, led by technology companies, according to a report from employment firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc.

745,672,Microsoft,2023-02-22,"Australia tells Twitter, Google to give information on handling online child abuse","[1/2] A keyboard is placed in front of a displayed Twitter logo in this illustration taken February 21, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration















SYDNEY, Feb 23 (Reuters) - An Australian regulator has sent legal letters to Twitter and Google telling them to hand over information about their efforts to stop online child abuse, drawing them into a crackdown that has already put pressure on other global tech firms.

The action by the country's e-safety commissioner keeps a spotlight on the anti-exploitation practices at Twitter under the ownership of billionaire Elon Musk, who called child protection his top priority while also laying off more than half its employees since taking over last October.

""With Elon Musk declaring child sexual abuse a top priority, this is an opportunity for him to explain what he is indeed doing,"" e-safety commissioner Julie Inman Grant told Reuters in an interview, referring to several of Musk's tweets.

She said it was in Twitter's interests to show that it was acting effectively to eradicate child sexual abuse material, otherwise advertisers could turn away from the company.

Inman Grant, who had served as a public policy director for Twitter until 2016, said the responses of larger tech firms, coupled with reports of looser content moderation at Twitter since Musk took over, prompted her to take action.

Twitter closed its Australian office after Musk's buyout so there was no local representative to respond to Reuters, and a request for comment sent to the San Francisco-based company's media email address was not immediately answered.

Apart from writing to Twitter, the commissioner also sent letters to Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, owner of YouTube and the file storage unit Google Drive, and China's TikTok.

Google's senior manager of government affairs and public policy Samantha Yorke said abuse material had no place on the company's platforms and ""we utilise a range of industry standard scanning techniques including hash-matching technology and artificial intelligence to identify and remove (child abuse material) that has been uploaded to our services"".

TikTok's policy manager for Australia Jed Horner said in a statement the company had a zero-tolerance approach to dissemination of abuse material with more than 40,000 safety professionals globally ""who develop and enforce our policies, and build processes and technologies to detect, remove or restrict violative content at scale"".

Under new laws in Australia, the e-safety commissioner, an office set up to protect internet users, can compel internet companies to give detailed information about the frequency of child exploitation on their platforms and about measures they take to stamp it out.

Companies that fail to cooperate face fines of up to A$700,000 ($478,000) per day.

Last year, the commissioner sent similar notices to Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META.O). After receiving their responses, the commissioner called their practices inadequate. read more

Inman Grant said a 2020 joint investigation with the Canadian Centre for Child Protection found widespread publicly-available abuse material on Twitter, which those authorities reported to Twitter's head of trust and safety.

""When you compound that with Elon Musk coming here, eviscerating the trust and safety team, but also cutting the local public policy externally-facing folks, and then allowing some of the worst of the worst actors back on, you're going to have a lot of bad actors, fewer guardrails,"" she said, commenting on the job cuts at Twitter.

Although Twitter had effectively closed its Australian unit, Inman Grant said her office had extra-territorial powers to fine companies abroad, but she hoped the public attention would prompt Twitter to cooperate.

746,735,Microsoft,2023-02-22,Morning Bid: Hang on a minute,"













A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan

Only seven weeks into the new year and many of the year's favoured investments look spent already - or at least they require something of a rethink.

With Wall St stocks clocking their worst day of 2023 on Tuesday, many of the big consensus trades - short dollar, long bonds and long emerging markets - all look questionable if the U.S. and world economies are re-acclerating, buoying above-target inflation and forcing central banks to tighten further.

At 4.73%, two-year U.S. Treasury yields closed at their highest in 15 years. The dollar have wiped out all of February gains.

Whether or not stocks are in what Morgan Stanley strategist Mike Wilson likens to the 'death zone' at the top of Everest, some soul searching is underway nonetheless. And markets have calmed a little early on Wednesday.

Minutes of the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting are due for release on Wednesday - but data releases showing sticky inflation, booming retail sales and a service sector back in expansion emerged after that meeting. And so a speech from New York Fed chief John Williams make give a better steer on current thinking.

Markets are now priced for a Fed 'terminal rate' in the 5.25-5.50% range by July and no cut from there by year-end.

European central bankers are also talking tough as the region's economies dodge recession and inflation stays high. Deutsche Bank lifted its forecast for where the European Central Bank's key rate will peak in this tightening cycle to 3.75% from 3.25% previously - 125bp up from current rates.

The only positive inflation news was that ebbing world oil prices are now tracking year-on-year declines of 15% as huge base effects from last February's Ukraine invasion kick in. Weak U.S. housing updates and downbeat retail readouts from Walmart and Home Depot also question the prevailing narrative.

But geopolitical concerns rankle again ahead of Friday's anniversary, with Russia unilaterally withdrawing from a key nuclear arms control treaty.

As G20 finance chiefs meet in India, the world is watching closely the extent of the alliance between Beijing and Moscow. According to the Wall Street Journal, China's top diplomat has indicated that Beijing's relationship with Moscow is ""rock solid"" and Chinese leader Xi Jinping is preparing to visit Moscow for a summit with Vladimir Putin in the coming months.

Elsewhere, the Bank of Japan doubled down again on its bond yield cap as Japan's 10-year government bond yield breached the BoJ's policy band for a second straight session. Big manufacturers in Japan remained gloomy in February too.

In banking, shares of Lloyds (LLOY.L) fell 2.6% after Britain's biggest mortgage lender reported a flat annual profit for 2022 as a jump in interest income was offset by mounting bad loan provisions. Lloyds said falling house prices, competition for savings and rising costs may crimp future returns.

With results from Nvidia due on Wednesday, Microsoft (MSFT.O) struck a 10-year deal to bring ""Call of Duty"" and other Activision (ATVI.O) games to Nvidia's (NVDA.O) gaming platform if the Xbox maker is allowed to complete a much-contested $69 billion acquisition of Activision.

Coinbase Global (COIN.O) reported a fourth-quarter loss, as trading volume at the cryptocurrency exchange came under pressure from an industry-wide downturn triggered by a string of high-profile bankruptcies.

Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday:

* U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee releases minutes from its latest meeting; New York Fed President John Williams speaks

* G20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs meet in Bengaluru in southern India

* U.S. Treasury sells 5-year notes, 2-year floating rate notes

* U.S. corp earnings: NVIDIA, EBay, NetApp, ETSY, Garmin, Allegion etc

AMSTERDAM, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Bill Gates has bought 3.76% stake in Dutch drinks giant Heineken Holding NV (HEIO.AS), although the billionaire founder of Microsoft has previously said he was ""not a big beer drinker.""

The filing by the Netherlands' Financial Markets Authority (AFM) said the shares were purchased on Feb. 17. Heineken Holding owns a controlling stake in brewer Heineken NV (HEIN.AS).

Gates purchased the shares from Mexico's FEMSA, which is selling out of the brewing company.

A separate filing also dated Feb. 17 showed FEMSA sold all 18 million shares it held in Heineken Holding. Gates purchased 10.8 million shares, worth 883 million euros ($939.87 million) at current market prices, triggering a disclosure requirement under Dutch stock market rules.

In a 2018 ""Ask Me Anything"" chat session on Reddit, Gates said he was ""not a big beer drinker.""

""When I end up at something like a baseball game I drink light beer to get with the vibe of all the other beer drinkers. Sorry to disappoint real beer drinkers.""

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the charitable foundation launched by the billionaire and his former wife, wasn't immediately available for comment.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Feb 22 (Reuters) - As Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) looks past a chatbot flub that helped erase $100 billion from its market value, another challenge is emerging from its efforts to add generative artificial intelligence to its popular Google Search: the cost.

Executives across the technology sector are talking about how to operate AI like ChatGPT while accounting for the high expense. The wildly popular chatbot from OpenAI, which can draft prose and answer search queries, has ""eye-watering"" computing costs of a couple or more cents per conversation, the startup's Chief Executive Sam Altman has said on Twitter.

In an interview, Alphabet's Chairman John Hennessy told Reuters that having an exchange with AI known as a large language model likely cost 10 times more than a standard keyword search, though fine-tuning will help reduce the expense quickly.

Even with revenue from potential chat-based search ads, the technology could chip into the bottom line of Mountain View, Calif.-based Alphabet with several billion dollars of extra costs, analysts said. Its net income was nearly $60 billion in 2022.

Morgan Stanley estimated that Google's 3.3 trillion search queries last year cost roughly a fifth of a cent each, a number that would increase depending on how much text AI must generate. Google, for instance, could face a $6-billion hike in expenses by 2024 if ChatGPT-like AI were to handle half the queries it receives with 50-word answers, analysts projected. Google is unlikely to need a chatbot to handle navigational searches for sites like Wikipedia.

Others arrived at a similar bill in different ways. For instance, SemiAnalysis, a research and consulting firm focused on chip technology, said adding ChatGPT-style AI to search could cost Alphabet $3 billion, an amount limited by Google's in-house chips called Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, along with other optimizations.

What makes this form of AI pricier than conventional search is the computing power involved. Such AI depends on billions of dollars of chips, a cost that has to be spread out over their useful life of several years, analysts said. Electricity likewise adds costs and pressure to companies with carbon-footprint goals.

The process of handling AI-powered search queries is known as ""inference,"" in which a ""neural network"" loosely modeled on the human brain's biology infers the answer to a question from prior training.

In a traditional search, by contrast, Google's web crawlers have scanned the internet to compile an index of information. When a user types a query, Google serves up the most relevant answers stored in the index.

Alphabet's Hennessy told Reuters, ""It's inference costs you have to drive down,"" calling that ""a couple year problem at worst.""

Alphabet is facing pressure to take on the challenge despite the expense. Earlier this month, its rival Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) held a high-profile event at its Redmond, Washington headquarters to show off plans to embed AI chat technology into its Bing search engine, with top executives taking aim at Google's search market share of 91%, by Similarweb's estimate.

A day later, Alphabet talked about plans to improve its search engine, but a promotional video for its AI chatbot Bard showed the system answering a question inaccurately, fomenting a stock slide that shaved $100 billion off its market value.

Microsoft later drew scrutiny of its own when its AI reportedly made threats or professed love to test users, prompting the company to limit long chat sessions it said ""provoked"" unintended answers.

Microsoft's Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood has told analysts that the upside from gaining users and advertising revenue outweighed expenses as the new Bing rolls out to millions of consumers. ""That's incremental gross margin dollars for us, even at the cost to serve that we're discussing,"" she said.

And another Google competitor, CEO of search engine You.com Richard Socher, said adding an AI chat experience as well as applications for charts, videos and other generative tech raised expenses between 30% and 50%. ""Technology gets cheaper at scale and over time,"" he said.

A source close to Google cautioned it's early to pin down exactly how much chatbots might cost because efficiency and usage vary widely depending on the technology involved, and AI already powers products like search.

Still, footing the bill is one of two main reasons why search and social media giants with billions of users have not rolled out an AI chatbot overnight, said Paul Daugherty, Accenture's chief technology officer.

""One is accuracy, and the second is you have to scale this in the right way,"" he said.

MAKING THE MATH WORK

For years, researchers at Alphabet and elsewhere have studied how to train and run large language models more cheaply.

Bigger models require more chips for inference and therefore cost more. AI that dazzles consumers for its human-like authority has ballooned in size, reaching 175 billion so-called parameters, or different values that the algorithm takes into account, for the model OpenAI updated into ChatGPT. Cost also varies by the length of a user's query, as measured in ""tokens"" or pieces of words.

One senior technology executive told Reuters that such AI remained cost-prohibitive to put in millions of consumers' hands.

""These models are very expensive, and so the next level of invention is going to be reducing the cost of both training these models and inference so that we can use it in every application,"" the executive said on condition of anonymity.

For now, computer scientists inside OpenAI have figured out how to optimize inference costs through complex code that makes chips run more efficiently, a person familiar with the effort said. An OpenAI spokesperson did not immediately comment.

A longer-term issue is how to shrink the number of parameters in an AI model 10 or even 100 times, without losing accuracy.

""How you cull (parameters away) most effectively, that's still an open question,"" said Naveen Rao, who formerly ran Intel Corp's AI chip efforts and now works to lower AI computing costs through his startup MosaicML.

In the meantime, some have considered charging for access, like OpenAI's $20 per month subscription for better ChatGPT service. Technology experts also said a workaround is applying smaller AI models to simpler tasks, which Alphabet is exploring.

The company said this month a ""smaller model"" version of its massive LaMDA AI technology will power its chatbot Bard, requiring ""significantly less computing power, enabling us to scale to more users.""

Asked about chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard, Hennessy said at a conference called TechSurge last week that more focused models, rather than one system doing everything, would help ""tame the cost.""

749,294,Microsoft,2023-02-22,"As chatbots boom, Nvidia sales outlook beats Wall Street expectations","













Feb 22 (Reuters) - Chip designer Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) forecast first-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates on Wednesday as its CEO said use of its chips to power artificial intelligence (AI) services like chatbots had ""gone through the roof in the last 60 days.""

The sales outlook drove Nvidia's shares up 8% in extended trading. The world's largest supplier of chips used in data centers for training AI has become a key hardware supplier for large tech companies such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) that are building services like chat-powered search engines.

AI is one of the few areas where tech companies are still spending even as the sector slashes jobs. Microsoft and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), for example, are both laying off thousands of employees but are also locked in a race to imbue their search engines with chatbot technology - despite the fact that doing so is likely to add billions of dollars to their operating costs.

Analysts believe that Nvidia, more than any other company, is best positioned to benefit from such increased costs as it dominates roughly 80% of the market for graphics processing units, or GPUs, used to speed up AI work.

On a conference call with investors, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang announced a new service in which Nvidia will directly offer its cloud computing service for companies to rent all of its technologies to develop their own ""generative"" AI services that can create text, images and other forms of data.

AI is still ""not deployed in enterprises broadly, but we believe that by hosting everything in the cloud, from the infrastructure through the operating system software, all the way through pre-trained models, we can accelerate the adoption of generative AI in enterprises,"" Huang said.

The company forecast current-quarter revenue of $6.50 billion, plus or minus 2%. Analysts on average expect $6.33 billion in revenue, according to Refinitiv data.

Revenue in the quarter ended Jan. 29 was $6.05 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $6.01 billion.

""The launch of generative AI models and the AI arms race taking place should drive accelerated adoption of the company's new H100 products,"" said Logan Purk, an analyst with Edward Jones.

Nvidia's outlook also helped boost the share prices of competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), whose stocks were up 3% after Nvidia's results.

The Santa Clara, California, company got its start in the graphics chip business for PCs by helping video games look more realistic. While its revenue beat Wall Street expectations, Nvidia's sales were still down overall year-on-year as the company weathers a downturn in the PC market.

But growth has remained brisk in the market for data center chips. Analysts at Bank of America Global research believe the boom in so-called generative AI like chatbot and image creation services could add $14 billion more to Nvidia's revenue by 2027.

Nvidia's revenue from the data center business was $3.62 billion for the fourth quarter, slightly below analyst estimates of $3.84 billion. Gaming chip sales were $1.83 billion, beating analyst estimates of $1.52 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Adjusted profit was 88 cents per share for the fourth quarter, beating analyst estimates of 81 cents.

750,528,Microsoft,2023-02-22,"Baidu beats fourth-quarter revenue estimates, flags chatbot launch","













Feb 22 (Reuters) - China's Baidu Inc (9888.HK) beat revenue estimates for the fourth quarter on Wednesday, bolstered by strength in its advertising, cloud and artificial intelligence businesses, sending its U.S.-listed shares up 7% in premarket trading.

The search engine giant, which generates most of its revenue from online ads, is seeing advertisers return after China lifted its zero-COVID policies last year in a boost to the country's economic prospects.

The company also announced a new share repurchase program of up to $5 billion.

Revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 31 came in at 33.08 billion yuan ($4.80 billion), inching past analysts' estimates of 32.01 billion yuan, according to Refinitiv data.

Revenue from Baidu Core, which includes search-based ad sales, cloud offerings and its autonomous driving initiatives, fell 1% to 25.7 billion yuan.

While non-online marketing revenue rose 11% to 7.6 billion yuan, driven by AI and cloud businesses, strict pandemic-related controls in China caused the company's online marketing revenue to drop 6% to 18.1 billion yuan in the reported quarter.

""2022 was a challenging year ... in 2023, we believe we have a clear path to re-accelerate our revenue growth, and we are now well positioned to make use of the opportunities that China's economic recovery offers us,"" Baidu's Chief Executive Officer Robin Li said.

The company's research and development expenses for the whole of 2022 were 23.3 billion yuan, an equivalent of 18.8% of revenue, as it plans to integrate its hotly anticipated, ChatGPT-like Ernie Bot into Baidu's mainstream businesses, including search engine, cloud and smart cars.

Baidu's AI-driven chatbot, seen by many as being at the forefront of China’s efforts to develop a rival to the platform developed by OpenAI and backed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), will complete internal testing in March.

""The Chinese AI market is on the verge of experiencing an explosive growth in demand, releasing unprecedented and exponential commercial value,"" Li said.

He added that the developers of Ernie Bot were sparing no effort to ensure the chatbot was made available as early as possible.

Li also said during a conference call that Ernie Bot would be first embedded in Baidu's search engine and that its Chinese-language capabilities were state of the art.

""The generative large-language model we are working on right now will be more suitable in Chinese language and to the China market than models developed overseas,"" Li said.

751,28,Microsoft,2023-02-22,Explainer: How Microsoft is addressing antitrust concerns over Activision deal,"













BRUSSELS, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) has thrown the gauntlet down over antitrust criticisms, saying on Tuesday it is ready to offer rivals licensing deals in exchange for regulatory approval of its $69 billion deal to purchase video game publisher Activision (ATVI.O), but it would not to sell the latter's lucrative ""Call of Duty"" franchise.

WHAT IS THE ACTIVISION DEAL?

Microsoft announced the Activision bid in January last year, its biggest ever, to boost its firepower in the booming videogaming market and take on leaders Tencent (0700.HK) and Sony (6758.T), and lay the base for its investment in metaverse, digital spaces which are made more lifelike by the use of virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR).

WHAT DO ANTITRUST REGULATORS SAY?

In December, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) asked a judge to block the deal, saying it would give Microsoft's Xbox exclusive access to Activision games and leave out Sony's Playstation and Nintendo consoles.

The UK competition agency CMA has suggested divesting Call of Duty to address its concerns while the European Commission has warned Microsoft about the possible anti-competitive impact of the deal.

WHO ARE THE CRITICS AND FANS OF THE DEAL?

Market leader Sony wants the deal to be blocked. A group of 10 gamers in the United States has filed a private consumer antitrust lawsuit over the deal.

The European Games Development Federation, with more than 2,500 game studios in 22 European countries, and the UNI Global Union back the acquisition.

WHAT HAS MICROSOFT PRESIDENT SAID AND OFFERED?

Microsoft President Brad Smith said he doesn't think ""it is feasible or realistic to think that one game or one slice of this company (Activision) can be carved out and separated from the rest"" and that he doesn't ""see a viable path to sell the Activision studio for the quality of the game to someone else.""

Smith said the CMA has a choice to either kill the deal and cement Sony's 80% market share in Europe or clear it with behavioural remedies such as the licensing deals with Nintendo and Nvidia that will bring Call of Duty to 150 more million people.

WHAT ARE THE NINTENDO AND NVIDIA LICENSING DEALS?

Both companies have signed 10-year licensing deals that will bring Call of Duty to their gaming platforms but these are conditional on the Activision deal being approved.

WILL MICROSOFT'S TACTIC WORK?

Behavioral remedies like licensing deals are a hard sell for the CMA which flexed its muscles in 2021 when it ordered Facebook owner Meta to sell animated-images platform Giphy after the deal had been completed.

The European Commission could be more open to such remedies if they can allay their concerns, but it is still too early to tell.

WHO HAS GIVEN THE GREEN LIGHT SO FAR?

Brazil, Chile, Serbia and Saudi Arabia have given unconditional approval.

WHAT NEXT?

The EU antitrust enforcer's decision is due by April 11 but the deadline can be extended depending on when remedies are offered.

The CMA has given Microsoft until 1700 GMT Feb. 22 to comment on possible remedies, with a response hearing possible by early March, final submissions and responses in March and April 26 for a final report.

Microsoft's Smith said the company would fight the FTC's request to block the deal.

752,370,Microsoft,2023-02-22,Comcast takes advantage of AI rally to sell more BuzzFeed shares,"













Feb 22 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp has cut its stake in BuzzFeed Inc by 8.5% since the end of January, cashing in on a rally in the shares of the digital media company on reports of a plan to partner with OpenAI, the artificial intelligence firm behind ChatGPT.

It has so far sold more than 11 million BuzzFeed shares (BZFD.O) since Jan. 30, reducing its stake to 15.5% from 24%. The sale fetched Comcast about $28 million, according to a Reuters calculation.

It sold roughly four million shares for an average price of around $2.90 apiece at the end of January, and most recently dumped another 500,000 shares for an average of $2.05 a share, filings by Comcast (CMCSA.O) showed.

NBCUniversal, Comcast's entertainment unit, had invested $200 million in BuzzFeed in 2015 and injected another $200 million in 2016, valuing the company at around $1.7 billion.

As of Tuesday's close, BuzzFeed had a market value of just about $250 million. The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Shares of BuzzFeed, which were trading at 69 cents at the close of 2022, surged as high as $4.25 in January following media reports of a multi-million dollar content deal with Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and plans to use OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Retail investor interest in AI-related shares have been rising since last month after OpenAI drew a multi-billion dollar investment from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

BuzzFeed, which is known for its online quizzes, reduced its workforce in 2022 as businesses cut down on ad spending on concerns over a slowing economy.

Its shares were down 5.4% on Wednesday, while Comcast rose 0.6%.

753,611,Microsoft,2023-02-22,"Baidu's ChatGPT-like app will revolutionise its search engine, says CEO","













BEIJING, Feb 23 (Reuters) - China's Baidu Inc (9888.HK) will use its ChatGPT-like app Ernie Bot to create a ""revolutionary"" version of its popular search engine, the company's CEO said on Wednesday.

Baidu, which has invested heavily in artificial intelligence in recent years, is regarded as at the forefront of efforts to create a Chinese rival to the AI platform developed by OpenAI and backed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

Ahead of Ernie Bot’s launch in March, Baidu CEO Robin Li told reporters on a conference call to discuss fourth-quarter results that users would be more dependent on the Baidu search engine once it was embedded with the chatbot. That is because the generative AI powering it would enhance user experience and engagement.

""Ernie Bot will ... enhance the user experience and users will be much more dependent on us for all kinds of tasks and needs, therefore, significantly expand the market size of search (engines),"" Li said.

He added that online advertising, the company's main source of revenue, would also be boosted by the integration of Ernie Bot into the search engine. Baidu plans eventually to build an AI ecosystem around Ernie Bot, he said.

The details of Li's vision for the chatbot come amid a gradual decline in the dominance Baidu once enjoyed as the Chinese answer to Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, which pulled its search engine out of the Chinese market in 2010.

Tencent's (0700.HK) all-in-one messaging app, WeChat, and Bytedance's Douyin are among the competitors that have chipped away at Baidu's market share in recent years.

The company has created new revenue streams by expanding its core business to include AI, cloud services and autonomous driving, as well as pouring money into research and development.

Li said on Wednesday that the generative AI technology underpinning Ernie Bot would be a productivity boon to other businesses and entrepreneurs looking to build their own apps.

Since early February, more than 400 companies have signed up to join the Ernie Bot community as early users of the app, Baidu has said.

Dozens of Chinese tech companies, including e-commerce giants Alibaba Group (9988.HK) and JD.Com Inc (9618.HK), have announced plans to develop their own ChatGPT-style tools.

Li said Baidu has an advantage as the ""first mover"" in China's market. He said the company has spent years developing large language models that were trained on the billions of daily search requests inputted by its search engine's users.

He also said Ernie Bot was ""state of the art"" among large AI-driven language models in terms of understanding China's language and culture.

While OpenAI and ChatGPT are not blocked by Chinese authorities, OpenAI does not allow users in mainland China, Hong Kong, Iran, Russia and parts of Africa to sign up.

Summary

Summary Companies 12-week consultation will end May 19

'We hope to move very quickly' -Breton

Tech firms oppose what they say is an internet tax















BRUSSELS, Feb 23 (Reuters) - The European Commission drew criticism from Meta Platform (META.O) and other Big Tech firms on Thursday with the launch of a consultation on who should foot the bill for billions of euros of investments in Europe's telecoms network.

For more than two decades Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), Orange (ORAN.PA), Telefonica (TEF.MC), Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) and other operators have lobbied for leading technology companies to contribute to 5G and broadband roll-out.

They argue Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google, Apple (AAPL.O), Meta, Netflix (NFLX.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) account for more than half of data internet traffic.

The tech firms in response call it an internet tax that will undermine European Union network neutrality rules to treat all users equally. The 12-week consultation will end on May 19.

Meta, in its first public comments on the topic, said regulators should acknowledge Big Tech's investments.

""Meta invests tens of billions of dollars in our apps and platforms every year to facilitate the hosting of content, creating enormous value across the digital ecosystem,"" a spokesperson said.

""By not recognising that value flows both ways between telecoms companies and content-hosting platforms, this consultation is based on a false premise.""

EU industry chief Thierry Breton cited the heavy investments for 5G and broadband, saying he was not targeting any company.

""The burden of these investments is heavier and heavier. And that is in part because of a low return on investment in the telecoms sector, the increase of the cost of raw materials, and the world geopolitical context, the cost of energy, of course, because that has a big role to play,"" he told a news briefing.

""All of this reflection isn't aimed against anyone at all, rather it's for our fellow citizens,"" Breton said, adding that he was aware of time constraints in trying to wrap up the issue by the end of 2023.

""We hope to move very quickly so that in the summer we will be able to come back with conclusions and then we will see what we do to continue to make progress,"" he said.

Breton said a contributions mechanism could be one of the solutions. Other options include a continental or digital levy or fund according to a document seen by Reuters last month.

Telefonica CEO Jose Maria Alvarez-Pallete said Big Tech is as much a customer as other users.

""This would not be like a tax, we would charge them like they were customers, why do some customers pay and others not. It's correcting an anomaly,"" he told Reuters.

Telecoms lobbying group ETNO echoed this, saying the consultation was an urgent step to address major imbalances, but the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA) criticised the proposal in a statement.

""Europeans already pay telecom operators for internet access, they should not have to pay telcos a second time through pricier streaming and cloud services,"" said Christian Borggreen, CCIA Europe's senior vice president.

Any legislative proposal will need to be agreed with EU member states and EU lawmakers before it can become law.

756,501,Microsoft,2023-02-23,Taiwan's Delta Electronics sees EVs powering its double-digit growth,"













TAIPEI, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Taiwan's Delta Electronics Inc (2308.TW), a supplier of power components to companies such as Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), sees ""at least"" double-digit annual growth for the next five years driven by the electric vehicle (EV) boom, it said on Thursday.

Chairman Yancey Hai, in bullish comments on a fourth-quarter earnings call, said the company was benefiting from the shift away from traditional gasoline-powered vehicles to EVs.

""On average the company will grow at a double-digit rate for the next few years. If you say the mid-term is three to five years, I think our goal is to grow at least double digits for the next five years,"" he said.

Components like fans, which had previously mostly gone into goods like personal computers, are now increasingly going into EVs instead, Hai added, after the company reported its fourth-quarter gross profit leapt 32% year-on-year to T$29.6 billion ($974.55 million).

""So EVs are going to be one of the biggest drivers, and also data centres,"" he said, pointing to the ""huge"" centres companies such as Meta Platforms (META.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) are building.

Tesla said last week it will open part of its U.S. charging network to EVs made by rivals as part of a $7.5 billion federal programme to expand the use of EVs and cut carbon emissions.

Hai said that while the supply chain situation for Delta and car factories had improved a lot - the auto industry was particularly hard hit by COVID-related turmoil in China and a global chip shortage - there are still some chips such as microcontrollers facing minor shortages.

Delta, whose shareholders include Singapore's government, makes devices that control the flow of electricity in a range of products such as smartphones, personal computers, servers and electric vehicle charging stations.

Delta's shares have risen 1.2% so far this year, giving it a market value of $24.68 billion. They closed flat on Thursday, versus a 1.3% gain in the broader market (.TWII).

757,598,Microsoft,2023-02-23,Beijing mutes ChatGPT meme rally,"













HONG KONG, Feb 23 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The rally in Chinese stocks associated with conversational bots, a side-effect of the popularity of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, has been knocked sideways. Beijing has ordered big Chinese technology companies including Tencent (0700.HK) and Ant not to offer ChatGPT services on their platforms, the Nikkei reported citing people with direct knowledge. Meanwhile, state media, which once waxed lyrical about a “golden era” of gabby AI models, have pivoted to warning of their risks.

The official scrutiny has put the kibosh on an equity rally led by companies like Hanwang Technology (002362.SZ) and $47 billion search-engine operator Baidu (9888.HK), both of which are rolling out similar tools. The latter’s Hong Kong shares surged 45% between the start of the year and early February, before falling by a fifth since.

OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft (MSFT.O), won’t let Chinese residents create ChatGPT accounts. Yet many users have managed to get around this. Beijing is worried because the bot has not been trained to censor itself; indeed, even local copycats like ChatYuan have struggled to toe the Party line.

Chatbots’ conversational foibles can amuse or horrify, but their commercial applications are serious, ranging from technical support and troubleshooting code. Baidu's boss on Wednesday said its Ernie Bot would power a “revolutionary” search engine. Still, despite warm noises from Beijing about supporting technology companies, its politics still stifles innovation. (By Pete Sweeney)

758,737,Microsoft,2023-02-23,Nvidia results show its growing lead in AI chip race,"













Feb 23 (Reuters) - As the artificial intelligence boom takes off, Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) is expected to emerge as the biggest - though not the only - winner among chipmakers after years of focusing on the technology has made it a go-to supplier for tech firms.

AI has emerged as a bright spot for investments in the tech industry, whose slowing growth has led to widespread layoffs and a cutback on experimental bets.

The surge in interest helped Nvidia report better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday and it forecast sales above beat Wall Street expectations, in stark contrast to a projected loss and dividend cut from rival Intel Corp (INTC.O).

Nvidia's market valuation dwarfs that of Intel, AMD

Nvidia shares rose nearly 14% to $236.70 on Thursday. They have jumped more than 60% since the turn of the year, nearly three times the gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (.SOX).

The company got its start in the graphics chip business for PCs by helping video games look more realistic, and then rode the cryptocurrency wave as its chips were used for mining. Now, the next push comes from generative AI.

Nvidia's surge Thursday has boosted its market value by more than $70 billion. That brings it to more than $580 billion, about five times that of Intel. It is the seventh-largest publicly traded U.S. firm.

The key to the company's success is that it controls about 80% of the market for graphic processing units (GPUs), which are specialized chips that provide the kind of computing power required for services such as Microsoft-backed (MSFT.O) OpenAI's wildly popular ChatGPT chatbot.

SPECIALIZED CHIPS

Graphics processing units are designed to handle the specific kind of math involved in AI computing very efficiently, while generic central processing units (CPUs) from Intel can handle a broader range of computing tasks with less efficiency.

AI is taking over the tech industry and, according to research firm Gartner, the share of specialized chips such as GPUs that are used in data centers is expected to rise to more than 15% by 2026 from less than 3% in 2020.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), whose shares also rose after Nvidia earnings on Wednesday, is the second-biggest player in the GPU industry, with a market share of roughly 20%.

""The two companies that are leading the AI revolution on the hardware and processing side are Nvidia and AMD and, in our opinion, these two companies are head and shoulders above everybody else,"" Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar said.

Lisa Su-led AMD has made big investments in AI in recent years, including a series of chips designed to compete with Nvidia's fastest offerings. Intel holds a less than 1% share of the space.

Reuters Graphics

""The enthusiasm around ChatGPT and the potential use case it unlocks likely represents an inflection point in adoption of AI,"" said Lei Qiu, a technology fund portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein, which has a 0.54% stake in Nvidia.

""While it is hard to pinpoint exactly how big AI is today as a percent of (Nvidia's) revenue, it has the potential to grow exponentially as large tech companies race to develop similar types of AI applications,"" Qiu said.

Nvidia's strength in the AI industry has also attracted the attention of venture capitalists and startups, which are investing billions of dollars and promising improvements such as lower electricity consumption.

None of them have so far made a big dent in Nvidia's business.

INTEL NO LONGER INSIDE

All of this is bad news for Intel, which is also shedding CPU market share to AMD in the data center and personal computer industries that it once dominated. The company now risks losing out on the next growth leg of the industry.

It has in recent months made efforts to sharpen focus on GPUs including a move in December to split its graphic chips unit into two: one focused on personal computers and the other working on data center and AI.

Still, analysts say the company has a long way to go before Intel can make a dent in the market.

""Intel has more designs it has built to try and penetrate the (AI) market ... but to date it's seen a disappointing amount of traction despite its plethora of solutions,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Matthew Bryson said.

A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan

For markets increasingly wary of the inflation and interest rate implications of re-accelerating world growth, the positive of a new burst of economic confidence in the tech sector adds some cheer at least.

The new year craze in artificial intelligence and chatbots seems to have electrified chip designer Nvidia (NVDA.O), whose stock surged more than 8% before the bell after it forecast first-quarter revenue above Wall St estimates late Wednesday.

Its CEO Jensen Huang said use of its chips to power AI had ""gone through the roof in the last 60 days.""

The world's largest supplier of chips used in data centers for training AI has become a key hardware supplier for large tech companies such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) that are building services like chat-powered search engines.

Chip stocks rose around the world on Thursday in the slipstream of Nvidia's earnings report. S&P500 stock futures jumped about 0.5% and back above 4,000 points ahead of the open.

If the AI boom is one vignette in a world economy that appears to be skirting widely-forecast recession and regenerating some momentum, then the interest rate implications are considerable - not just in how high they go, but how long they stay up there.

The Federal Reserve at least seems keen on the higher-for-longer message that's shaken world stock and bond markets this week.

While most Fed policymakers rallied behind a decision to further slow the pace of interest rate hikes at its last policy meeting - suggesting some still saw another half-point rate rise as warranted - minutes from the meeting showed they all saw curbing unacceptably high inflation as the ""key factor"".

Bond yields rose following the release of the minutes and the U.S. dollar also advanced.

And as the minutes pre-date red-hot jobs and retail data for January, the message from Fed officials is probably even sterner now. New York Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams on Wednesday said the Fed is ""absolutely"" committed to bringing inflation back down to its 2% target over the next few years, by bringing demand down in line with constrained supply.

The signals from other central banks were similar. Bank of England interest rate-setter Catherine Mann said on Thursday that it was too soon to sound the all clear on inflation and the BoE should continue to raise borrowing costs.

Investors seem to be taking all that on board. A Reuters poll of equity analysts showed global stock markets are expected to correct in the next three months.

The Feb. 10-22 poll of more than 150 strategists, analysts and fund mangers covering 17 global stock indices, found that 56% were expecting their local market to fall in the next three months. A total of 48 out of 86 respondents said the chances of a correction were either high or very high.

But well chosen recovery stocks continue to do well. British engineering firm Rolls-Royce (RR.L) surged 18.1% on Thursday after the company's CEO forecast more profit growth in 2023 after last year's beat. A key factor was optimism around civil aerospace, the firm's biggest division, as travel recovers from the pandemic.

Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Thursday:

* US Q4 GDP revision and corporate profits estimate; weekly jobless claims; Kansas City Fed Feb business index; Chicago Fed Jan business index

* San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speak; Bank of Spain Governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos speaks

* G20 finance ministers and central bankers meet in Bengaluru in southern India; Japan chairs separate G7 finance chiefs meeting

* U.S. Treasury sells 7-year notes

* U.S. corp earnings: Intuit, Edison, Booking, Moderna, Alliant Energy, Autodesk, Teleflex, Newmont, Warner Bros Discovery, PG&E, Domino's, American Tower, American Electric Power, Keurig Dr Pepper, CBRE, Evergy etc

760,569,Microsoft,2023-02-24,Meta heats up Big Tech's AI arms race with new language model,"













Feb 24 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) said on Friday it was releasing to researchers a new large language model, the core software of a new artificial intelligence system, heating up an AI arms race as Big Tech companies rush to integrate the technology into their products and impress investors.

The public battle to dominate the AI technology space kicked off late last year with the launch of Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT and prompted tech heavyweights from Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) to China's Baidu Inc (9888.HK), to trumpet their own offerings.

Meta's LLaMA, short for Large Language Model Meta AI, will be available under non-commercial license to researchers and entities affiliated with government, civil society, and academia, it said in a blog.

Large language models mine vast amounts of text in order to summarize information and generate content. They can answer questions, for instance, with sentences that can read as though written by humans.

The model, which Meta said requires ""far less"" computing power than previous offerings, is trained on 20 languages with a focus on those with Latin and Cyrillic alphabets.

""Meta's announcement today appears to be a step in testing their generative AI capabilities so they can implement them into their products in the future,"" said Gil Luria, senior software analyst at D.A. Davidson.

""Generative AI is a new application of AI that Meta has less experience with, but is clearly important for the future of their business.""

AI has emerged as a bright spot for investments in the tech industry, whose slowing growth has prompted widespread layoffs and a cutback on experimental bets.

Meta said LLaMA could outperform competitors that examine more parameters, or variables that the algorithm takes into account.

Specifically, it said a version of LLaMA with 13 billion parameters can outperform GPT-3, a recent predecessor to the model on which ChatGPT is built.

It described its 65-billion-parameter LLaMA model as ""competitive"" with Google's Chinchilla70B and PaLM-540B, which are even larger than the model that Google used to show off its Bard chat-powered search.

A Meta spokeswoman attributed the performance to a larger quantity of ""cleaner"" data and ""architectural improvements"" in the model that enhanced training stability.

Meta in May last year released large language model OPT-175B, also aimed at researchers, which formed the basis of a new iteration of its chatbot BlenderBot.

It later introduced a model called Galactica, which could write scientific articles and solve math problems, but quickly pulled down the demo after it generated authoritative-sounding false responses.

761,277,Microsoft,2023-02-24,China says it sees the potential of ChatGPT-like technology,"













BEIJING, Feb 24 (Reuters) - China's Ministry of Science and Technology said on Friday said it saw the potential of ChatGPT-like tech and would be pushing for the integration of artificial intelligence into Chinese society and the economy.

""(This technology) has the potential to be applied in many industries and fields,"" Chen Jiachang, who heads the ministry's high-tech department, told a news briefing, praising its natural language processing capabilities.

Minister Wang Zhigang also told the same briefing that from an ethics standpoint, technologies like ChatGPT should not be limited too much so they can be developed effectively, though he cautioned that all technological achievements have ""two sides"".

Their comments come at a time when Chinese tech companies and investors are keeping an eye on how Beijing will regulate ChatGPT-like technology.

Microsoft-backed OpenAI has kept its hit ChatGPT app off-limits to users in China but the app is attracting huge interest in the country, with firms rushing to integrate the technology into their products and launch rival solutions. read more

762,462,Microsoft,2023-02-24,"Ericsson to lay off 8,500 employees -memo","













STOCKHOLM, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Telecom equipment maker Ericsson (ERICb.ST) will lay off 8,500 employees globally as part of its plan to cut costs, a memo sent to employees and seen by Reuters said.

While technology companies such as Microsoft (MSFT.O), Meta (META.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) have laid off thousands of employees citing economic conditions, Ericsson's move would be the largest layoff to hit the telecoms industry.

""The way headcount reductions will be managed will differ depending on local country practice,"" Chief Executive Borje Ekholm wrote in the memo.

""In several countries the headcount reductions have already been communicated this week,"" he said.

On Monday, the company, which employs more than 105,000 worldwide, announced plans to cut about 1,400 jobs in Sweden.

While Ericsson did not disclose which geography would be most affected, analysts had predicted that North America would likely be most affected and growing markets such as India the least.

The company said in December it would cut costs by 9 billion crowns ($880 million) by the end of 2023 as demand slows in some markets, including North America.

""It is our obligation to take this cost out to remain competitive,"" Ekholm said in the memo. ""Our biggest enemy right now may be complacency.""

Many telecom companies had beefed up their inventories during the height of the pandemic which is now leading to slowing orders for telecom equipment makers.

Verizon (VZ.N), one of the largest telecom companies, plans to spend between $18.25 billion and $19.25 billion this year, down from a capital expenditure budget of $23 billion last year.

Ericsson Chief Financial Officer Carl Mellander had earlier told Reuters that cost cuts would involve reducing consultants, real estate and employee headcount.

Nordic rival Nokia (NOKIA.HE) has not announced any plans to lay off employees.

Feb 24 (Reuters) - A Colombian court this month hosted its first legal trial in the metaverse, and now hopes to experiment again with virtual reality, authorities told Reuters.

At the two-hour hearing held by Colombia's Magdalena Administrative court, participants in a traffic dispute appeared as avatars in a virtual courtroom. Magistrate Maria Quinones Triana's avatar dressed in black legal robes.

The country is among the earliest worldwide to test real legal hearings in the metaverse, immersive virtual reality to make digital spaces feel more lifelike, often with avatars representing each participant.

""It felt more real than a video call,"" Quiones told Reuters on Friday, describing the metaverse experience as ""amazing."" On Zoom, she noted, ""Many people turn off their cameras, you have no idea what they're doing,""

The case - brought by a regional transport union against the police - will now proceed partly in the metaverse, potentially including the verdict, Quiones said. She did not rule out metaverse hearings elsewhere.

""This is an academic experiment to show that there it's possible... but where everyone consents to it, (my court) can continue to do things in the metaverse,"" she added.

While legal trials have increasingly moved to video meetings hosted by Zoom and Google, few have experimented with the metaverse, a space that Meta (META.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and other tech giants are racing to build.

Early examples of interviews and meetings in the metaverse have been mocked for often-clunky, cartoonish visualizations.

Nonetheless, Colombia's court proceedings on Feb 15 - streamed to Youtube - went off without too much of a glitch, bar some dizzying camera movement and some distorted movements.

Quiones reiterated the constitutional legitimacy of the virtual tribunal, but acknowledged that the experiment had not been popular, citing 70% disapproval among viewers.

Juan David Gutierrez, a public policy professor at Colombia's University of Rosario, said use of the metaverse in legal proceedings has a long way to go.

""You need a hardware to do this that very few people have. And that prompts questions about accessibility to justice and equality,"" he told Reuters.

Quiones agreed that costs and accessibility needed to be discussed. But she advocated for the metaverse in cases of abuse for example, where participants can share a space without having to physically see each other.

Gutierrez said judges in Colombia were chasing ways to alleviate the country's overloaded justice system.

""We create this illusion that technology is going to make things more efficient, but sometimes, it's the opposite.""

764,175,Microsoft,2023-02-27,Snap to roll out chatbot powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT,"













Feb 27 (Reuters) - Snap Inc (SNAP.N), which owns photo messaging app Snapchat, said on Monday it is rolling out an artificial intelligence chatbot powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT technology, as the company seeks to enter the buzzy field of generative AI.

The chatbot, called My AI, will be available to subscribers of Snap's premium subscription Snapchat+, the company said in a blog post.

ChatGPT, which can generate prose in response to prompts, has captivated the tech industry. Microsoft and Alphabet's Google both announced their own AI chatbots earlier in February.

My AI was trained to have a fun and lighthearted tone and will be able to offer creative ideas like potential gifts for a friend's birthday or write a poem about a certain topic, Snap said.

The Santa Monica, California-based company said in the blog post that the chatbot is ""prone to hallucination,"" and may be tricked into saying anything, adding that users should not rely on the bot for advice.

While AI-powered chatbots are a nascent field, early search results and conversations have made headlines with its unpredictability.

Alphabet lost $100 billion in market value earlier this month when its new chatbot shared inaccurate information in a promotional video.

765,619,Microsoft,2023-02-27,Open-source software braces for trade war,"













HONG KONG, Feb 27 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The open-source software movement has been an unprecedented driver of global innovation and productivity growth. By sharing code that runs databases, smartphones and designs semiconductors for free – and letting anyone contribute to upgrading it and patching its bugs – OSS, as it is known, has spared companies from the need to reinvent countless wheels, accelerating the growth of the $475 billion global software industry. Yet rising geopolitical tensions are putting the movement’s future economic contribution at risk.

As with other parts of the supply chain, Chinese and American code bases are quietly but deeply intertwined. China is the second-largest contributor to GitHub, a shared repository which Microsoft (MSFT.O) bought in 2018 for $7.5 billion. Nearly all Chinese smartphone manufacturers use versions of Android, an OSS operating system which generated $22 billion in profit for Google from its launch in 2007 through early 2016, according to an estimate revealed by a lawyer for Oracle that year. Google's owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) does not break out Android revenues generated by advertising and app downloads from its store.

Originally more takers than sharers, mainland tech giants like Alibaba (9988.HK), and Tencent (0700.HK) now contribute generously to OSS projects overseas; China Inc has also shared frameworks for AI development, including search engine Baidu’s (9888.HK) PaddlePaddle and image recognition specialist Megvii’s MegEngine.

There are two big issues. First is security. As Western democracies use open-source code to accelerate strategic industries like artificial intelligence and semiconductor chip design, they also gift it to Beijing at a moment when Western AI is being deployed on the frigid battlefields of Ukraine, and the People’s Republic may be mulling military aid to Russia.

The second problem is moral. Chinese developers participating in international OSS machine-learning projects often contribute “model weights”: mathematical formulations that neural networks learn from training on China’s massive and opaquely sourced domestic data reservoir. The most impressive AI models require billions of examples from which to learn model weights and require large upfront investments, so companies generally welcome Chinese contributions. But software industry insiders told Breakingviews they are worried that these weights could be derived from data collected from sources like government surveillance cameras, some of which are allegedly trained to watch for ethnic minorities by companies like Megvii.

The United States fired a warning shot at telecoms giant Huawei in 2019. As with most Chinese handset makers, founder Ren Zhengfei relied on Android’s open-source code to run his company’s smartphones. But President Donald Trump’s administration put the company on a blacklist that effectively prevented it from using the Google services that complemented Android, in particular its app store.

The move crippled Huawei’s overseas smartphone businesses and telegraphed to China’s tech sector that the American government was willing and able to weaponise OSS. The same year, GitHub began blocking developers in Iran, Syria and Crimea. Today OpenAI, the somewhat misleadingly named Microsoft-backed company behind the popular ChatGPT bot, won’t allow residents of China and Russia to create accounts to use the tool. Beijing has reciprocated, per a Nikkei report, by instructing its own tech companies not to incorporate ChatGPT into their platforms - a rare example of a mutual firewall.

Huawei has since built its own OSS operating system called Harmony, and GitHub now faces a Chinese rival startup called Gitee, which enjoys backing from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. On nearly every front, China is moving to duplicate OSS functions, including chatbots, and building communities it can control. Chinese developers are already complaining about censorship on Gitee.

“The United States government is much more comfortable going after companies than software because [the latter] is a lot harder conceptually for U.S. agencies,” notes China risk consultant Isaac Stone Fish. Blocking Chinese access to OSS libraries would be legally complex, given the code has been donated to the global commons. It would be technologically tricky too given the pervasiveness of virtual private networks that conceal where a user is visiting from. Also, nothing stops a Chinese intelligence officer from downloading OSS resources while abroad. And yet given fraying relations, it seems inevitable that Western democracies will start making it harder for China to take free code; they might also simply produce less of it. Washington has already selectively blocked access to U.S. government websites in China.

Severing the intellectual link between the world’s two largest open-source communities, the United States and China, would be profound. One study in 2018 estimated that OSS adoption generated up to €95 billion of “positive impact” in the European Union and predicted that a 10% uptake in code contributions from the global tech community could generate an additional 0.6% of regional GDP.

Dividing the world into competing open-source camps would mark another reverse for free trade. It would also be a sad endorsement of the old adage that nothing is truly free.

766,588,Microsoft,2023-02-27,EU industry chief Breton says not favouring Big Telecoms over Big Tech,"













BRUSSELS, Feb 27 (Reuters) - EU industry chief Thierry Breton on Monday defended a consultation on whether Big Tech should foot the bill for billions of euros of investments in Europe's telecoms infrastructure, saying it was not about putting Big Telecoms' interests above tech companies.

The consultation launched last week pits Deutsche Telekom AG (DTEGn.DE), Orange SA (ORAN.PA), Telefonica SA (TEF.MC), Telecom Italia SpA (TLIT.MI) against Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

The European Union official said he did not see the issue as ""a binary choice between those who provide networks today and those who feed them with the traffic"".

""For me the real challenge is to make sure that by 2030 our fellow citizens and business on our streets across the EU – including here in Barcelona – have access to fast, reliable and data-intense Gigabit connectivity,"" Breton said in the text of a speech to be delivered at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in the Spanish city.

""And for that we need the connectivity networks – highways – of the future. That is the vision. It is not about whether one vested interest should prevail over another,"" he said.

The Dutch government on Monday warned against imposing an internet toll on tech companies, the first EU government to criticise Breton's plan after its Thursday launch, saying such a move may breach net neutrality rules and lead to price hikes for Europeans.

Still, Breton took a swipe at the big U.S. tech companies with their large-scale data centres, their cloud-based radio access network (RAN) - the radio element of a cellular system - and their closed ecosystems.

""We see hyperscalers in cloud and platform services leveraging their market dominance to move into the telco space, using their cash reserves to develop Cloud RAN networks and to provide direct services to business,"" he said.

""And interoperability or openness are not currently a strong feature of their business model.""

He called for a serious discussion of possible hurdles to cross-border telecoms consolidation, siding with operators who say tough EU merger rules impede deals, and also talked up the benefits of an integrated radio spectrum market.

""I see these two issues as currently holding back our collective potential compared to other continents,"" Breton said.

BRUSSELS, Feb 27 (Reuters) - The Netherlands on Monday warned against hitting Big Tech with a so-called internet toll to help pay for billions of euros in network investments, saying such a move may breach net neutrality rules and lead to price hikes for Europeans.

The comments by Dutch Economic Affairs Minister Micky Adriaansens marked the first by an EU country after EU industry chief Thierry Breton kicked off a consultation last Thursday on who should foot the bill to roll out costly 5G and broadband.

Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), Orange (ORAN.PA), Telefonica (TEF.MC), Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) and other operators have long lobbied for a Big Tech contribution and have found an ally in Breton, a former chief executive at Orange.

Among the companies that said an internet tax would undermine EU rules to treat all users equally are Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). These companies account for more than half of data internet traffic, according to telecom operators.

Adriaansens said the Dutch government had commissioned a study by economic consultancy Oxera which showed the drawbacks of such a tax.

""It will penalise the consumers,"" she told Reuters in an interview, saying that consumers who pay subscription fees to telecoms providers and also subscribe to streaming and video services may see the latter fees go up with Big Tech likely to pass on the internet tax.

""We should analyse the problem first and what the normal market reaction is to these challenges. The first one is the government in place to facilitate or are there other funds available or is it just the markets' responsibility to take care of this infrastructure?"" Adriaansens said.

""I think that there is this concern that our infrastructure is not able to meet our expectations and our ambitions. So I understand that concern but I don't think that this is the way to go then, so fast,"" she said.

According to Oxera's study, Europe's telecoms providers have not been burdened with higher network costs despite the strong growth in internet data traffic. Oxera also found that these companies' operating profits have been boosted by network modernisation which has led to fewer employees and lower capital costs.

""Our analysis of the proposals for a levy shows that such a policy cannot robustly be shown to increase economic efficiency, and would potentially bring substantial transaction and set-up costs,"" the report said.

768,548,Microsoft,2023-02-27,Exclusive: Broadcom faces EU antitrust warning on $61 bln VMware deal - sources,"













BRUSSELS, Feb 27 (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O) is set to receive a European Union antitrust warning about the possible anti-competitive effects of its proposed $61 billion bid for cloud computing company VMware (VMW.N) in the coming weeks, people familiar with the matter said.

The European Commission opened an investigation in December, saying the deal, announced last year, would allow Broadcom to restrict competition in the market for certain hardware components which interoperate with VMware's software.

The EU competition enforcer, which will decide on the deal by June 7, declined to comment.

Tech M&A deals have attracted more intense scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic recently as regulators worry about giant companies acquiring smaller, more innovative rivals.

The Commission will set out its concerns in a statement of objections, the people said. Companies can subsequently ask for a closed hearing to defend their deals in front of senior Commission and national competition officials as well as rivals and the Commission's lawyers.

Broadcom is expected to offer remedies only after receiving the EU charge sheet and not before that, with no asset sale foreseen, one of the sources said.

[1/2] The Broadcom Limited company logo is shown outside one of their office complexes in Irvine, California, U.S., March 4, 2021. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo 1 2

Broadcom said it would continue its ""constructive work"" with the Commission. The deal has received the green light in Brazil, South Africa and Canada, while the UK competition watchdog is investigating the acquisition.

""We continue to expect the transaction will close in Broadcom's fiscal year 2023,"" the company said.

The two companies received a ""second request"" for information about their deal from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in July, indicating that the planned transaction would be closely scrutinized, according to a government filing.

U.S. antitrust enforcers have sought to stop an unusually large number of deals during the Biden administration because of concerns over concentration in the U.S. economy.

Broadcom has told the EU enforcer that the presence of Amazon (AMZN.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google (GOOGL.O) shows that there is strong competition in the cloud computing market, other people familiar with the matter told Reuters in October.

Beltug, a Belgian association of CIOs & Digital Technology leaders, and its counterparts France's Cigref, CIO platform Nederland and VOICE Germany have said that the deal could lead to big price increases and tougher commercial practices against customers.

Feb 27 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) is creating a new top-level product group focused on generative artificial intelligence (AI), Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Monday, as the AI race among Big Tech firms heats up.

AI has emerged as a bright spot for investments in the tech industry, which has been struggling with slowing growth, and has cut thousands of jobs, as well as dialed down on experimental bets to beat the downturn.

""We're starting by pulling together a lot of the teams working on generative AI across the company into one group focused on building delightful experiences around this technology,"" Zuckerberg said in an Instagram post.

""Over the longer term, we'll focus on developing AI personas that can help people in a variety of ways,"" Zuckerberg said, but for now ""we're exploring experiences with text (chat in WhatsApp and Messenger), with images (creative Instagram filters and ad formats), and with video and multi-modal experiences.""

Ahmad Al-Dahle will lead the new product team, which will report to Chris Cox, Meta's chief product officer, a company spokesperson confirmed. This will enable Meta to more rapidly implement the AI research team's findings in Meta's products, the spokesperson said.

The public battle to dominate the AI technology space kicked off late last year with the launch of Microsoft-backed (MSFT.O) OpenAI's ChatGPT, which has since prompted tech heavyweights from Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) to China's Baidu Inc (9888.HK), to announce their own offerings.

Last week, Facebook-parent Meta said it was releasing a new large language model LLaMA, the core software of a new AI system, which would be available under non-commercial license to researchers and entities affiliated with government, civil society and academia.

Shares of Meta Platforms closed down 0.5% on Monday.

770,369,Microsoft,2023-02-27,China's Tencent establishes team to develop ChatGPT-like product -sources,"













HONG KONG, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) has set up a development team to work on a ChatGPT-like chatbot, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

ChatGPT's uncanny ability to create cogent blocks of text instantly has sparked worldwide frenzied interest in the technology behind it called generative AI.

Although Microsoft-backed OpenAI does not allow users in China to create accounts to access the chatbot, the open AI models behind the programme are relatively accessible and are increasingly being incorporated into Chinese consumer technology applications.

A number of Tencent rivals including Alibaba Group (9988.HK) and Baidu Inc (9888.HK) have also announced they are working on their own offerings.

Tencent's product, to be called ""HunyuanAide"", will incorporate the company's AI training model named ""Hunyuan"", said the people who were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.

Asked for comment, Tencent reiterated a Feb.9 statement that it is conducting research on ChatGPT-tool technology.

The news comes after China's Ministry of Science and Technology said on Friday it saw the potential of ChatGPT-like tech and would be pushing for the integration of artificial intelligence into Chinese society and the economy.

According to the South China Morning Post, Tencent's Hunyuan AI model in November achieved a record-high score on the Chinese Language Understanding Evaluation (CLUE) test - a set of tasks used to assess a computer's ability to understand and respond to Chinese text.

That also marked the first time an AI model has scored better than humans on CLUE since the test was established three years ago.

Local media outlet 36kr first reported the establishment of the ""HunyuanAide"" team.

771,215,Microsoft,2023-02-27,"Zoom jumps on AI bandwagon, forecasts upbeat 2024 profit targets","













Feb 27 (Reuters) - Zoom Video Communications Inc (ZM.O) said on Monday it will integrate more artificial intelligence into its products and forecast annual profit above Wall Street estimates, sending the company's shares up 8% in extended trading.

Analysts predict the AI tech will be a major driver for future growth for the tech industry, which has been grappling with slowing demand amid recessionary fears.

The AI race picked up pace after Microsoft-backed (MSFT.O) OpenAI's ChatGPT last year prompted heavyweights from Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) to China's Baidu Inc (9888.HK) to announce their own offerings.

""I like that Zoom is proactively talking about these opportunities today and I honestly believe it's necessary, especially given Microsoft is already including ChatGPT as part of Teams Premium,"" said RBC analyst Rishi Jaluria.

San Jose, California-based Zoom forecast fiscal 2024 profit between $4.11 and $4.18 per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of $3.66 per share, according to Refinitiv data.

""The age of AI and large language models has arrived,"" said Chief Executive Eric Yuan during a call with analysts, adding that AI can ""truly help"" the company.

Zoom is also benefiting from steady demand for its video-conferencing service from the ongoing shift to hybrid work models and cost cuts. Earlier this month, it announced an about 15% reduction in its workforce.

On an adjusted basis, Zoom earned $1.22 per share for the fourth quarter ended Jan. 31, compared with estimates of 81 cents per share.

Revenue grew 4% to $1.12 billion, above analysts' average expectation of $1.10 billion.

Finance chief Kelly Steckelberg said the growth was primarily driven by strength in Zoom's enterprise business.

The company, however, expects 2024 revenue between $4.44 billion and $4.46 billion, below average Street estimate of $4.60 billion.

""The revenue outlook is softer than initially expected, partly due to macro pressures and especially given declining online business,"" Jaluria said.

772,110,Microsoft,2023-02-28,Microsoft adds new Bing to Windows computers in effort to roll out AI,"













Feb 28 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Tuesday started adding its recently upgraded Bing search engine to its Windows computer software, aiming to put artificial intelligence (AI) at the fingertips of hundreds of millions of people.

The Windows 11 update, Microsoft's latest in a flurry of product revamps this month, shows how the Redmond, Washington-based software maker is marching ahead on AI notwithstanding recent scrutiny of its technology.

Microsoft's operating system will include the new Bing in desktop computers' search box, which helps half a billion monthly users navigate their files and the internet, the company said. The search engine itself is still in a preview mode, accessible to more than 1 million people in 169 countries with a wait list for others, Microsoft said.

The company unveiled its AI-powered chatbot for Bing as it aims to wrest market share from Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, moving faster with ChatGPT-like software for search.

Microsoft has been gathering feedback on the new Bing before a wider rollout. The engine's AI chatbot reportedly professed love or made threats to some testers, leading the company to cap long chats it said ""provoked"" responses it did not intend.

In addition to the new Bing, Microsoft's Windows update will include software that can connect to iPhone messages and calls starting with a limited set of users, the company said.

773,600,Microsoft,2023-03-01,Elliott nominates slate of directors to Salesforce board - source,"













March 1 (Reuters) - Activist investor Elliott Management Corp has nominated a slate of directors to the board of cloud-based software provider Salesforce Inc (CRM.N), a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

The source declined to name Elliott's director candidates or say how many there were.

Elliott said it has been in substantive dialogue with Salesforce leading up to its earnings statement, and ""today's announcements represent progress towards regaining investor trust"".

""The acceleration of margin targets, commitment to responsible capital-return priorities, creation of a business transformation committee and disbanding of the M&A committee are necessary steps forward,"" Elliot said in a statement without making any reference to board nominations.

The steps are consistent with our recommendations, the activist investor said, adding that they will help restore value at Salesforce.

The software provider forecast its first-quarter revenue above analysts' estimates and doubled its share repurchase to $20 billion, indicating a strong cash flow.

Elliott also took an aim at Salesforce's leadership, stating that it required a sustainable plan and a board that would provide accountability through proper oversight.

""To fully earn back the confidence and support of investors, Salesforce leadership must now deliver on its promises.""

The hedge fund said it intends to continue working with Salesforce as they evaluate the ""level of engagement necessary to achieve the best outcome for the company"".

Elliott became the latest activist investor to establish a position in Salesforce when it unveiled its multi-billion dollar stake in January.

Other hedge funds with stakes include Jeff Ubben's Inclusive Capital Partners, Jeff Smith's Starboard Value, ValueAct Capital and Third Point.

Some activists have pushed for the company to increase growth and margins, buy back more shares, and raised concerns about recent acquisitions.

Salesforce could not be reached for comment.

News of the nominations was first reported by CNBC.

To address some of its issues, the company had been working for months to refresh its board and earlier this year added three new directors. These include ValueAct Capital's Chief Executive and Chief Investment Officer Mason Morfit, Mastercard (MA.N) finance chief Sachin Mehra, and former Carnival Corp (CCL.N) CEO Arnold Donald.

Morfit helped to boost Microsoft's market value when he served on the board from 2014 to 2017.

The slate nominated by Elliott signals the pressure such an investor can bring to bear on its target, analysts said, noting that many are using this tool more frequently.

Salesforce, valued at $164 billion, said in January it planned to cut a tenth of its jobs and close some offices after rapid pandemic hiring left it with a bloated workforce.

Tech companies have shed more than 150,000 workers in 2022. Other technology giants such as Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) have also announced job cuts in recent months.

774,488,Microsoft,2023-03-01,Activision fired staff for using 'strong language' about remote work policy -union,"













March 1 (Reuters) - ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) has been accused by a union of illegally firing two video game testers for using ""strong language"" in a protest of a new company policy that limits remote work.

The Communication Workers of America (CWA) said it filed a complaint with the U.S. National Labor Relations Board on Tuesday seeking to have the workers reinstated.

The case is the latest the union has brought to the labor board as part of a campaign to unionize the firm and its subsidiaries. Small groups of game testers at three Activision subsidiaries voted to join the CWA last year.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is seeking to acquire Activision for $69 billion, but U.S. regulators have sued to block the deal.

The labor board last year issued complaints accusing Santa Monica, California-based Activision of threatening employees who posted on social media about their working conditions and withholding raises from pro-union workers, which the company denies.

Joseph Christinat, a spokesman for Activision, said the company takes appropriate disciplinary action when employees violate its workplace code of conduct.

“Using abusive, threatening or harassing language toward colleagues is unacceptable and we are disappointed that the CWA is advocating for this type of behavior,” he said.

According to the union, Activision last month announced its employees would be required to report to the office three days per week beginning in April, ending a policy that had allowed more flexible arrangements during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The change received an overwhelmingly negative response from employees, the CWA said, and Activision fired two game testers who ""expressed their outrage using strong language.""

The CWA suggested the Democrat-led labor board could use the case to revisit a 2020 ruling by a Republican majority that limited legal protections for workers who use vulgar or offensive language during workplace disputes.

""When faced with unfair treatment by unscrupulous employers like Activision, workers should have the right to express themselves,"" CWA Secretary-Treasurer Sara Steffens said in a statement.

776,346,Microsoft,2023-03-02,Apple blocks update to email app with ChatGPT tech,"













March 2 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has blocked an update to email app BlueMail, which uses a customized version of OpenAI's GPT-3 language model, the co-founder of the app developer told Reuters on Thursday.

""Apple has blocked the BlueMail update and continues to treat BlueMail unfairly and to discriminate against us,"" Blix's Ben Volach said.

""Other GPT-powered apps seem not to be restricted,"" he added.

Apple, which rejected the app update last week, asked the company to revise the app's age rating for those over 17 or implement content filtering, as BlueMail may produce content not appropriate for all audiences, according to a document viewed by Reuters.

""We want fair­ness. If we're re­quired to be 17-plus, then oth­ers should also have to,"" Volach tweeted, adding that many other apps that advertise ChatGPT-like features listed on Apple's app store do not have age restrictions.

Apple, which was looking into the complaint, said developers have the option to challenge a rejection through the App Review Board process.

""It suggests to us that the company may scrutinize apps with ChatGPT functionality in the same way it does others where there are concerns about the quality of the user experience and appropriate nature of the content or service provided by the app,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Thomas Forte said.

OpenAI's ChatGPT, which can generate content in response to user prompts, has captivated the tech industry.

Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google both announced their own AI chatbots earlier in February.

While AI-powered chatbots are a nascent field, early search results and conversations have made headlines with their unpredictability.

777,7,Microsoft,2023-03-02,Microsoft Africa internet plan moves forward with fiber deal,"













March 2 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has reached a deal with Africa's biggest independent fiber network toward its goal of expanding internet access on the continent, its President Brad Smith said.

The agreement, with Liquid Intelligent Technologies, by 2025 aims to widen connectivity in countries such as Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to 20 million people, out of Microsoft's previously announced 100 million target.

""Our goal here is to use digital technology and investment as a catalyst to create more economic opportunity for the population,"" Smith told Reuters on Tuesday ahead of next week's U.N. conference on the least developed countries.

The effort aims to build a new cloud-computing and AI market longer-term, which would benefit Microsoft, Smith has said.

The software maker's so-called Airband initiative brings together telecoms and electricity providers, non-profits and governments to increase internet access.

Smith also said Microsoft would work to improve food production in Africa through various partnerships, including applying artificial intelligence to monitor crops.

778,83,Microsoft,2023-03-02,"Exclusive: Microsoft set to win EU nod on Activision with licensing offer, sources say","













BRUSSELS, March 2 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is expected to secure EU antitrust approval for its $69 billion acquisition of Activision (ATVI.O) with its offer of licensing deals to rivals, three people familiar with the matter said, helping it to clear a major hurdle.

Microsoft announced the Activision bid in January last year, its biggest ever, to take on leaders Tencent (0700.HK) and Sony (6758.T), in the booming videogaming market and to venture in the metaverse which is virtual online worlds where people can work, play and socialise.

The European Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by April 25, is not expected to demand that Microsoft sell assets to win its approval, the people said.

In addition to the licensing deals for rivals, Microsoft may also have to offer other behavioural remedies to allay concerns of other parties than Sony, one of the people said. Such remedies typically refer to the future conduct of the merged company.

Activision shares, which jumped 1.8% in pre-market trading after the Reuters' story was published, were up 2.6% in late trade.

Microsoft President Brad Smith last month said the U.S. software group was ready to offer rivals licensing deals to address antitrust concerns but it would not sell Activision's lucrative ""Call of Duty"" franchise.

Smith said it was not feasible or realistic to think that one game or one slice of Activision can be carved out and separated from the rest.

The EU competition enforcer declined to comment.

Microsoft said it was ""committed to offering effective and easily enforceable solutions that address the European Commission's concerns.""

""Our commitment to grant long term 100% equal access to Call of Duty to Sony, Steam, NVIDIA and others preserves the deal's benefits to gamers and developers and increases competition in the market,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said.

Last month, Microsoft said it had signed 10-year licensing deals with Nintendo (7974.T) and Nvidia (NVDA.O) that will bring Call of Duty to their gaming platforms, with the agreements conditional on a green light for the Activision deal.

The deal faces regulatory headwinds in Britain, where the UK competition agency has suggested that Microsoft divests Call of Duty to address its concerns while the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has asked a judge to block the deal.

779,538,Microsoft,2023-03-02,Musk: 'AI stresses me out',"













DETROIT, March 1 (Reuters) - Elon Musk has clashed often with securities regulators and highway safety authorities, but there's one area the Tesla and Twitter chief says the government should regulate now: Artificial Intelligence.

""AI stresses me out,"" Musk said near the end of a more than three-hour presentation to Tesla investors about company plans.

Tesla's own ambitious artificial intelligence efforts had a featured role in the presentation of Musk's ""Master Plan 3"", the third part of a series of papers on how to expand Tesla and convert the world to clean energy.

There was a video of a Optimus humanoid robot, being developed by Tesla, manipulating parts of other Optimus robots as if it intended to assemble replicas of itself. Executives gave detailed presentations about how Tesla is using artificial intelligence technology to train vehicles to drive themselves - an effort under scrutiny by federal and state authorities.

But when asked by an analyst if AI could help Tesla build cars, Musk took a less optimistic line.

""I don't see AI helping us make cars any time soon,"" he said. ""At that point ... there's no point in any of us working.""

Earlier this week, Musk appeared to confirm via Twitter reports that he is recruiting a team of AI technologists to build a competitor to OpenAI's text-based ChatGPT, backed by Microsoft Corp, (MSFT.O) and similar systems under development at Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and other large technology platforms.

Musk tweeted last December that ChatGPT, a text-based chatbot developed by OpenAI that can draft prose, poetry or even computer code on command, ""is scary good. We are not far from dangerously strong AI."" He amplified those concerns for the audience of Tesla analysts Wednesday.

""I'm a little worried about the AI stuff,"" Musk said from a stage where he was flanked by 16 Tesla executives, including Autopilot head.

""We need some kind of, like, regulatory authority or something overseeing AI development,"" Musk said. ""Make sure it's operating in the public interest. It's quite dangerous technology. I fear I may have done some things to accelerate it.""

Tesla's effort to enable its cars to drive themselves safely is ""obviously useful"" AI, Musk said.

""I don't know. Tesla is doing good things in AI,"" he said. Musk paused, then sighed. ""This one stresses me out. I don't know what to say about it.""

780,317,Microsoft,2023-03-02,EU's Vestager says scrutiny of competition in metaverse already needed,"













BRUSSELS, March 2 (Reuters) - The metaverse, shared virtual worlds accessible via the Internet, is the next digital market to attract regulatory scrutiny, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Thursday.

The metaverse has come into sharper focus since Facebook changed its name to Meta Platforms (META.O) two years ago to reflect its bet on the new sector as the successor to the mobile internet.

That move has in turn triggered concerns about Meta's possible dominance. Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google and Microsoft (MSFT.O) are also active in generative artificial intelligence that the industry sees as the new bright spot.

""It's already time for us to start asking what healthy competition would look like in the metaverse,"" Vestager said a conference organised by Keystone Strategy.

Vestager asked whether it would change the equation when there are competing digital realities and language AI models like ChatGPT.

""Do we need to do more on something new? And obviously we have started that work,"" she said.

She said regulatory scrutiny of digital markets has been escalating worldwide in the last three years.

""And there's a much wider political debate that digital markets need careful attention. I think all jurisdictions are moving forward in one form or another,"" Vestager said.

She said some antitrust enforcers were more advanced than others.

""We are moving at different speeds. We will not get the same legal framework. And maybe that is not a bad thing. Because that will allow us to hone our toolkits in the process of mutual learning,"" Vestager said.

781,679,Microsoft,2023-03-02,LSE Group targets Blackstone/Thomson Reuters stake buyback as raises outlook,"













LONDON, March 2 (Reuters) - London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG.L) announced plans to buy back more of its shares on Thursday as it raised its income growth outlook and highlighted its successful integration of Refinitiv, saying this had supercharged its ability to generate cash.

LSEG said it would seek shareholder consent to buy more of its own stock from a consortium of Blackstone (BX.N) and Thomson Reuters (TRI.TO) from which it acquired data analytics group Refinitiv for $27 billion in January 2021.

""In addition to our existing share buyback, we are today announcing plans to seek shareholder approval for a buyback directed towards the Blackstone/Thomson Reuters consortium's stake, which will benefit all shareholders,"" LSEG Chief Executive David Schwimmer said in a statement.

The Refinitiv deal transformed LSEG, with data and analytics accounting for 4.944 billion pounds ($5.9 billion) of its total income of 7.743 billion pounds in 2022, eclipsing the sums earned by its traditional exchange activities, including share trading, which go back more than 300 years.

""We are accelerating delivery of our cost synergies and increasing our revenue synergy targets,"" Schwimmer said.

The directed buyback is expected to be up to 750 million pounds by April 2024, LSEG said.

Thomson Reuters, the parent company of Reuters News, and Blackstone did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Schwimmer said the consortium owned just over 30% of LSEG shares when the Refinitiv deal was completed. Thomson Reuters, owned about $5.6 billion worth of LSEG shares as of Jan 31.

About 10% of LSEG equity is available for sale by the consortium.

LSEG said 300 million pounds of a separate, broader 750 million pound share buyback was carried out in 2022, with the remainder to be completed by July 2023.

""We see the result as strong enough to keep sentiment for LSEG intact ahead of any potential share disposals over the coming months,"" RBC Europe said in a note to clients.

Shares in LSEG, which released preliminary 2022 results in-line with forecasts, traded 2.6% lower.

TARGETS

LSEG's total income, including recoveries, of 7.743 billion pounds in 2022, was just above analysts' consensus of 7.733 billion pounds, and up from 6.535 billion in 2021.

It raised its guidance on revenue synergies from 225 million pounds by 2025 to 350-400 million pounds.

Chief Financial Officer Anna Manz said targets linked to the Refinitiv takeover would expire in December and she would share her 'thinking' later this year on what comes next.

""Right now we are very focused on making sure we absolutely knock those acquisition targets out of the park,"" Manz said.

Schwimmer said the integration of Refinitiv and a strategic $2 billion partnership announced with Microsoft in December meant LSEG is ""shifting from integration to transformation"".

""We generate a lot of cash,"" he told reporters.

Britain is seeking to persuade Softbank-owned UK chip technology company Arm to have a listing in London. The UK has also launched a raft of capital market reforms aimed at helping to close the listings gap with New York.

Schwimmer declined to comment on whether he expected Arm to have a London listing.

""We continue to be very excited about the prospects for this market, it continues the most international capital market and there is a real opportunity to continue to improve it,"" Schwimmer said.

He was also optimistic that LSEG's clearing arm in London will not be cut off from the European Union when existing EU market access is due to expire in June 2025.

Britain's Financial Conduct Authority on Thursday said competition in some parts of the wholesale data market, which includes prices and volumes traded on exchanges, is not working as well as it should, and it was launching a market study.

""It's an important part of our business, a very competitive market for data on a global basis, so not a concern there,"" Schwimmer said.

March 3 (Reuters) - Shares of artificial intelligence-based (AI) product makers zoomed on Friday, as a strong forecast from retail darling C3.ai Inc (AI.N) amplified an ongoing euphoria in the segment driven by the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT.

C3.a1 forecast better-than-expected revenue and profit for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023, after its third-quarter results topped Wall Street estimates.

Shares of the AI software provider were up 16% at $24.80, and were one of the top five trending stocks on StockTwits. If the gains hold, the stock is set to notch its strongest one-day gain in a month.

""The company is starting to gain momentum in building significant enterprise opportunities in its pipeline with its suite of innovative enterprise AI solutions,"" said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives.

The firm's aim to turn cash positive and adjusted profitable by the end of fiscal year 2024 also boosted the stock, but Ives believes the execution of these ambitions is key to regain the Street's confidence heading into 2023.

Retail investors have flocked to small-cap firms building AI tools as companies such as Google-parent Alphabet Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) have locked horns to make AI the next big growth driver.

Microsoft's investment in OpenAI's ChatGPT boosted AI firms' popularity further. Chatbots like the ChatGPT are software applications that aim to mimic human conversation using artificial intelligence.

Other major AI stocks also surged on Friday with BigBear.ai (BBAI.N), conversation intelligence firm SoundHound AI (SOUN.O), and Thailand's security firm Guardforce AI (GFAI.O) jumping between 5% and 20%.

So far this year, these stocks, including C3.ai, have surged 33.9%-321.6%, as of the previous day's close.

""AI could become the new gold rush on Wall Street,"" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of 50 Park Investments in Florida.

""But it still needs some more time to mature a bit, better price action, and prove that it can generate profits for investors.""

783,311,Microsoft,2023-03-03,OpenAI's long-time backer Reid Hoffman leaves board,"













March 3 (Reuters) - LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman is leaving OpenAI's board to avoid conflicts of interest as he backs more artificial intelligence companies, he said in an online post.

Hoffman, who has invested in and advised the startup since its 2015 founding, said his venture capital firm Greylock is funding companies such as presentation generator Tome, which are paying for tools from OpenAI, the creator of chatbot sensation ChatGPT. Hoffman also co-founded Inflection AI, one of the highest profile startups working on technology similar to OpenAI's.

""By stepping off the board, I can proactively put to rest any downstream potential issues for both OpenAI and all Greylock portfolio companies I’ve backed,"" he said, noting OpenAI has avoided conflicts to date.

Hoffman's departure underscores competition among an increasing number companies aiming to reshape content production as well as entire industries through AI.

At the same time, Hoffman said he remained OpenAI's ""ally"" and wanted to work toward ""elevating humanity"" through technology including cross-industry partnerships if desired.

Sam Altman, OpenAI's chief executive, said in a Twitter post responding to Hoffman that he looks forward ""to much more collaboration in the future!""

Hoffman remains on the board of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), itself a major partner to and investor in OpenAI.

784,502,Microsoft,2023-03-03,Morning Bid: Fed's 'slow and steady' lifts market mood,"













A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Ankur Banerjee

All it took was a bit of a hint that the Federal Reserve may stick to its moderate monetary tightening path for the market to attempt a risk-on rally to end the week. Futures indicate that the buoyant mood is set to continue in Europe, with the continent-wide STOXX 600 looking to end yet another week with gains. The index has so far this year registered just three weeks of losses.

While Fed officials wrestled on Thursday with whether a recent string of resilient economic data was a ""blip"" or a sign that even higher interest rates could be required to slow price rises. Markets took their cues from comments from Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic.

""Slow and steady is going to be the appropriate course of action,"" he said, arguing for quarter point hikes.

And so, the dollar eased and was on track to clock its first weekly loss since January, while the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index was set to snap its fourth weekly losing run.

Also helping lift sentiment was services sector data from China, reviving the optimism that a robust recovery was well underway. The Caixin/S&P Global services purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose at the fastest pace in six months to 55.0 in February from 52.9 in January.

Investors will be keenly focused on China's annual parliament session on Sunday when Beijing will set its economic goals for the year.

But before that, focus swings to the U.S. services ISM for February, scheduled to be released later on Friday.

Meanwhile, data showed core consumer inflation in Japan's capital Tokyo slowed in February, though an index stripping away the effect of fuel hit a fresh three-decade high in a sign of broadening inflationary pressures. The latest data is likely to keep the pressure on the Bank of Japan to shift away from its ultra loose monetary policy.

In the corporate world, Microsoft is expected to secure EU antitrust approval for its $69 billion acquisition of gaming firm Activision with its offer of licensing deals to rivals, Reuters reported.

785,263,Microsoft,2023-03-06,Radio company SiriusXM cuts workforce by 8%,"













March 6 (Reuters) - SiriusXM Holdings Inc (SIRI.O) on Monday said it would lay off 8% of its workforce, or about 475 employees, as the satellite radio firm takes a hit from slow subscriber growth.

In February, the owner of podcast platform Stitcher had said it expects to lose subscribers this year as consumers brace for a recession. Weak auto sales are also expected to hurt the radio operator's subscriber base. The company will also cut its marketing budget.

As on Dec. 31, 2022, SiriusXM had 5,869 full-time and part-time employees.

""Today's decision to reduce our workforce was required for us to maintain a sustainably profitable company,"" Chief executive Jennifer Witz said in a letter to staff. The lay offs will impact nearly all departments.

SiriusXM joins tech titans such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) that cut headcount by the thousands to weather a tough economy.

In January, music streaming platform Spotify Technology (SPOT.N) also cut its workforce by 6%.

786,50,Microsoft,2023-03-06,Microsoft integrates AI behind ChatGPT to more developer tools,"













March 6 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Monday bundled the technology behind ChatGPT with its Power Platform that allows users to develop applications with little or no coding, the latest integration of artificial intelligence into its products.

Big tech companies from Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) to Baidu Inc (9888.HK) are speeding up the integration of generative AI - technology that has gained popularity for its ability to generate human-like text responses to queries - into their offerings.

Microsoft said a line of business-intelligence and app-development tools within Power Platform, including Power Virtual Agent and AI Builder, was updated with the new capabilities.

Power Virtual Agent, a tool for businesses to build chatbots, can now connect to internal company resources to generate summaries of weekly reports and customer queries.

Microsoft has also added generative AI capabilities to AI Builder, which lets businesses automate workflows, and launched a new version of its business management platform Dynamics 365 based on the technology.

Dynamics 365 Copilot, the latest version of Microsoft's tool that includes a number of applications for sales, customer service and marketing, integrates AI to automate certain tasks like data gathering and analysis or creating an email campaign, among other capabilities.

Microsoft also said on Monday that Chief Executive Satya Nadella would host an event on March 16 to discuss ""reinventing productivity with AI.""

The company so far has announced AI updates for its popular Windows operating system and search engine Bing but not yet for its Office productivity suite, which includes Word and Excel.

787,761,Microsoft,2023-03-06,Stock pickers reckon it's time to move on from central banks,"













LONDON, March 6 (Reuters) - Stock market investors are calling time on the idea that the Federal Reserve, and other major central banks, have their back.

Hopes for interest rate cuts by year-end have evaporated, given resilient data and sticky inflation, suggesting central banks will instead be inclined to keep borrowing costs around their highest since 2007 for some time.

The take away for money managers? Switch from so-called growth stocks, such as tech, and focus on businesses that can withstand the end of cheap funding -- banks that benefit from higher rates and resources and consumer staples businesses that can sell goods at prices that match inflation.

Companies that pay high dividends relative to their share prices, instead of investing in growth, are also favoured.

""For years, we've had a capitalist world that was highly dependent on central-banking policy and the 'Fed put',"" said Gerry Fowler, head of European equity strategy at UBS, referring to the concept of central banks supporting financial markets any time economies turn lower.

""We are rapidly transitioning away from that.""

VALUE IS BACK

European banking stocks (.SX7E), considered a deep value investment because of relatively low price-to-earnings ratios and higher dividend yields, have jumped 24% this year.

Global equity income funds had their first annual net inflows last year since 2014, according to Morningstar data, a trend that has continued into 2023.

Shares in tech firms, which dominate world equity markets and rely on cheap money to fund innovation, had a strong start to 2023 on hopes that aggressive rate hikes would soon end as the economic cycle decelerated.

The Nasdaq (.IXIC) is still up about 12% year-to-date and a sub-index of European tech stocks has gained 15% (.SX8P). Still, these rallies lost steam from February with a build-up of strong U.S. jobs and consumer data and as euro zone inflation stayed high.

Relationship of Fed funds rate and NASDAQ stocks

ALL CHANGE

With policymakers prioritising the inflation fight and money markets pricing U.S. rates moving above 5% this year, the door on rate cuts soon has been shut.

""We probably are not getting a (central bank) pivot,"" said Janus Henderson portfolio manager Robert Schramm-Fuchs. He added that he was buying shares in companies in mature industries left behind by the easy money-enforced tech bubble, such as miners and industrial suppliers.

""We're going back to what investing used to be,"" he said. ""It is a good environment for stock-picking.""

Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at UK asset manager Premier Miton, said his funds were adding to positions in energy companies and banks, among the clear winners of the last six months.

It's a contrast to recent years. In 2020 for instance, cheap money flooded into tech and other growth stocks, with rapid growth rates forecast far into the future, as interest rates were slashed to safeguard economies from pandemic-related shutdowns.

The Nasdaq soared 44% in 2020, its biggest annual surge since 2009.

NORMALITY BACK?

Exuberant market conditions and risk taking are being replaced by the more sober activity of scanning for undervalued firms that pay decent dividends.

A Reuters poll of 300 global asset managers last month showed 70% of those surveyed believed these so-called value stocks would outperform this year.

BlackRock Investment Institute, the research arm of the world's biggest asset manager, is also tipping value shares.

MSCI's value index , containing stocks with low price-to-book value and high dividend yields, has significantly underperformed its tech stock-dominated growth index since early 2020.

This value index is dominated by energy companies viewed as benefiting from China's economic reopening, banks that profit from higher rates and health care and household products businesses that could pass cost inflation on to the consumers of these basic goods.

In Europe, recent data showed company profit margins have been increasing alongside input costs.

Reuters Graphics

""With the reopening of China and the stabilisation of the economy in Europe, that's enough for these kinds of stocks to work,"" Janus' Schramm-Fuchs said.

Another sign investors are turning towards value shares is the reduced premium they are paying for growth stocks.

The gap between the price-earnings multiple on MSCI's growth index (.dMIWO0000GNUS), dominated by Apple (AAPL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), and its value counterpart was its highest in a decade in December 2020. It has returned to pre-pandemic levels but remains elevated compared to the end of the Fed's last rate-rise cycle in early 2019.

""This convergence (between growth and value) should continue to be your base case,"" said Ryan Reardon, ETF strategist at State Street Global Advisors. ""Central banks will keep rates high.""

BRUSSELS, March 6 (Reuters) - A proposed European Union cloud security label that could exclude Amazon (AMZN.O), Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google, Microsoft (MSFT.O) and other non-EU cloud services providers from the bloc is discriminatory and could lead to retaliatory measures, a study commissioned by a tech lobbying group said.

The European Centre for International Political Economy (ECIPE) report, which was commissioned by the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), underscores growing private concerns about the draft label plan among U.S. tech giants, which have so far not made any public comment on it.

At issue is a provision in EU cybersecurity agency ENISA's certification scheme (EUCS) that requires cloud services providers to have their registered head office and global headquarters in the EU and to operate cloud services and store and process customer data in the 27-member bloc.

""I think the political intention is to squeeze out foreign suppliers but it will of course have also ramifications for EU businesses that are more or less relying on cloud computing services,"" ECIPE Director Matthias Bauer told Reuters.

""Member states should now call on the cybersecurity agency and also the European Commission to abandon politically motivated EUCS immunity requirements,"" he added.

ENISA is waiting for an opinion from EU countries, a spokesperson said and ""will then finalise the scheme by taking into utmost account this opinion and submit the final candidate scheme to the European Commission"".

The EU executive declined to comment on the ECIPE report.

""The scheme should be fully in line with EU law, as well as with the EU's international commitments, including on trade,"" a Commission spokesperson said.

ECIPE said the proposal could set a dangerous precedent for any data-intensive sector, that could see the cybersecurity label become mandatory for new technologies such as internet connected devices in energy, healthcare and autonomous driving.

A ban could also trigger retaliatory measures by EU trading partners, the think tank said.

March 7 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) will cut thousands of jobs as soon as this week in a fresh round of layoffs, Bloomberg News reported on Monday, only a few months after the Facebook-parent reduced more than 11,000 people from its workforce.

The new round of job cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the ""flattening,"" the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

Meta declined to comment on the Bloomberg report when contacted by Reuters.

Last month, the Washington Post newspaper had reported that Meta was planning to cut jobs in a reorganization and downsizing effort.

Meta, at that time, declined to comment, but spokesperson Andy Stone in a series of tweets cited several previous statements by Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg suggesting that more cuts were on the way.

Meta's mass layoffs in November that cut more than 11,000 jobs was among the biggest last year and the first in the company's history. Other tech companies, including Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), have also cut thousands of jobs.

Investment banks managing the sale of 23 million LSEG shares had orders for all the stock in the offering, according to bookrunner messages seen by Reuters after close of markets on Tuesday.

The transaction follows the publication of LSEG's 2022 earnings last week, which showed an increase in total income to 7.74 billion pounds from 6.54 billion pounds the year prior, beating analysts expectations.

Separately, the bourse operator plans to buy back up to 750 million pounds of stock from the Blackstone-Thomson Reuters consortium by April 2024.

U.S. technology giant Microsoft (MSFT.O) previously agreed to purchase a 4% stake from the consortium as part of a wider strategic partnership with LSEG in December.

Blackstone and Thomson Reuters have been shareholders in LSEG since they sold financial data provider Refinitiv to the UK group in 2021, in a landmark deal valued at $27 billion.

Following the latest stake sale, the consortium will not be able to offload any further shares for a 90-day period, according to a bank term sheet.

Barclays, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are joint global coordinators on the transaction, with Blackstone's own capital markets unit acting as co-lead manager.

791,296,Microsoft,2023-03-07,Salesforce to add ChatGPT to Slack as part of OpenAI partnership,"













March 7 (Reuters) - Salesforce Inc (CRM.N) said on Tuesday it was working with ChatGPT creator OpenAI to add the chatbot sensation to its collaboration software Slack, as well as bring generative artificial intelligence to its business software generally.

The San Francisco-based company said technology it is calling EinsteinGPT would combine its proprietary AI with that of outside partners, including OpenAI, to help businesses generate email drafts, customer-account information and computer code. ChatGPT also would integrate with Slack to help users summarize conversation threads and handle other queries.

The move reflects a race among technology companies to outfit their tools with generative AI, which can create new text, imagery and other content based on inputs from past data.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), for instance, has announced that technology from OpenAI - a company in which it is investing - can generate meeting notes in its product Teams, as well as suggest email replies to vendors through its Viva Sales subscription. Teams competes with Slack.

Clara Shih, a general manager at Salesforce, said in a press briefing that the announcement responded to demand by businesses for the nascent technology. She said Salesforce's proprietary data and AI models would help differentiate its offering.

Salesforce's generative AI tools would help companies “completely reimagine how they engage with their customers,” she said.

Salesforce also announced a fund to invest in generative AI startups.

792,115,Microsoft,2023-03-08,Microsoft tells UK it will license 'Call of Duty' to Sony for 10 years,"













LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) said it would license Activision Blizzard's (ATVI.O) ""Call of Duty"" (CoD) to Sony for 10 years to address concerns raised by Britain over its $69 billion takeover of the games maker, according to a document published by the regulator.

Microsoft last month struck a similar deal with Nvidia Corp's (NVDA.O) gaming platform, dependent on it getting the go-ahead for the much-contested acquisition.

Microsoft President Brad Smith had said he hoped that rival Sony - which has strongly opposed the takeover - would consider doing the same type of deal.

Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in February said the deal could weaken the rivalry between Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation, and stifle competition in cloud gaming.

It suggested that structural remedies could be needed to allay its concerns, including divesting the business associated with 'Call of Duty.'

Microsoft, in its response to the CMA's findings, said the package of remedies it would offer protected all CoD players in Britain and provided substantial benefits to consumers and developers.

""Microsoft is proposing a package of licensing remedies which (i) guarantee parity between the PlayStation and Xbox platforms in respect of CoD and (ii) ensure wide availability of CoD and other Activision titles on cloud gaming services,"" Microsoft said in the document published on Wednesday.

It added that it believed that the criteria for the CMA to consider behavioural remedies, such as those offered, had been met.

Sony, in its own submission to the CMA, rejected Microsoft's proposals, saying the only way to preserve competition in consoles and cloud gaming was to block the deal or subject it to a structural remedy, such as making Microsoft sell CoD.

The biggest-ever deal in gaming, announced in January last year, is facing scrutiny in the United States and in Europe.

Microsoft is expected to secure EU antitrust approval with its offer of licensing deals to rivals, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this month, helping it to clear a major hurdle.

The CMA will rule on the deal on April 22.

793,368,Microsoft,2023-03-08,Australian regulator to monitor rapid growth in digital platforms sector,"













March 8 (Reuters) - The Australian competition regulator said on Wednesday it would probe the country's fast-evolving ecosystem of digital platform service providers as part of a five-year inquiry into the sector.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said consumers and businesses are becoming increasingly dependent on products and services offered by digital platforms such as Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Meta (META.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), and it's crucial to examine how these giants are expanding their reach in the country.

The regulator said it will look into procedures adopted by the sector such as creating confusing interfaces known as ""dark patterns"", which can ""manipulate users into taking certain actions"", as well as conditional service offerings, also known as ""tying"", that restrict access to particular services.

""Interconnected products ... can provide consumers with a seamless experience that simplifies everyday tasks, but it's important that competition and consumers are not harmed as digital platforms invest across different sectors and technologies and expand their reach,"" ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said.

ACCC also published an issues paper, seeking feedback from consumers, businesses and relevant stakeholders concerning the investment choices made by digital platforms and the potential effect on competition and consumers.

This follows the ACCC announcing in January that it had conducted a sweep to identify misleading testimonials and endorsements by social media influencers across a range of digital platforms.

794,416,Microsoft,2023-03-08,"Startup from ex-Apple team raises $100 million, works with OpenAI","













March 8 (Reuters) - Humane Inc, a startup founded by former Apple Inc (AAPL.O) employees, said on Wednesday it has raised $100 million and will release its first products this spring.

The company, founded in 2018 by Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, has now raised $241 million but has yet to disclose what it is building, saying only that it is a ""software platform and consumer device built from the ground up for artificial intelligence.""

A video posted by the company and patent filings suggest that a wearable device will project information onto the real world and allow users to manipulate that information with their hands.

Humane also said that it is collaborating with OpenAI, the creator of AI products such as ChatGPT that can generate human-like conversational text and Dall-E that can generate images, to integrate OpenAI's technology into Humane's device.

Sam Altman, OpenAI's founder and a previous Humane investor, participated in funding round on Wednesday, the company said.

Humane also said that Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), which has built a massive cloud computing infrastructure specifically for AI, took part in the funding round.

Humane said it will partner with Microsoft's cloud to bring Humane's software services platform to market.

""Our products are built on an integrated device and cloud platform that will allow us, and others, to create AI-driven experiences that feel natural, fun and needed,"" Patrick Gates, another Apple veteran who is Humane's chief technology officer, said in a statement.

Humane also said that it is working with Korean electronics giant LG Electronics Inc (066570.KS) ""on potential (research and development) projects for the next phase of Humane products"" and with Volvo Car's (VOLCARb.ST) Tech Fund on ""a potential future collaboration which would be the first example of Humane’s offering being applied to the automotive industry.""

795,579,Microsoft,2023-03-08,M&A bankers trip over their cracked crystal balls,"













LONDON, March 8 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ask any investment banker about the year ahead and the answer is almost always the same: “The pipeline is pretty full!” The optimistic and usually empty phrase conceals a grab-bag of methods used to forecast transactions, none of which is particularly rigorous. The inability of dealmakers to predict the volume or size of mergers and acquisitions makes hiring tough, and arguably undercuts the value of their counsel.

The M&A pipeline generally has three components: announced deals that are almost certain to happen; announced deals that may not get over the line; and deals that have neither been announced or perhaps even conceived. The first group, like Advent International’s $6.4 billion Maxar Technologies (MAXR.N) buyout, is relatively easy. The target’s shares trade a whisker below the offer price, indicating that it’s probably just a matter of time until Maxar’s advisers at JPMorgan (JPM.N) pocket their $55 million of outstanding fees on the deal.

The second variety tends to be trickier. Maybe a pushy investor such as Paul Singer’s Elliott Management wants a higher price from the buyer, or competition authorities are circling, as with Microsoft’s (MSFT.O) $69 billion offer for Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O), the developer of “World of Warcraft” and other video games. Bankers might then apply a discount to the raw figures. Activision’s shares trade roughly halfway between the offer price and where JPMorgan analysts estimate they would be if Microsoft walked away. The fees, including $55 million payable to boutique Allen & Co. upon closing, could thus be tabulated at around half of face value.

The third category, transactions that haven’t even started yet, is where things get silly. Bankers constantly discuss permutations with their C-suite clients, but can’t be sure whether they will actually pull the trigger, or what they might pay their advisers for the relevant guidance. Will a rival technology giant such as Apple (AAPL.O) or Microsoft buy Netflix (NFLX.O)? Could First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB.AD) revive its interest in $27 billion Standard Chartered (STAN.L)? Other deals aren’t even on the radar: no adviser began 2022 expecting billionaire Elon Musk to buy Twitter, let alone for a lofty $44 billion.

FINGERS IN THE AIR

Dealmakers address this uncertainty partly by using “top-down” measures, including surveys about just how assured chief executives are feeling about the economy, their businesses and other factors. Corporate bosses are more likely to initiate deals when they’re feeling bullish. The correlation is only modest, however: confidence among U.S. CEOs surged in 2010 without a resulting M&A boom. Conversely, animal spirits were falling in late 2014 and throughout 2015 as strategic transactions surged.

Reuters Graphics

There’s a much tighter relationship between equity markets and M&A, implying that CEOs pursue corporate marriages when their share prices are high. This link doesn’t help bankers much with their forecasts. If they know where the stock market is heading, they should be working at a hedge fund instead.

One common way to get around this problem is to look at the value of announced deals as a percentage of total worldwide market capitalisation. On average since 2001, it has been about 9%, according to Breakingviews calculations based on the average annual dollar value of the MSCI All Country World Index and Refinitiv M&A data. The theory is that a low read one year indicates latent dealmaking potential and therefore a reversion to the mean and an imminent rebound. If true, that would be encouraging for 2023, since 2022 was a trough in which $3.6 trillion of announced deals represented just 6% of the $60 trillion in market value.

Reuters Graphics

Even so, the historic average skews upwards because of a dealmaking frenzy in the years before the 2008 global financial crisis. And the measure is imprecise. The difference between an 8% and a 9% year is $600 billion of deals, based on the index’s current value, or almost one-fifth of last year’s total. There’s a similar vagueness to other indicators favoured by bankers, such as high corporate cash balances and stockpiles of capital available to private equity. Both numbers indicate that potential acquirers have money to hand, but not when or how they’ll spend it.

WEAKNESS IN NUMBERS

Unsurprisingly, given all the uncertainty, some bankers take their pipeline estimates with an appropriately large pinch of salt. Perhaps that’s not a problem – after all, they’re paid for doing deals, not predicting them. Still, it’s hardly a great look. Advisers are selling companies their wisdom and powers of analysis. They present boards with intricate financial models to project corporate sales for years, or to estimate deal-related cost savings and revenue boosters. How much faith should boards and shareholders put in those numbers if bankers can’t even get their own industry’s basic figures right?

Another problem is that it’s hard to run any business without a firm grip on future sales. Hiring and firing on Wall Street and in London’s Square Mile tends to come in waves, and typically lags the deal cycle. At the start of an M&A boom, banks often find themselves overworked and short-staffed. One adviser conceded that his employer turned down prospective clients during the 2021 deal surge because there weren’t enough people to work on them. Banks then often over-hire at the peak of activity. Revenue roughly halved last year in the investment banking divisions of big U.S. lenders, contributing to layoffs across the industry.

Bankers are hardly alone in struggling to forecast M&A. Brokerage analysts have proven to be incapable of properly predicting revenue for publicly traded advice shops like Moelis (MC.N), whose top line heavily depends on deal fees. Yet that just goes to undermine all the breezy talk of how much business is flowing through the plumbing. Perhaps the pipeline is indeed full, but sometimes just with hot air.

796,434,Microsoft,2023-03-09,"Discord to roll out AI-powered chatbot, messaging features","













March 9 (Reuters) - Chat app Discord said on Thursday it will introduce new artificial intelligence features that can summarize long conversations or add decorations to a user's avatar, the latest move among tech companies to build generative AI tools.

Generative AI, which has captured the attention of the tech industry, is a technology that can generate images, text or video in response to a prompt.

Startups like OpenAI and tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google (GOOGL.O) have introduced or announced AI chatbots that can synthesize web information to answer complex searches or even write original novels. read more

""We're seeing one of the most exciting moments in technology emerging,"" Jason Citron, chief executive of San Francisco-based Discord, said during a press briefing.

Discord, which lets groups of users chat by text, video and voice, said it will revamp a bot called Clyde, who will now be powered by OpenAI technology. Discord users can invoke the AI-powered Clyde to answer trivia questions, help schedule meetings or recommend playlists, the company said.

Another AI feature will let users ""remix"" their friends' avatars using generative image models. For instance, the feature could place a crown on a person's head in their profile image to celebrate their birthday.

If users have been away from Discord and missed a stream of messages, an AI tool will be able to summarize the conversation and allow users to quickly jump back to parts of the message thread to catch up on the discussion. The tool will begin to roll out next week in a limited number of Discord groups, the company said.

Discord said it will also experiment with OpenAI technology to improve an existing content moderation tool that helps automatically block harmful or unwanted messages from a Discord chat. The revamped tool can flag messages to moderators and also understand the context of the conversation, the company said.

797,437,Microsoft,2023-03-09,OpenAI to enable more customizations for enterprise and individual users,"













March 9 (Reuters) - OpenAI, the creator of the buzzy chatbot ChatGPT, will release tools to give users more control over the generative AI system, while improving the models for both general and specific use cases, its CEO Sam Altman said Thursday.

Speaking to investors at a Morgan Stanley conference, Altman said the AI company will focus on building a platform that sells APIs to others and creates killer apps like ChatGPT.

Since its launch in November, ChatGPT's popularity has surged as traffic to the site hit more than 1 billion visits, up from 616 million in January, according to Similarweb estimates. OpenAI has launched a subscription tier of ChatGPT where users can pay $20 per month for more reliable services.

The Microsoft-backed company is working with enterprise clients to train its models in particular domains and has effectively reduced hallucinations, incidents when an AI system confidently gives a response that is factually incorrect, according to Altman.

Management consultancy Bain & Company, has struck a global services partnership with OpenAI, enabling Bain to embed AI in its client operations.

Enterprises that work with OpenAI can use their data and make a copy of the model to alleviate data safety concerns. Coca-Cola, for example, is working with OpenAI and Bain to use OpenAI's ChatGPT and DALL-E platforms to create personalized ad copy, images, and messaging.

Altman, a veteran entrepreneur and investor, said the company should be valued by investors as a firm to achieve the goal of general artificial intelligence.

Individual users should also have more control over how the AI works, Altman added. The company said last month it is developing an upgrade to its chatbot that users can customize to address concerns about bias in artificial intelligence.

""We'll launch more things soon that give users additional control on the system to behave this way or that way.""

Altman acknowledges the AI system cannot achieve 100% accuracy, and he said he expects applications including AI doctors and AI lawyers to emerge on people's phones soon.

798,553,Microsoft,2023-03-09,Groq adapts Meta's chatbot for its own chips in race against Nvidia,"[1/2] A GroqNode rack of Silicon Valley AI chip startup Groq is seen installed at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, U.S., March, 2023. Groq Inc./Amanda Dalton/Handout via REUTERS















OAKLAND, California, March 9 (Reuters) - Groq, a Silicon Valley chip startup founded by a former Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) engineer, said on Thursday it has adapted technology similar to the underpinnings of the wildly popular ChatGPT to run on its chips.

Groq modified LLaMA, a large language model released last month by Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) that can be used to power bots to generate human-like text.

The move is significant because Meta's researchers originally developed LLaMA using chips from Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), which has a market share of nearly 90% for AI computing according to some estimates. Showing that a cutting-edge model can be moved to Groq's chips easily could help the startup prove that its products are a viable alternative to Nvidia.

Groq has been trying to chip away at Nvidia's market share, along with startups such as SambaNova and Cerebras and big companies like Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O).

Efforts to find alternative chips to Nvidia's have gained extra steam with the popularity of ChatGPT which has focused attention on Nvidia's dominant role in AI. The public battle to dominate the AI technology space kicked off late last year with the launch of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT and prompted tech heavyweights from Alphabet to China's Baidu Inc (9888.HK) to trumpet their own offerings.

Meta made its code available to researchers for noncommercial use. Groq used Meta's model but stripped out the code that was included in order to make the model run on an Nvidia chip, Groq CEO Jonathan Ross told Reuters.

Groq then ran that model through Groq Compiler which automatically adds specific code for it to run on its own computing system. A compiler turns code into ones and zeros so a chip can read them.

Ross said the company's goal is to make it easy to move models from Nvidia's chips to its own. He said using the Groq system can also eliminate engineering effort each time changes are made to the LlaMA or other models to get it to work on the chips.

Meta Platforms declined to comment. The company has been working on making it easier for developers to use non-Nvidia chips and in October launched a set of free software tools for AI applications that enable switching back and forth between Nvidia and AMD chips.

799,312,Microsoft,2023-03-09,Oracle banks on Cerner for cloud boost after mixed third-quarter results,"













March 9 (Reuters) - Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) narrowly missed quarterly revenue estimates on Thursday, but the company remained bullish on demand for its cloud software following the recent acquisition of electronic medical records firm Cerner.

Oracle has been beefing up its offerings with a focus on subscriptions to win large customers and better compete in the booming cloud services market dominated by tech heavyweights Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).

On a conference call with analysts, company executives said Oracle expects to sign more healthcare customers over the next few quarters.

Cloud revenue jumped 45% to $4.1 billion in the third quarter.

However, while hybrid work has helped growth, a rally in the U.S. dollar has also hit the bottom-lines of multinational firms such as Oracle, with the company's net income in the third quarter falling to $1.89 billion from $2.32 billion a year earlier.

Oracle earned $1.22 per share on revenue of $12.39 billion in the quarter ended Feb. 28, while analysts were expecting a profit of $1.20 per share on revenue of $12.42 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

The mixed results sent shares down over 3% in trading after the bell.

The company forecast fourth-quarter revenue to grow between 15% and 17%, compared with analysts' estimate of 16.2%.

Oracle also expects adjusted profit per share in the range of $1.56 to $1.60, above market expectations of $1.46.

800,824,Microsoft,2023-03-09,Is the standard essential patent a certainty for the field of uncertainty — quantum technology?,"Law firms Haynes and Boone, LLP Follow















March 9, 2023 - Where the first quantum revolution upended our understanding of the world, the second quantum revolution is radically altering how we design our technology. Just as the semiconductor replaced vacuum tubes and is now ubiquitous in our technology, the implements of quantum computing, quantum communication, quantum sensing, and quantum optics are likewise poised to replace current technologies. Quantum — in particular quantum mechanics — refers to the measurement and operations (or behavior) of matter and light on the atomic and subatomic scale.

Our quest to understand and control matter and light at these subatomic scales has made the rules of quantum mechanics unavoidable. In our highly interconnected world, the replacement of vital technologies with new ones is bound to require new technology standards. And in a standard-setting environment, the Standard Essential Patent (SEP) is the goose that lays the golden egg.

SEPs are an integral part of many industries — such as telecommunications. In industries where a new standard has developed, often promulgated by a standard-setting organization (SSO), patents that are critical to implementing the standard may be designated by the SSO as SEPs. And because inventions are often improvements over previous developments, companies are likely to innovate against the backdrop of an industry standard, which means they will need to practice the patents that are critical to the standard to practice their own patents. However, while patents are creatures of statute (e.g., the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act in the United States and other law codified in Title 35 of the United States Code), SEPs are not recognized by the law as a unique subset of patents. Instead, when a patent is determined to be a SEP, the owner of the patent is required to license and negotiate under fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (or ""F/RAND"") terms.

Thus, while there is no statutory provision for a private right of action that is particular to SEPs, the commitment to provide licenses on F/RAND terms has been held by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the 2012 case, Microsoft v. Motorola, to create a contractual obligation in cases where a prospective licensee would be a third-party beneficiary. In addition to claims under contract law, claims under federal antitrust laws have also been made, e.g., in the Northern District of Texas 2020 case, Continental v. Avanci. With this framework in mind, the next section discusses the industries likely impacted by quantum technology and the standard-setting bodies that currently promulgate standards for those industries.

In the second quantum revolution, the design principles for our technology will themselves utilize quantum mechanics. By doing so, new capabilities will emerge in such varied industries as telecommunications, semiconductors, and computing more generally. Current technologies in those industries are already governed by a wide array of standards promulgated by a number of organizations, including the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), International Telecommunications Union (ITU), Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), International Standards Organization (ISO), and Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA), to name a few. Many of these organizations have recognized the second quantum revolution is occurring.

For example, the ITU ran a focus group on ""Quantum Information Technology for Networks."" ITU-T Focus Group on Quantum Information Technology for Networks (FG-QIT4N), Int'l Telecomm. Union. Attention placed on quantum technology by these SSOs is not occurring in a vacuum — the market for quantum technology and the number of patents issued covering it are increasing. Many of these projects are in their infancy; however, market trends make it clear that quantum technology is an area for growth.

The domain of quantum technology has seen rapid growth on several fronts. Market size for quantum technology is expected to grow at double-digit percentage rates. See Matt Swayne, ""Quantum Computing Market Expected to Grow at Double-Digit Rate"" The Quantum Insider (Dec. 27, 2021). And investment in this area of deep technology is beginning to ramp up. See Mateusz Masiowski et al., ""Quantum Computing Funding Remains Strong, But Talent Gap Raises Concern,"" McKinsey & Co. (June 15, 2022).

The growth in the number of patents being sought in quantum computing has only just begun. See Elliott Mason, ""Trends in Quantum Computing Patents,"" Quantum Econ. Dev. Consortium (May 24, 2021). And over half of quantum-related patents in recent years have gone to companies outside the set of recognizable technology companies. Id. In light of this landscape, companies need to be cognizant of a number of considerations during development of their quantum technology.

While racing to beat their competitors in this new technological frontier, companies need to be sure they are protecting the patentable advances they generate. Patenting serves a number of purposes beyond suing another party for infringement. Importantly, for a young company, patents are a way to communicate value to prospective investors. In addition, a company that lacks the will or resources to practice their patent may still generate revenue through licensing. And while current quantum technology may not currently be mature enough for widespread adoption, companies should keep in mind that future standards may develop based on current patentable innovations.

SEPs are likely a certainty for fields related to quantum technology. Therefore, companies should look for opportunities to direct the development of those standards: first, because it is in their self-interest; and second, because a standard that is forged from contributions by the greatest number of stakeholders will be a better standard. If a company is interested in creating a portfolio of SEPs, it is advisable to continually evaluate patenting efforts to appropriately declare innovations as essential to a standard when appropriate (e.g., after a thorough evaluation of the patent claims and standard documents), to avoid the perception of under-declaration or over-declaration.

Companies must also consider the legal enforcement landscape. A series of policy statements by the Department of Justice, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology on the remedies available in SEP-related disputes reveal an unsettled legal landscape. For the most recent stance taken, see ""Withdrawal of 2019 Policy Statement on Remedies for Standards-Essential Patents Subject to Voluntary F/RAND Commitments,"" published June 8, 2022.

While such policy statements do not have the force of law, it is unclear how courts will interpret policy statements and the impacts those statements will have. See generally Congressional Research Service, ""General Policy Statements: Legal Overview,"" prepared by Jared Cole and Todd Garvey, Washington: Library of Congress, Apr. 14, 2016. The most recent proposed guidance from 2021, titled ""Draft Policy Statement on Licensing Negotiations and Remedies for Standards-Essential Patents Subject to Voluntary F/RAND Commitments"" and ultimately not adopted, observed that the relevant factors would ""generally militate against an injunction"" in a dispute involving SEPs.

Nevertheless, the guidance discusses situations where an injunction may be an appropriate remedy. Another legal consideration is the variation in legal regimes between countries and the likelihood of enforcing a judgment obtained in one jurisdiction in a different jurisdiction. Unfortunately, the legal regime that should facilitate the use and protection of a standard is itself not standardized. Companies will therefore have to be cognizant of two shifting landscapes: technology and law.

801,779,Microsoft,2023-03-10,SVB collapse a sign of pain coming from end of easy-cash era,"













LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - The easy-cash era is over and its impact is only just starting to felt by world markets yet to see the end of the sharpest interest rate hiking cycle in decades.

Risks were brought to a fore this week as U.S. tech specialist Silicon Valley Bank was shut by California banking regulators on Friday, sparking a rout in bank stocks. SVB was seeking funds to offset a hit on a $21 billion bond portfolio, a result of surging rates, as customers withdrew deposits.

Central banks meanwhile are shrinking their balance sheets by offloading bond holdings as part of their fight against hot inflation.

We look at some potential pressure points.

1/ BANKS

Bank have shot up the worry list as the SVB rout hit bank stocks globally on contagion fears. European banks slid on Friday after JPMorgan (JPM.N) and BofA (BAC.N) shares fell over 5% on Thursday.

SVB's troubles stemmed from deposit outflows as clients in the tech and healthcare sectors struggled to raise cash elsewhere, raising questions over whether other banks would have to cover deposit outflows with loss-making bond sales too.

In February, U.S. regulators said U.S. banks had unrealised losses of more than $620 billion on securities, underscoring the hit from rising interest rates.

Germany's Commerzbank issued a rare statement playing down any threat from SVB.

For now, analysts saw SVB's issues as idiosyncratic and took comfort from safer business models at larger banks. BofA noted European banks' bond holdings have not grown since 2015.

""Normally speaking, banks would not be taking big duration bets with deposits, but with such rapid rate rises it is clear why investors could be worried and are selling now and asking questions later,"" said Gary Kirk, partner at TwentyFour Asset Management.

2/ DARLINGS NO MORE

Even after a first-quarter surge in stock prices, higher rates have dampened the willingness to take punts on early-stage or speculative businesses, especially as established tech firms have issued profit warnings and cut jobs.

Tech firms are reversing pandemic-era exuberance, cutting jobs after years of hiring sprees. Google owner Alphabet plans to axe about 12,000 workers; Microsoft, Amazon and Meta are together firing almost 40,000.

""Despite being a rate sensitive investment, NASDAQ has not responded to the implications of interest rates. If rates continue to rise in 2023, we may see a significant sell-off,"" said Bruno Schneller, a managing director at INVICO Asset Management.

3/ DEFAULT RISKS

The risk premium on corporate debt has fallen since the start of the year and signals little risk, but corporate defaults are rising.

S&P Global said Europe had the second-highest default count last year since 2009.

It expects U.S. and European default rates to reach 3.75% and 3.25%, respectively, in September 2023 versus 1.6% and 1.4% a year before, with pessimistic forecasts of 6.0% and 5.5% not ""out of the question.""

And with defaults rising, the focus is on the less visible private debt markets, which have ballooned to $1.4 trillion from $250 billion in 2010.

In a low rate world, the largely floating-rate nature of the financing appealed to investors, who can reap returns up to the low double digits, but now that means ballooning interest costs as central banks hike rates.

4/CRYPTO WINTER

Bitcoin staged a recovery at the start of the year but was languishing at two-month lows on Friday .

Caution remains. After all, rising borrowing costs roiled crypto markets in 2022, with Bitcoin prices plunging 64%.

The collapse of various dominant crypto companies, most notably FTX, left investors shouldering large losses and prompted calls for more regulation.

Shares of crypto-related companies fell on March 9, after Silvergate Capital Corp (SI.N), one of the biggest banks in the cryptocurrency industry announced it would wind down operations and sparked a crisis of confidence in the industry.

5/FOR SALE

Real estate markets started cracking last year and house prices will fall further this year.

Fund managers surveyed by BofA see China's troubled real estate sector as the second most likely source of a credit event.

European real estate reported distress levels not seen since 2012 by November, law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges found.

How the sector funds itself is key. Officials warn European banks risk significant profit hits from sliding house prices, which is making them less likely to lend to the sector.

Real estate investment management firm AEW estimates the sector in UK, France and Germany could face a 51 billion euro debt funding gap through 2025.

Asset managers Brookfield and Blackstone recently defaulted on some debt tied to real estate as interest rate hikes and falling demand for offices in particular hit property values.

""The reality that some of the values out there aren't right and perhaps need to be marked down is something that everyone's focused on,"" said Brett Lewthwaite, global head of fixed income at Macquarie Asset Management.

802,140,Microsoft,2023-03-10,GM explores using ChatGPT in vehicles,"













March 10 (Reuters) - General Motors Co (GM.N) is exploring uses for ChatGPT as part of its broader collaboration with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), a company executive told Reuters.

""ChatGPT is going to be in everything,"" GM Vice President Scott Miller said in an interview last week.

The chatbot could be used to access information on how to use vehicle features normally found in an owners manual, program functions such as a garage door code or integrate schedules from a calendar, Miller said.

""This shift is not just about one single capability like the evolution of voice commands, but instead means that customers can expect their future vehicles to be far more capable and fresh overall when it comes to emerging technologies,"" a GM spokesperson said on Friday.

The news was first reported by website Semafor, which said that the American automaker was working on a virtual personal assistant that uses AI models behind ChatGPT.

Earlier this year, Microsoft announced a multi-billion dollar investment in ChatGPT-owner OpenAI and said it aims to add the chatbot's technology into all its products.

Microsoft, like other big tech companies, has been ramping up its efforts to embed more technology in vehicles, from infotainment systems to automated driving to operating systems that control battery performance and multiple other functions of a vehicle.

GM in 2021 partnered with Microsoft to accelerate the commercialization of driverless vehicles.

Shares of GM were down about 2% on Friday amid a broader drop.
